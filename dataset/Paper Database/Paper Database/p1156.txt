Influence of tumour stage at breast cancer detection on survival
in modern times: population based study in 173 797 patients
Sepideh Saadatmand,1 Reini Bretveld,2 Sabine Siesling,2,3 Madeleine M A Tilanus-Linthorst1
Objectives
To assess the influence of stage at breast cancer
diagnosis, tumour biology, and treatment on survival
in contemporary times of better (neo-)adjuvant
systemic therapy.
Prospective nationwide population based study.
Nationwide Netherlands Cancer Registry.
Participants
Female patients with primary breast cancer diagnosed
between 1999 and 2012 (n=173 797), subdivided into
two time cohorts on the basis of breast cancer
diagnosis: 1999-2005 (n=80 228) and 2006-12
(n=93 569).
Main outcome measures
Relative survival was compared between the two
cohorts. Influence of traditional prognostic factors on
overall mortality was analysed with Cox regression for
each cohort separately.
Compared with 1999-2005, patients from 2006-12 had
smaller (≤T1 65% (n=60 570) v 60% (n=48 031);
P<0.001), more often lymph node negative (N0 68%
(n=63 544) v 65% (n=52 238); P<0.001) tumours, but
they received more chemotherapy, hormonal therapy,
and targeted therapy (neo-adjuvant/adjuvant systemic
therapy 60% (n=56 402) v 53% (n=42 185); P<0.001).
Median follow-up was 9.8 years for 1999-2005 and 3.9
years for 2006-12. The relative five year survival rate in
2006-12 was 96%, improved in all tumour and nodal
stages compared with 1999-2005, and 100% in
tumours ≤1 cm. In multivariable analyses adjusted for
age and tumour type, overall mortality was decreased
by surgery (especially breast conserving),
radiotherapy, and systemic therapies. Mortality
increased with progressing tumour size in both cohorts
 , but without a significant
difference in invasive breast cancers until 1 cm
 , and
independently with progressing number of positive
lymph nodes .
Conclusions
Tumour stage at diagnosis of breast cancer still
influences overall survival significantly in the current
era of effective systemic therapy. Diagnosis of breast
cancer at an early tumour stage remains vital.
Introduction
Rates of survival with breast cancer have increased significantly all over the world in the past decades.1-3  In
the United States, the five year relative survival rates for
women with breast cancer have improved from approximately 75% in 1975-77 to 90% in 2003-09.4  This
improvement in survival can mainly be explained by an
effect both of earlier diagnosis as a result of breast cancer screening and awareness and of better treatment
options.5 6
The risk of metastases and death increases with both
breast cancer size at detection and number of axillary
lymph nodes involved.7-10  Screening aims to improve
survival by decreasing the risk of metastases through
early detection of breast cancer. In the Netherlands, the
national breast screening programme with biennial
mammography was implemented for all women aged
50-69 years in 1989, and in 1998 the programme was
extended to age 71-75 years.11
Next to tumour size and lymph node involvement,
cancer related factors that influence survival are
tumour grade, hormone receptor status, and human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).8-12  Surgery,
the cornerstone of breast cancer treatment, changed in
the study period: to assess lymph node positivity, sentinel lymph node biopsy was first described in Dutch
guidelines in 1999,13  although regional implementation
had already started. The proportion of patients with
early stage breast cancer who had sentinel lymph node
biopsy increased from approximately 9% in 1998 to
more than 70% in 2003.14  Recently, Mittendorf et al
published data indicating that in patients with small
breast cancers lymph node micro-metastases are not of
any prognostic value.12 An explanation might be the
increasing effectiveness of systemic ­therapy.
What is already known on this topic
Survival decreases with increasing tumour size and number of positive lymph
nodes at detection of breast cancer, but data on these prognostic factors in patient
cohorts after 2004 are scarce
(Neo-)adjuvant systemic therapies have improved significantly since 2004, and
breast cancer survival rates have increased
To what extent stage at breast cancer detection, in terms of tumour size and number
of positive lymph nodes, still determines survival in contemporary times is
What this study adds
Relative survival of female breast cancer patients in a Dutch nationwide population
based study of two time cohorts improved from 91% to
96% at five years’ follow up
Tumour size and nodal status still have a significant and major influence on overall
mortality independent of age and tumour biology in the current era of more
conservative surgery and newer systemic (neo-)adjuvant therapies
Early stage at detection is vital; surgery is crucial, and more conservative surgery is
more favourable

In more recent years, (neo-)adjuvant systemic treatment for breast cancer has improved considerably and
is applied more often. Improvements include the use of
trastuzumab, which significantly increases both short
term and long term prognosis in HER2 positive breast
cancer patients.15 16  Trastuzumab treatment was implemented in the Netherlands between 2005 and 2006.17 18
Moreover, a switch to more effective chemotherapy regimens has occurred. CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) was prescribed to 90% of breast
cancer patients receiving chemotherapy in 2000 and to
almost none in 2005.19  It was gradually replaced by the
more effective anthracyclines , which in turn were partly replaced by regimens
containing taxane.19
Data published on the effect of screening and better
treatment options on survival were based on cohorts of
patients with breast cancer diagnosed in 2004 at the
latest, and changes to more recent systemic therapy
had not yet occurred. Traditional prognostic factors,
such as tumour size and number of positive lymph
nodes, may no longer predict survival in the current era
of new systemic therapy; and if these factors do affect
survival, the size of this effect is unknown. To quantify
the effect of traditional prognostic factors, both long
term and in the current era, we describe overall survival
of female patients with breast cancer from two time
cohorts in a nationwide population based study using data from the Netherlands
Cancer Registry.
Patient population
We selected women diagnosed as having primary breast
cancer between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2012
from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. We excluded
patients with a previous history of invasive cancer or
lack of information on both clinical and pathological
tumour size.
The Netherlands Cancer Registry is a nationwide prospective population based cancer registry in which all
newly pathologically confirmed malignancies in the
Netherlands are recorded. New malignancies are
detected through the national pathology archive
(PALGA), in which all pathological reports from Dutch
hospitals are collected. Trained registrars from the cancer registry collect characteristics of patients and
tumours and details of primary treatment directly from
the patients’ medical records. Vital status and date of
death, if applicable, are verified by linkage to the
municipal administration. Last date of linkage was 31
December 2013. Follow-up was complete for all women,
except those who emigrated out of the Netherlands
before that time.
Patient involvement
Regular contact of SSiesling and MMAT-L with members
and representatives of the breast cancer patients’
organisations the Netherlands Breast Cancer Association (NBCA), Pink Ribbon, and A Sister’s Hope made the
relevance of the outcome measures of this study clear
for patients in making informed decisions about treatment and screening. Patients were not further involved
in the design of the study. Patients will be informed of
the results of this study through the websites of the
NBCA, Netherlands Cancer Registry, and Dutch Cancer
Society and information evenings of Pink Ribbon and a
Sister’s Hope.
Procedures
We subdivided patients into two time cohorts—1999-2005
and 2006-12—on the basis of their breast cancer diagnosis. We chose these cohorts because from 2005 onwards
chemotherapy schemes used were changed, trastuzumab was implemented,17  and Dutch guidelines were
more liberal on who should receive adjuvant treatment.18 We did analyses of the 1999-2005 cohort to confirm long term effects of traditional prognostic factors
on survival in earlier times in our Dutch population-wide cohort.
The following data were registered: date and age at
breast cancer diagnosis, tumour characteristics, local
and systemic therapy, vital status, second primary
breast cancer, date of follow-up, and date of death.
Local recurrence and occurrence of distant metastases
were not registered by the cancer registry. Second primary breast cancer was defined as contralateral ductal
carcinoma in situ or invasive epithelial breast cancer.20
For local breast therapy, we used the most extensive
surgery performed within one year of diagnosis. Data
on whether patients had axillary lymph node dissection
was registered all years, but data on sentinel lymph
node biopsy procedure was registered only from 2011.
Staging of primary tumours was based on the American
Joint Committee on Cancer pathological cancer staging
classification, seventh edition.21  If pathological tumour
size was missing, we used clinical stage based on imaging studies and clinical examination. Tumour stage was
defined according to the greatest dimension of the largest tumour size (Tis=ductal carcinoma in situ, T1a=≤0.5
cm (including micro-invasion), T1b=>0.5 cm and ≤1 cm,
T1c=>1 cm and ≤2 cm, T2=>2 cm and ≤5 cm, T3=>5 cm,
T4=any size with direct extension to chest wall and/or
skin). Lymph node status was described according to
the number of regional lymph nodes with pathologically proven metastasis. Determination of lymph node
positivity included results of sentinel lymph node
biopsy. Lymph nodes with only isolated tumour cells
were defined lymph node negative (N0=no pathologically proven positive lymph nodes, N1=1-3 positive,
N2=4-9 positive, N3= ≥10 positive). Grading of tumours
was based on the modified Bloom and Richardson grading system.22 Patients were considered oestrogen positive and progesterone positive in case of more than 10%
nuclear staining. Hormone receptor status was registered from 2005 and onward, and HER2 status was registered in the Netherlands Cancer Registry from 2006

stage distributions, lymph node status, and tumour

characteristics between the two time cohorts. We
assessed differences in age distribution at breast cancer
diagnosis as a continuous variable with the Mann-Whitney U test and also assessed them with a χ2 test after
categorical subdivision.
We defined overall survival as time from diagnosis of
breast cancer to death from any cause.23  We defined relative survival as the relative excess risk of death or the
observed survival of our study population divided by
the expected survival of the corresponding general population by sex, age, and year of diagnosis.24 We calculated relative survival by using the Ederer II method. We
used Dutch national life tables from the Central Bureau
of Statistics (CBS) to estimate expected survival in the
general population. We estimated relative five year survival rates and plotted relative survival curves stratified
for tumour stage and nodal stage. Women were censored at date of last follow-up. As the follow-up of
women in the two time cohorts differed considerably,
all analyses were stratified for time period of breast cancer detection.
We developed Cox univariable and multivariable
proportional hazard models for overall mortality for
invasive breast cancers to estimate hazard ratios with
95% confidence intervals. We used Cox regression univariable and multivariable analyses only for invasive
breast cancers, because hormone receptor and HER2
status are not routinely determined for ductal carcinoma in situ tumours in the Netherlands and including
them in analyses would make inclusion of these factors
into multivariable analyses impossible. To compare
differences in hazard rates between the two time
cohorts, we did additional analyses and limited maximum follow-up time for both cohorts to five years. We
did not include hormone receptor and HER2 status, as
these were unavailable in the oldest cohort; to compare
hazard rates between the two time cohorts, we built a
similar model but ductal carcinoma in situ was
included. In multivariable analyses, we included all
relevant clinicopathological variables and variables
with a P value below 0.05 in univariable analyses. We
found the assumption of proportional hazards to be
valid by graphically plotting the log-log survival
curves. We considered a two sided P value of 0.05 or
less to be statistically significant. We analysed missing
values as a separate unknown group within the same
variable. We present hazard ratios with corresponding
95% confidence intervals and used the rule of four to
ensure that the rounding error was less than 1.3% for
all ratios.25 We used SPSS Statistics for Windows (version 20.0) for statistical analyses and SAS (version 9.4)
for relative survival.
Characteristics of patients and tumours
In the Netherlands, 173 797 female patients were diagnosed as having primary breast cancer with known
tumour stage between 1999 and 2012: 80 228 (46%) from
1999 to 2005 and 93 569 (54%) from 2006 to 2012.
Tumour size was defined clinically, instead of pathologically, for 11 929 (6.9%). Median age at diagnosis was
59.3 years for the cohort of 1999-2005 and 60.0 years for
the 2006-12 cohort; continuous age distribution was
comparable (P=0.169). However, when we categorised
age at breast cancer diagnosis (supplementary figure),
we found a significant difference between the distribution in age categories of 1999-2005 and 2006-12
(P<0.001). Compared with 1999-2005, tumours diagnosed in 2006-12 were smaller (≤T1 65% (60 570/93 569)
versus 60% (48 031/80 228); P<0.001) and were more
often lymph node negative (N0 68% (63 544/93 569) versus 65% (52 238/80 228); P<0.001) and low grade (invasive cancers grade 1 21% (17 334/93 569) versus 16%
(11 939/80 228); P<0.001). Patients recently diagnosed
as having breast cancer more often had breast conserving therapy (54% (50 313/93 569) versus 48%
(38 638/80 228); P<0.001), whereas axillary node dissection was performed less often (P<0.001). Uptake of
radiotherapy and systemic therapy was increased
(P<0.001): hormonal therapy by 10%, chemotherapy by
7%, targeted therapy (mainly trastuzumab) by 7%, and
the combination by 7%. Hormone receptor status was
available for invasive breast cancers in the most recent
cohort of 2006-12 only. Oestrogen receptor was negative
in 13 876 (17%), positive in 67 993 (82%), and unknown
in 1352 (2%) of 83 221 invasive breast cancers diagnosed
in 2006-12. Progesterone was negative in 26 268 (32%),
positive in 53 557 (64%), and unknown in 3396 (4%).
HER2 status was negative in 67 418 (81%), positive in
10 899 (13%), and unknown in 4904 (6%). Table 1 shows
further results.
Relative and overall survival
Median follow-up was 9.8 (range 0-15) years for the
first cohort and 3.9 (0-8) years for the second cohort . During follow-up, 27 924 events
occurred in the first cohort and 11 177 in the second
cohort. We plotted relative survival curves for both
tumour stage (fig 1 ) and nodal stage (fig 2 ). Compared
with 1999-2005, five year relative survival rates and
overall survival rates were higher for the 2006-12
cohort for all tumour and nodal stages (table 2). Relative survival of ductal carcinoma in situ was 100%
after 15 years for the 1999-2005 cohort and 101% after 8
years for the 2006-12 cohort. Relative survival
decreased with increasing tumour and nodal stages,
except for T1b versus T1a . Relative survival in the 1999-
2005 cohort did not decrease after nine years for all
tumour sizes T1c or smaller and after 13 years for
tumours T2 or larger. In the 2006-12 cohort, no
decrease in relative survival was seen in tumour sizes
T2 or smaller after six years and for tumour sizes larger
than T2 after seven years.
Prognostic factors: cohort 1999-2005
We did Cox regression univariable and multivariable
analyses only for invasive breast cancers. Patients with
breast surgery classified as “other” were excluded from
analyses, owing to the small numbers (n=93 in all
patients with invasive breast cancer in both time
cohorts) and heterogeneity of this group. Of 73 245

patients diagnosed as having invasive breast cancer
between 1999 and 2005, 26 717 (37%) died during follow-up. With univariable and multivariable Cox
­regression analyses, we assessed influence on overall
mortality of age, second primary breast cancer, tumour
and nodal stage, grade, morphology, breast surgery,
axillary lymph node dissection, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, and radiotherapy. Cox
regression univariable and multivariable analyses
showed that after correction for the above factors,
higher tumour stage and lymph node positivity
increased overall mortality (table 3).
Prognostic factors: cohort 2006-12
In the 2006-12 cohort, 10 778 (13%) of 83 191 patients
with invasive breast cancer died during follow-up. In
Cox regression univariable analyses, all clinicopathological variables were significantly associated with
overall mortality (table 4). In multivariable analysis,
we adjusted for age, tumour and nodal stage, grade,
morphology, hormone receptor and HER2 status,
breast surgery, axillary lymph node dissection, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy,
radiotherapy, and second primary breast cancer.

associated with overall mortality, although tumour
size had a significant influence only when larger than
1 cm (T1b v T1a: hazard ratio 1.04, 95% confidence
interval 0.88 to 1.22; P=0.677). Positive hormone receptors lowered the hazard rate of death by 20-30%
(P<0.001), in contrast to positive HER2 status which
lost significance in multivariable analyses (hazard
ratio 1.00, 0.93 to 1.08; P=0.933). Axillary lymph node
dissection increased the hazard rate (hazard ratio 1.29,
1.21 to 1.38; P<0.001), and breast conserving therapy
decreased it (0.87, 0.81 to 0.93; P<0.001). Treatment
with chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, and radiotherapy all led to lower hazard rates
(P<0.001). Contrary to univariable analysis, second
primary breast cancer had no effect on overall mortality in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 1.01, 0.93 to
1.11; P=0.762).
Prognostic factors: comparison between 1999-2005
and 2006-12 cohorts
To compare the hazard rates of the two time cohorts, we
also did multivariable Cox regression analyses restricting follow-up time to a maximum of five years (supplementary table). Hazard rates for overall mortality were
lower for all tumour stages and lymph node stages in
2006-12 compared with 1999-2005. Hazard rates for ductal carcinoma in situ were significantly lower than the
reference category T1a in both time cohorts.

­primary breast cancer in two time cohorts: 1999-2005
and 2006-12. Notably, we observed a 17% increase in
diagnosis of breast cancer between the two time periods. Part of this might be explained by the ageing
society, as increasing age is a major risk factor for
breast cancer. Between 1999-2005 and 2006-12, the
Dutch female population grew by approximately 2.7%
but the female population aged 60-69 years grew by
approximately 23%.26 Median age at diagnosis of
breast cancer was around 59 years, with a peak
around the menopause (age cohort 50-59 years).
Tumours diagnosed in the most recent cohort were
smaller, more often lymph node negative, and more
often low grade than tumours from the first time
period. Five year relative survival rates improved in
the recent cohort in all tumour stages, to 100% in all
tumours 1 cm or smaller and to 98% for tumours
between 1 cm and 2 cm, and improved increasingly
with larger tumour size. Relative survival increased
especially in women aged over 75 years.
In univariable and multivariable analyses, both
tumour stage and lymph node status had a significant
influence on overall survival in both cohorts (P<0.001).
The importance of early detection is dual—with
increasing tumour size, lymph node positivity also
increases.27 We determined the influence of stage corrected for both tumour biology and treatment. We
found no difference in hazard rate for breast cancers
sized 1 cm or smaller, neither with long term follow-up
nor in recent times . When
node negative, these patients do not regularly get
adjuvant therapy in the Netherlands even when oestrogen receptor negative. With 100% five year relative
survival rates, simplifying the next edition of the
pathological tumour classification by combining T1a
and T1b into one extremely favourable category seems
justified.
Patients with breast cancer diagnosed between 2006
and 2012 had breast conserving therapy more often and
axillary lymph node dissection less often (P<0.001),
owing to the increasing use of sentinel lymph node
biopsies over the years.14  Although tumour stage was
more favourable in patients in the 2006-12 cohort,
uptake of all forms of (neo-)adjuvant systemic therapy
was increased (P<0.001), mainly due to the extended
indication in Dutch guidelines from 2005 onward,18 as
well as possibly to down staging of tumours treated
with neo-adjuvant therapy.
Surgery is of prime importance for survival, and
breast conserving therapy conferred a favourable survival compared with mastectomy despite correction
for stage, age, and adjuvant therapies (hazard ratio
0.87, 0.81 to 0.93; P<0.001). In the 2006-12 cohort, axillary lymph node dissection, advised only for patients
with positive lymph nodes confirmed by sentinel node

Conclusion and policy implications
In conclusion, our population-wide study in 173 797
female patients is the first to use such recent data to
assess the effect of traditional prognostic factors such
as tumour size and nodal status on survival. Our results
can aid both policy makers on national programmes
and physicians in clinical decision making, as well as
informing patients about the effect of stage and treatment choices on their prognosis. Furthermore, our data
are of special importance for research trials that often
use prognosis per tumour stage as primary outcomes.
Tumour size and nodal status still had a significant and
major influence independent of tumour biology in the
current era of more conservative surgery and the new,
more effective, and widely applied systemic (neo-)
adjuvant therapies. Our results emphasise the importance of tumour stage at diagnosis of breast cancer, as
it still greatly affects overall survival.
