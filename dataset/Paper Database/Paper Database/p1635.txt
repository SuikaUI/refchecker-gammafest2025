Chimpanzees are among the few mammals that engage in lethal coalitionary aggression
between groups. Most attacks on neighborsoccur when partiesmade up mostly of adult males
patrol boundaries of their community’s range. Patrols have time, energy, and opportunity
costs, and entail some risks despite the tendency of males to attack only when they greatly
outnumber their targets. These factors may lead to a collective action problem. Potential
bene ts include protectionof community members, particularlyinfants; range expansion and
increases in the amount and quality of food available; and incorporation of more females
into the community. Males may not share these equally; for example, those able to obtain

large shares of matings may stand to gain most by participating in patrols and to lose
most by refraining. Despite the attention that boundary patrolling has attracted, few relevant
quantitative data are available. Here, we present detailed data on boundary patrolling and
intergroup aggression in a chimpanzee community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda,
that is unusually large and has more males than any other known community. Males there
patrolled much more often, and patrol parties were much larger on average, than at two
other sites for which comparative data exist. Our  ndings support the argument that male
participationvaries along with variation in potentialgains, in willingnessto take risks, and in
skill at handling these risks. Both the overallfrequencywith which individualmales patrolled
and their willingness to join patrols as others set off on them were positively associated with
variation in mating success, in participationin hunts of red colobus monkeys, and in hunting
success. Males patrolled relatively often with others with whom they associated often in
general, with whom they often groomed, and with whom they formed coalitions in withincommunity agonism. This indicates that they were most willing to take risks associated with
patrolling when with others they trusted to take the same risks.

Introduction
Only a few mammalian species are known to engage in aggression in
which coalitions from one social group make lethal attacks on members of
neighboring groups . These include several
social carnivores , as well
as two omnivorous primates that commonly hunt mammals . Lethal intergroup
aggression is associated with  ssion-fusion social systems in hyaenas,
wolves, chimpanzees, and humans in small-scale societies. Lone individuals
and those in small temporary associations (parties) are subject to attack
by larger parties that encounter them in zones of range overlap or during
territorial incursions .
Chimpanzees live in  ssion-fusion communities, within which individuals form parties of varying size, composition, and duration .
Males are philopatric, whereas most adolescent females transfer from their
CHIMPANZEE BOUNDARY PATROLS
natal communities into neighboring communities and some parous adult females transfer secondarily . Males are antagonistic to those of
other communities and are sometimes highly aggressive to extra-community
females. In at least some populations, males regularly patrol the boundaries
of their territories and sometimes make incursions into neighboring territories. Females and adolescent males sometimes accompany them. Males are
wary and appear to be searching for neighbors or to be gathering information about their possible location. Responses to any neighbors they encounter
vary from precipitous  ight to stalking and sudden, intense attack . Relative party size is probably the most important in uence on variation in the course and outcome of intergroup encounters, and
concerted attacks seem unlikely unless one side greatly outnumbers the other
 . Lethal intergroup attacks other
than infanticides, associated with patrols and incursions, are known from
Gombe in Tanzania and from
Kibale in Uganda and have been inferred in
the Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania .
Attackers probably face low risk of injury when they have overwhelming numerical superiority, especially because one or more of them typically
try to immobilize the victim while others attack it . Still,
attackers presumably face some risk of wounding, and males engaged in a
patrol or incursion may meet equally strong or stronger antagonistic parties
that retaliate . Males rely on each other’s support
to minimize such risks. Patrols can last for hours and also have energy and
opportunity costs. Possible compensating bene ts can be subsumed under
the ‘imbalance of power’ hypothesis, which proposes that successful attacks
on members of neighboring communities result in general dominance over
those communities . In turn, this can lead to better access to food resources and, consequently, to higher female reproductive success ; to more mating opportunities for males ; and to improved safety . All males should bene t if effective patrolling and
success in intergroup aggression leads to improved safety and, in principle,
other bene ts could also be distributed equitably. However, ‘free riders’
might then patrol less often than others and exploit their willingness to
assume associated costs . Cheating may not be dif cult in a
 ssion-fusion society, especially one with many males, because individuals
are often not together and cannot have perfect information about others’
behavior. One way to cheat would be to avoid boundary areas, and thus to
be absent at the start of many patrols . Another would be for a male to
refrain when he has an opportunity to join a patrol — that is, to stay behind
when others he is with set off. In that case, others have information about his
behavior and may punish him, withhold cooperation from him in the future,
or otherwise alter their behavior in response.
However, not all males would necessarily bene t equally from increased
female reproductive rates, improved infant survival, or the inclusion of more
females in their community. For example, if high rank confers reproductive
advantages, currently high-ranking males may be particularly inclined to
participate in patrols because they have relatively many current offspring.
Males who can expect to attain and sustain high rank may also patrol often
because their expected number of future offspring is relatively high. By the
same token, males with low current reproductive success and poor future
prospects have less to lose by refraining from patrols. The extent to which
individual males participate in community defense and inter-community
aggression may depend on how much they stand to lose if neighbors make
successful incursions, and how much they stand to gain in the future if they
can expand their territory at the expense of neighbors. Males who patrol
relatively infrequently may not be cheating.
Patrols have time, energy, and opportunity costs, and they entail some risk
of injury in aggressive encounters with neighbors. Males who patrol often
may be advertising their ability and willingness to take risks, in situations in
which risk minimization depends on cooperation. That is, patrolling may be
a form of costly signaling . One possibility is
that patrolling advertises a male’s quality as a mate, but this could only work
CHIMPANZEE BOUNDARY PATROLS
if females receive information about his participation. Another possibility
is that it gives other males information about his quality as an ally in
within-community competition. In turn, information about the willingness
of males to cooperate in within-community competition and to invest in
relationships that involve cooperation, e.g. by providing grooming, could
in uence decisions about whether to start a patrol, depending on which
males are actually present. If a community has enough males that they
have multiple options to form parties large enough for low-risk patrols,
individuals may be most inclined to join patrols if other participants are
reliably cooperative social partners.
Behavior during hunts of red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus badius), another activity that chimpanzees undertake in groups and in which they risk
injury , also gives information about male willingness to take risks and to cooperate and about  ghting skills. Cooperation can
increase hunting success and presumably decreases the risks that individual
hunters take . The same motivational system may underlie attacks on conspeci cs from other groups and
hunting of heterospeci cs . In any case, males skilled at hunting
may also be particularly inclined to engage in patrols, and others may be
most inclined to go on patrols when good hunters are present.
Intergroup aggression in chimpanzees has attracted much discussion, but
published data on the frequency of boundary patrols and inter-community
encounters and on individual variation in participation in these activities are
still scarce . We add to this record here by
describing boundary patrols and inter-community encounters for a recently
habituated and unusually large chimpanzee community at Ngogo, Kibale
National Park, Uganda. We have four main objectives. First, we describe the
frequency of patrolling, the size and composition of patrols, and variation
in the location of patrol routes. Second, we analyze individual variation in
the overall frequency with which males participated in patrols and examine
several hypotheses that may account for this variation. We use data on male
dominance rank and mating success for a preliminary test of the hypothesis
that individual participation in patrols correlated positively with variation in
expected bene ts from success in inter-community antagonism. We use data
on participation in hunts and hunting success to evaluate whether these were
WATTS & MITANI
positively related to willingness to patrol. We also use data on grooming and
coalition formation to test the hypothesis that males tended to patrol jointly
with others with whom they maintained strong af liative ties and cooperated
in within-community antagonism. Third, we consider the possibility that
some males cheated by refraining from joining patrols when they had the
opportunity to do so. Finally, we compare our data to those available from
chimpanzee communities at Gombe and Tai , and examine variation in patrol frequency and composition
in light of demographic variation.
Study site and subjects
We made our observations in the Ngogo study area in Kibale National Park, Uganda. The
study area comprises a mix of mature, mid-altituderainforest,secondaryforest,swamp forest,
and grasslands dominated by Pennisetum purpureum . Ghiglieri 
 rst studied the chimpanzee community at Ngogo in 1976-1978 and in 1981. Research and
habituation efforts resumed in 1991, and we started work there in 1993. Observations of the
Ngogo chimpanzee community have been continuous and habituation efforts intensive since
1995. By the time of the observations reported here, all males could be approached to within
5 to 10 m on the ground. The Ngogo chimpanzee community is the largest described thus far
 . Its exact composition is uncertain because not
all females are well habituated or individually recognizable. However, it contained 24 adult
males, 15 adolescentmales, and about 47 or more adult females, nine adolescentfemales, and
49 juveniles and infants, for a total of at least 144 members, as of mid-1999. The numbers
of males far exceed means of 7.3 adults and 3.5 adolescents for a sample of 11 chimpanzee
communities from throughout the species range .
We have followed Ngogo chimpanzees over about 35 km2 (Fig. 1) since 1993 and have a
good sense of the area within which males typically stay during normal foraging. This area
abuts the range of the habituatedKanyanchu community to the south and southwest, although
we do not know the exact extent of the shared boundary and of range overlap. It abuts the
range of at least one unhabituated community to the north and, probably, northeast. We have
been with Ngogo chimpanzees when they encountered neighbors in areas near the eastern
and southeastern edges of their range, but do not know if these belonged to the northern
community or to another unhabituated community. We also have recorded encounters to the
west and northwest with what may be a community distinctfrom those just noted. We divided
the perimeter of the Ngogo community’s range into eight straight-line sectors, each about 2
km, in order to quantify how often they patrolled in certain areas (Fig. 1). This division is
partly arbitrary,but some sector endpointscorrespondroughly to geographicfeatures relevant
to patrol routes.The trail that passes between Ngogo and the  eld station at Kanyawara forms
the western endpoint of Sector 1; the chimpanzees often use this trail as a jumping-off point
to patrol to the east and northeast. Similarly, they often cross the road in to Ngogo camp

at about the north-south coordinate that demarcates Sector 2 from Sector 3, and sometimes
swing either northeast or southeast to patrol from there. A trail that goes south from the
Ngogo trail grid system, initially along the Kanyanchu stream, and that eventually intersects
the trail grid system in the Kanyanchu study area, demarcates Sector 4 from Sector 5.
Data collection and identication of patrols
Males sometimes move long distancesnear or along known boundariesin a highly distinctive
fashion that  ts descriptions of boundary patrols from Gombe and
Tai . They travel in  le formation, with little distance between
individuals,are uncharacteristicallysilent, and usually do not feed. They often stop and sit or
stand in a tight cluster,intenselyvigilant, apparently to look and listen for other chimpanzees,
and they sometimes stop to inspect chimpanzee night nests or areas where chimpanzees have
been eating fruit. Sometimes they sniff the ground as if they can smell chimpanzee urine.
They remain highly vigilant until they have moved well back towards the center of their
We began to follow males on patrols in 1996 and have since noted that these occur at high
frequency. Most of the data reported here come from January to June, 1998, and October,
WATTS & MITANI
1998 through August, 1999, when one or both of us was at Ngogo. During these times, we
rarely lost contact with parties that had more than two to three males once we had found them
and thus were highly likely to see patrols when they occurred. During patrols, we note the
identity of all participantsand the route that they follow, collect general data on behavior,and
make detailed observations of responses to signs of other chimpanzees and of interactions
between the patrollers and conspecics encountered. We collect similar data when we are
with Ngogo chimpanzees engaged in normal foraging or other, non-patrol activities and we
hear calls from areas near boundaries or observe encounters with other chimpanzees. We are
not always certain of the community to which callersbelong, but we have documentedseveral
encounters with the habituated Kanyanchu community.
Wrangham distinguished between patrols along boundaries and deep incursions,
during which members of one community travel relatively far into a neighboring territory.
One indicationthat Ngogo chimpanzees make deep incursions is that they sometimes display
loudly on their return to an area well within their range . However,
we do not try to distinguish these from patrols here because we know too little about range
overlap with neighboring communities.
Data analysis
We used data from 1998 and 1999 to estimate the rate of patrolling. We calculated this rate
by dividing the number of observed patrols by the number of days on which we were with
chimpanzees for at least six hours; this makes our measure comparable to those of Goodall
 for Gombe and of Boesch & Boesch for Tai. This is a conservative estimate,
because we might have missed patrols on days when we saw none or only a few of the
community’s adult males.
Counting how often a male went on patrols is one measure of his engagement in such
collective actions. To test the hypothesis that adult males patrolled equally often, we  rst
calculated the total number of male ‘patrol days’ (N D 489). This was the number of times
that individual males went on patrols, summed across all males. Multiplying mean patrol
size by the number of patrols gives the same result. Parties that went on patrols were usually
large (see below). Males we saw relatively infrequently tended to be in large male parties
least often. It seemed unlikely that they were under-represented in our sample of patrols as
a result, because they were unlikely to have been patrolling, alone or in small parties, when
we were with large parties of males and they were not present. Still, we needed to consider
the possibility that the number of times we saw individuals on patrols depended simply on
how often we saw them at all. We thus counted the number of days on which we saw each
male and calculatedwhat percentage of total male observationdays this represented.We then
multiplied 489 by these percentages to calculate the expected numbers of times we should
have seen each male on patrols if this depended only on how often we saw him. We also
divided 489 by the number of males in the community to obtain an expected value of 20.4
patrols per male, under the assumption that our observations were an unbiased sample of
patrols. We compared observed and expected values with chi-square tests.
Counting the number of patrols does not necessarily indicate how willing males were to
participatewhen they had an opportunityto do so (or, conversely,how often they exploitedthe
willingness of others). As a measure of willingness, we calculated what proportion of times
each male went along when other males he had been with did a patrol.We consideredmales to
have refrained either when they did not go at all, or when they went a short distance,but then
CHIMPANZEE BOUNDARY PATROLS
dropped out while others continued.These data complementthose obtainablefrom playbacks,
which simulate immediate external threats ,
because patrols start in the absence such threats. We examined the null hypothesis that the
proportion of times that males refrained did not vary signi cantly across individuals with a
chi-square test.
We also counted how often each adolescent male went on patrols, but we probably missed
or misidentied some adolescents early in the study because most were less well habituated
than the adults and we were less familiar with them. We therefore offer only a preliminary
analysis of their participation in patrols. All results given below pertain to adult males only,
unless we specify that they pertain to adolescents.
We assessed male dominance rank on the basis of decidedagonisticinteractionsduringthe
1998-1999 study periods . We assigned equal rank to some males between
whom we saw no decided interactions. Several males rose or fell in rank during this period,
and we used their mean ranks in analyses below. There was a strong positive correlation
between the frequency with which males copulated with parous estrous females and male
dominance rank, but also considerable residual variation (Watts, unpubl. data). This raises
the possibility that (1) male rank and reproductive success are also positively correlated, but
that (2) a few males have relatively high or low fertilization success independently of rank.
We do not currently have paternity data with which to test these hypotheses. Relatively high
current success at mating and potentially siring offspring should give males a high incentive
to defend their community boundaries against intrudersand to try to expand their territory.To
investigatewhether rank and mating success in uenced the inclinationof males to participate
in patrols, we regressedpatrol participationon male rank; on male mating success, de ned as
the mean percentageof copulationsthat a male obtainedwith each of  ve parous females; and
on the residuals from the regression of mating success on rank, a rank-independentmeasure
of mating success.
To examine the relationship between male hunting behavior and participation in patrols,
we calculated the number of red colobus hunts at which each male was present and the
mean number of kills each male made per hunt (N D 82 hunts total). We then analyzed
the relationshipsbetween these measures and patrol participation.A male was ‘present’ if we
saw him while prey pursuit was underway. For various reasons (e.g. many chimpanzees are
present at most hunts, they often spread over large areas, and they can quickly switch from
watching action in the canopy to pursuing prey), we cannot accurately record how often each
individual actually pursues prey, and we consider all males present to be potential hunters
 . Most hunts at Ngogo are of red colobus;
including data from hunts of other monkey species does not change the results.
We used MATSQUAR to test for associationsbetween the number of
times each male dyad participatedin a patrol together and the following variables: grooming
between males, coalitions, and joint presence at hunts. We used data on the total duration
of grooming per dyad . Two males formed a ‘coalition’ when they jointly
directed aggression at one or more third parties; we included only coalitions directed at other
adult males. MATSQUAR is a matrix permutation program that calculates several indices of
associationbetween variablesfrom observed dyadic values, then randomly permutes row and
column values to generate sampling distributionsagainst which to test the signi cance of test
statistics derived from the original data matrix. It thus avoids problems associated with the
non-independence of dyads and with the fact that sampling distributions for dyadic values
are unknown (ibid.). We also used MATSQUAR Partial to control for the
WATTS & MITANI
number of patrols in which each male participated and then to calculate the correlations of
how often males patrolled together with the following variables: how much they groomed
with each other, how often they formed coalitions, and how often they hunted together.
Grooming data come from focal samples and representthe total duration of grooming . We used Kr tests, which give a multivariate version of Kendall’s S statistic (¿Kr)
corrected for samples sizes and ties, and used 2,000 permutations for each test. Data and
hypothesis matrices were symmetrical.
Patrol rate, size and composition
We followed chimpanzees on 52 boundary patrols. Five of these took place
during two, three-month long  eld seasons in 1996 and 1997. The others
occurred during  eldwork in 1998 and 1999 and give an estimated rate of
one patrol per 9.7 days, or 0.72 per week. This is considerably higher than
values for the Kasakela community at Gombe during 1977 through 1982
 and for the northern community at Tai
 . Patrol rates have varied over
time at Gombe, however, and patrols were most common during the period
when Kasakela males repeatedly attacked those in the Kahama community
 .
Patrols at Ngogo included three to 27 members, with a mean of 13.0 (SD
D 5.6). Patrols were almost exclusively male activities, and most participants
were adult males. The mean number of adult male participants was 9.4
(SD D 3.8, range 3-19), and the mean number of adolescent males was
3.6 (SD D 2.8, range D 0-10). One unusually large adult female who does
not undergo menstrual cycles twice joined males on patrols; this female
accompanied adult males unusually often in general. One adolescent female
also twice joined males on patrols; both times, she was in estrus. Otherwise,
females did not participate in patrols. At Tai, patrols were smaller on average
 and contained
considerably fewer males ( Nx D 5:2). However, proportionately more of the
community’s males took part in each patrol at Tai (72%) than at Ngogo
(39.2%). Also, adult females joined 57% of patrols at Tai, and a mean of 2.2
females participated in each patrol. Goodall does not provide data on
patrol composition at Gombe. However, the Kasakela community contained
means of 5.6 adult and 1.3 ‘late’ adolescent males during 1977-1982, so
CHIMPANZEE BOUNDARY PATROLS
patrols necessarily contained fewer individuals from each of these classes
than the means at Ngogo, although Gombe patrols might have contained
proportionately more of the community’s males, on average, than Ngogo
patrols did.
Two non-mutually exclusive factors could explain why patrols were more
common at Ngogo than at Tai or Gombe. First, individuals at Ngogo might
have been more inclined to go on patrols because they had more partners,
which should have decreased their risks. Alternatively, Ngogo males might
have participated in patrols at rates equal to or even lower than those at the
other sites, but patrols were more common simply because more males were
there to participate. Both possibilities  nd some support. Tai data show that
males are not inclined to patrol when associated risks are particularly high
 . The rate of patrolling at Tai dropped sharply when
the number of males declined to only four. Small patrolling parties were
also much less likely than large patrolling parties to attack neighbors on
encounter, and they usually avoided neighbors. The mean annual number
of patrols per capita was higher at Ngogo (14.2) than at Tai , suggesting that Ngogo
males were more inclined to go on patrol. However, males at Ngogo seemed
no more inclined on average to go on patrols than males at Gombe, where
the mean per capita annual number of patrols was 14.4 .
Patrol locations
Most patrols occurred near boundaries to the northeast, east, and southeast
(Fig. 1). We often followed Ngogo chimpanzees to the west in 1997 and early
1998, but by mid-1998 most males rarely traveled near or across apparent
boundaries to the west, and neared those to the southwest and northwest
much less often than more easterly boundaries. They might have shifted their
activities partly to avoid the Kanyanchu community, which is also unusually
large, in the south and southwest. However, most large fruit crops on which
they fed in the second half of 1998 and in 1999 were in the central and eastern
parts of their range.
Ngogo chimpanzees patrolled Sector 1 (Fig. 1) 20 times during an 11month interval during 1998-1999. Intervals between patrols ranged from one
to 60 days during this time, with a median of nine days. Patrolling in this
WATTS & MITANI
sector was particularly intense in June through August, 1999, with 13 patrols
in 92 days. Patrols reached Sector 2 (Fig. 1) seven times, with a median
interval of 17 days, in 1999, and twice reached this area within intervals of
a week or less. The median interval between patrols was 27 days for Sector
3 (N D 7) in 1998 to 1999. Patrols reached Sector 4 (Fig. 1) at intervals of
3, 4, 5, 7, and 11 days, but the chimpanzees also went 158 days without a
known patrol to this sector.
Encounters with members of other communities
Ngogo chimpanzees heard and/or met neighbors on 19 of 52 patrols and
on seven additional occasions while they were foraging. Most contact with
neighbors was auditory only (Table 1). Responses to vocalizations from
neighbors ranged from counter-calling, with or without approaches, to silent
 ight, to attacks (Table 1). Four times patrol members  ed after hearing pant
hoots from adult males or otherwise realizing that they were near members of
a neighboring community, and twice subsequent calls from opposing males
indicated that they pursued the Ngogo patrollers for some distance. Patrol
members  ed three times on meeting parties from the community to the
north, and once  ed from calls in Sector 7, to the west. On one of these
occasions, the patrol included only three adult and three adolescent males;
these males heard pant hoots from a party of northern males, but sat and
waited, only to  ee back towards the center of their own range when the
northern males attacked them 10 minutes later.
Ngogo males attacked presumed neighbors during seven patrols; this included two separate attacks during one patrol . They had heard vocalizations before six of these attacks, and apparently heard the strangers moving or feeding before the other two. Five attacks
led to physical aggression; in the other three, males displayed at or under the
strangers and chased several, but did not make contact (Table 2). All attacks
were on parties that included females with or without accompanying immatures, but no adult or adolescent males (Table 2). Two attacks on solitary
lactating females led to infanticides .
Sometimes when patrol members heard or met other chimpanzees they
approached and even attacked them; sometimes, they avoided or  ed from
them (Table 1). Patrolling parties that approached or attacked tended to be
larger and to include more adult males than patrolling parties that  ed or

avoided other chimpanzees (Table 1). The median number of participants
when patrols attacked or approached was 16; the median number of adult
males was 13, and of adolescent males 4. Patrols that  ed or avoided others
had a median of 11 members, with medians of 9.5 adult and 3 adolescent
males. However, these differences were not signi cant (Mann-Whitney Utests: U D 98:5, m, N D 9, 10, NS, for total patrol size; U D 97:5,

encountered others  ed or avoided them. For example, a patrol that included
only three adult and four adolescent males  ed from a party from the northern

chimpanzees twice in Sector 4 and charged at them, although without any
known physical contact between individuals (Table 2). On one of these
occasions, Kanyanchu chimpanzees  ed after some counter-calling and
counter-charging, and the Ngogo chimpanzees remained in the area. In the
second encounter, both parties left the area after counter-calling and counter-
CHIMPANZEE BOUNDARY PATROLS
charging. In another encounter, 16 adult and eight adolescent males from
Ngogo approached and counter-called with a party that included multiple
adult males after hearing calls from Sector 7, but did not meet them (Table 2).
After 0.5 hours, the Ngogo males travelled more than 1 km from the area
towards the center of their range, although not unusually quickly.
Variation in male participation
Males who were present during all observation periods participated in a
mean of 19.8 patrols (SD D 7.5, range 4-33; Fig. 2). The distribution of
patrol frequencies differed signi cantly from that expected under the null
hypothesis that males patrolled in direct proportion to the number of days on
which we observed them (Â2 D 53:13, df D 23, p < 0:001). We therefore
took our observed values as reliable estimates of how often individual males
went on patrols. The absolute frequencies with which males went on patrols
differed signi cantly from those expected under the null hypothesis of equal
participation (Â2 D 65:50, df D 23, p < 0:001; Fig. 2). The oldest
male joined only four patrols and should perhaps not be included in the
analysis, but patrol participation still varied signi cantly with him excluded
(Â2 D 52:50, df D 22, p < 0:001).

Frequency of patrolling was independent of male dominance rank (r D
0:14, df D 23, NS). The male who held alpha rank during all study
periods until April, 1999, patrolled relatively infrequently (15 times; Fig. 2).
Several other high-ranking males were also not among the most active
patrollers, while several middle-to-low ranking males were. Patrol frequency
was signi cantly and positively correlated with the mean percentage of
copulations that individual males achieved with parous females (r D 0:41, df
D 23, p D 0:04). However, patrol frequency was not signi cantly correlated
with rank-independent mating success (r D 0:29, df D 23, p D 0:17).
Hunting behavior and patrolling were strongly associated with each other.
Males who often joined hunts of red colobus also often joined patrols (r D
0:66, p < 0:001). Those who killed relatively many red colobus per hunt
participated in patrols relatively often (r D 0:43, p < 0:05). These measures
of hunting behavior were also positively and signi cantly correlated with
each other. Multiple regression models in which either number of red colobus
hunts or number of kills per hunt was entered as a  rst independent variable,
with overall mating success as a second predictor variable, failed to explain
more of the variance in patrol frequency than participation in hunts or kills
per hunt alone explained.
Joint participation in patrols
Results of Kr tests show that the frequency with which male dyads patrolled
together was positively correlated with the amount of time that they groomed
with each other (Kr D 1,362, ¿Kr D 0.24, N D 24, p D 0.0001). The
frequency of joint participation in patrols was also positively correlated with
the frequency of coalition formation between males (Kr D 974, ¿Kr D 0:22,
N D 24, p D 0.001) and with the frequency of joint participation in red
colobus hunts (Kr D 2,306, ¿Kr D 0.41, N D 24, p D 0.0005).
The number of times that males were together on patrols also increased
with the number of patrols they joined (Kr D 3,942, ¿Kr D 0.69, p D
0.0005). This raises the possibility that correlations of joint participation
with social variables might have been byproducts of a correlation between
the number of times that males were together on patrols and the number of
times that they went on patrols at all. However, matrix partial correlation tests
that controlled for overall participation in patrols showed this not to be the
case: all social variables remained signi cantly correlated with the frequency
of joint patrols (grooming: ¿xy:z D 0:10, p D 0:049; coalition formation:
¿xy:z D 0:17, p D 0.046; hunting together: ¿xy:z D 0.12, p D 0:047).
CHIMPANZEE BOUNDARY PATROLS
Refraining from patrols
On average, males had 25.5 patrol opportunities (SD D 7.2, range D 8-37;
Fig. 3) and joined 77.3% of these patrols (SD D 12.7%, range D 50.0-
97.0%). Variation in the proportion of times that males joined patrols when
they had opportunities was not signi cant overall (Â2 D 11.20, df D 22, NS)
and was independent of dominance rank (F1;22 D 1:35, r2 D 0:02, NS),
but some individual cases were notable. The oldest male, MZ, was present
at the start of only eight patrols and refrained proportionately most often
(50%). Another old male, RU, was present 25 times but refrained 12 times
(48%), the second highest value. Long-time alpha male MW refrained on
10 of 25 occasions (40%), the third highest proportion. In contrast, males
EL and HO joined the highest and second highest number of patrols, and
refrained from the lowest and second-lowest proportions (3.0% and 8.6% of
opportunities, respectively). Males BF, PI, TY (Fig. 3) also joined patrols at
most opportunities, although they had fewer opportunities than many other
males and were thus not among the most frequent participants.
Like overall patrol participation, willingness to take opportunities to patrol
was positively related to the number of red colobus hunts in which males
participated (F1;22 D 5.29, r2 D 0:16, p D 0:031) and to red colobus hunting

success (F1;22 D 7.59, r2 D 0:22, p D 0:012). The proportion of times that
males joined patrols when given the opportunity was independent of mating
success (F1;22 D 0.96, r2 D 0:04, NS). However, it was positively associated
with residual mating success (F1;22 D 4.76, r2 D 0:14, p D 0:040).
Patrolling by adolescent males
Judging from our sample of  rmly identi ed individuals, adolescent male
participation in patrols varied widely (Fig. 4). Individual adolescents participated in a mean of 12.7 patrols (SD D 9.1, range D 1-28). We do not
know the exact ages of adolescents, but variation in body size suggests that
some of this variation was age-related. Several of the smallest adolescents
were among the least frequent participants (e.g. WY, BR, RI in Fig. 4), while
most larger ones (e.g. GR, MT) went on relatively many patrols. However,
DX and CR, who patrolled most often (N D 28) and who actually participated in more patrols than all but four adults, were medium-sized, and GE,
a relatively small male, participated in the fourth-highest number of patrols
(N D 21). Our reliable data on the amount of time that adolescents spent in
parties with adult males do not cover the entire study period, but we had the
strong impression that these three males and MT (N D 23 patrols) associated
with medium-sized to large parties of adults most often among adolescents.
For adolescent males also, variation in patrol frequency was signi cantly
and positively correlated with the proportion of copulations obtained with

parous adult females (F1;13 D 37:30, r2 D 0:72, p < 0:0001). Considering
only parous adults, rather than all cycling females, probably gives a better measure of adolescent competitive ability, because adult males are more
likely to try to prevent them from mating with parous adults than with nulliparous females. In fact, adolescents obtained more copulations with adolescent and nulliparous adult females than with parous adults, but their shares
of copulations with these two classes of females were highly correlated
(r2 D 0:66, p D 0:0001). The relationship of patrol frequency to mating success is almost identical if nulliparous females are included (F1;13 D 35.80,
r2 D 0:71, p < 0:0001).
Only seven adolescent males made red colobus kills during our observations of hunts. These included six of the seven adolescents who patrolled
most often and who were all large or medium-sized (CR, DX, MT, EV, BR,
GR; Fig. 4), plus one medium-sized male who patrolled infrequently (TA;
Fig. 4). GZ, a small adolescent who often patrolled (Fig. 4) and who was
often present at hunts, did not capture any monkeys. Most other adolescents
who did not capture monkeys were also small.
Discussion
Boundary patrols at Ngogo
The Ngogo chimpanzee community has hostile relations with its neighbors.
This is evident from frequent boundary patrols, from  ights, attacks, and
chases when parties from different communities meet, and from infanticides
during patrols . It is consistent with observations of
intergroup aggression at Kanyawara, also in Kibale , and at Tai , Mahale
 , and Gombe .
As we noted elsewhere ,
our observations contradict Power’s assertion that chimpanzees are
‘egalitarian.’ Power based her argument largely on Ghiglieri’s data
from Ngogo, but the chimpanzees were not well enough habituated during
his study for observers to have been able to follow them on boundary patrols.
Ghiglieri did not see hunts at Ngogo, either, but we now know that the
chimpanzees there hunt often and with unusually high success . We have not seen fatal attacks
WATTS & MITANI
on weaned individuals in inter-community aggression, but the deaths of an
adult and an adolescent male in intergroup aggression elsewhere in Kibale
 make us suspect that these
occur at Ngogo.
Patrols were much more common at Ngogo than at Tai and Gombe , and patrol party size was much
larger. These facts were presumably related. Males in small parties are
vulnerable to potentially lethal attack , and Tai data show that males in small communities have
little inclination to risk patrolling or meeting intruders . Because so many males are present at Ngogo, occasions when enough
are together to make the risks of a patrol small are almost certainly more
common than in smaller communities. Comparisons to Tai and Gombe
suggest that variation in the number of males per community in uences
variation in patrol rate. Patrols can occur more often in a large community
than a small one even if individual males in the large community do not patrol
more often than males in the small one. Whether individuals in communities
with many males are also more inclined to patrol is unclear from the present
comparative sample.
The balance of power between communities and the level of intruder pressure also should in uence patrol frequency because they in uence the costs
and bene ts of territorial defense and of attempts at territorial expansion. For example, lionesses in Ngorongoro crater are quicker
to respond to simulated territorial intrusions than those in the Serengeti and
approach regardless of the odds; population density and competition for territories are higher in the Crater . The uneven distribution
of patrols around the perimeter of the Ngogo community’s range suggests
that they faced varying levels of competition from neighboring communities.
They might have been strong relative to the northern community, the possible
home of both infanticide victims , but did not have
a great advantage over the Kanyanchu community. Balance-of-power effects
should become clearer as we gain more information about neighboring communities.
Individual variation in patrolling
Some males at Ngogo patrolled particularly often, others infrequently. This
was partly an age effect, and patrol effort may generally show an inverted-
U shaped relationship to age that mirrors  ghting ability: low among young
CHIMPANZEE BOUNDARY PATROLS
adolescents, higher for older adolescents, higher for young and prime age
adults, then lower for old males. Small adult males and males with injuries
that cause permanent impairment (e.g. ST in Fig. 2) also have relatively low
 ghting ability and may patrol relatively infrequently, independently of age.
However, adolescents who patrolled most often were not necessarily among
the largest and, presumably, oldest, nor did age and size differences and
degree of impairment explain all variation among adults. For example, BS,
OR, and GA ( rst seen as adolescents) are about the same age and size, but
BS patrolled almost twice as often as GA and considerably more often than
OR (Fig. 2). He was also the most gregarious of these three males (Watts &
Mitani, unpubl. data).
Variation in male patrol frequency, although signi cant, did not necessarily show that some males cheated. Instead, the positive relationship between mating success and patrol frequency is consistent with the hypothesis
that the unequal distribution of patrolling effort among adult males partly
re ected asymmetric distribution of bene ts. Wrangham suggested
that the bene ts of making raids on neighboring communities increase so
sharply with increasing party size that it pays individuals to join patrols for
sel sh reasons. However, this may not be so at Ngogo, where a patrol party
that includes only a fraction of the community’s males can still easily have
overwhelming superiority over opponents. This would be especially likely
if diminishing marginal returns of raiding means that males who are relatively poor competitors receive relatively little bene t regardless of their
effort. Like male dunnocks that calibrate parental effort to re ect variation
in paternity probability , male chimpanzees may calibrate patrolling effort to re ect variation in expected reproductive bene ts.
As at other chimpanzee research sites, females at Ngogo mate with multiple
males , but the probability of gaining fertilizations
probably increases with mating success. Many males have consistently had
relatively high or low mating success throughout our observations at Ngogo
 . Increased safety resulting from successful attacks on neighbors is a common good . Individual fertilizations are not, and males presumably do not get equal numbers of fertilizations. Males with relatively many offspring and/or with good prospects for
siring offspring should have more to gain from protecting infants, improving
female foraging ef ciency, and attracting females than males with few offspring and poor prospects. They should be more willing to invest time and
WATTS & MITANI
energy in patrolling and to take associated risks. Patrolling is probably partly
parental effort, both directly (if it improves offspring safety) and indirectly
(if it increases rates of successful reproduction by females). Williams 
reached a similar conclusion in her analysis of long-term data from Gombe,
which show that increased territory size due to success in intergroup aggression led to higher female reproductive rates. Williams (ibid.) concluded that
patrolling was not mating effort, because males often attacked females and
rarely mated with their victims subsequent to those attacks. However, territory expansion can increase the number of mates available to males , so patrolling could sometimes also represent mating effort.
Males sometimes refrained from participating in patrols that they had
the opportunity to join. Individual variation in the tendency to refrain was
not great, but some males were especially likely to join patrols, and joiners
also generally went on patrols relatively often. Male EL, in particular, often
initiated and led patrols and re-started movement after patrol members had
stopped to listen. Two results support the hypothesis that male willingness
to join patrols also re ected current and expected future reproductive gains.
First, rank-independent mating success was positively correlated with the
percentage of patrol opportunities taken. Certain males, not all high ranking,
seem particularly persistent and assertive at seeking matings. Several of
these who also rarely forsook patrol opportunities have risen considerably
in rank during the time of observations reported here or since (e.g. HO and
BE; Fig. 3, unpubl. data). Second, variation in patrol frequency was also
positively correlated with variation in mating success for adolescent males.
Their likelihood of siring offspring was presumably low because their share
of copulations with adult females was always low. However, assertiveness in
mating (often in the face of aggression from adult males) and in patrolling
might be characteristics of ambitious adolescents who will eventually attain
high rank, and frequent participation in patrols may help them develop
alliances with adult males that facilitate this goal.
The presence of many males can increase the chances that individuals
cheat when they face collective action problems . However, the
consequences of cheating may be more severe in communities with fewer
males, in which the risks associated with patrolling may be too great, and/or
the chance of achieving overwhelming superiority too low, unless most or
all males participate. If males only try to start patrols when most or all are
together, they could have suf cient knowledge of each other’s participation
CHIMPANZEE BOUNDARY PATROLS
to punish cheaters , although no clear evidence of punishment
exists .
Cheating may also be more of an issue when males face direct threats,
and when failure of some to cooperate could lead to the deaths of others,
thus weakening the community’s position in competition with neighbors
 . Again, the likelihood that cheating could have such
severe consequences presumably varies inversely with the number of males
per community. Playback experiments with male lions in the Serengeti
showed that individual willingness to respond to direct threats from extrapride males did not vary, presumably because the costs that failure to
cooperate can impose on cheaters is too high . Similar
experiments with Serengeti females showed complicated variation, with
some females consistently leading approaches towards perceived threats and
others consistently lagging . We cannot address
the issue of direct threats, because patrols were not obviously responses
to them. In comparison to male lions facing the choice of whether to join
coalition partners against outside males, the cost per opportunity is probably
much less for chimpanzee males deciding whether to join others on patrols
during which they may, or may not, encounter direct risks. Groups of male
chimpanzees do not try to invade neighboring communities and evict resident
males in lion-like fashion, although gradual aggressive male replacement is
possible . Also, male chimpanzees
usually exercise great caution when opportunities for intergroup aggression
arise. Individuals may often be able to refrain from patrols without seriously
penalizing others who participate, especially when the community contains
many males and participants can still form large parties.
The dynamics of social relationships probably also in uence individual
decisions about patrol participation. Long-time alpha male MW put surprisingly low effort into patrolling, especially given that he had the highest mating success among males . Most patrols that we
observed occurred during a period when male LO reversed rank with several
other top-ranking males and then made a prolonged and successful challenge
of MW and replaced him as alpha. As his hold on the alpha position became
tenuous, MW might have refrained from patrols to avoid situations in which
he could have faced challenges. BA, who had been MW’s main ally for several years, refrained from several patrols that LO joined after LO had become
alpha; BA seemed not to want to associate with LO.
WATTS & MITANI
Patrolling and male-male bonds
Male bonding is not a necessary prerequisite for coalitionary lethal intergroup aggression in mammals, but presumably underlies its occurrence in
chimpanzees . Individual decisions to participate in activities that can lead to lethal intergroup aggression re ected the quality of
social bonds between males at Ngogo. Males patrolled most often with others with whom they often groomed and with whom they cooperated in other
contexts by forming coalitions. Males may generally be con dent that allies (regular coalition partners) and others with whom they often groom will
share the risks associated with encounters during patrols. An earlier analysis
that included a small part of the patrol sample included here produced similar results and also indicated that potential maternal relatedness did not in-
 uence joint participation in patrols . Alliance formation
in wild chimpanzees does not necessarily depend on maternal relatedness
 . Instead, as in baboons
 ,
it depends crucially on familiarity, trust, and considerations of combined agonistic power and of leverage . At Ngogo, males are probably most likely to patrol
when many are together near a boundary, or at one of several ‘jumping-off
points’ from which they move quickly to boundaries, and those present trust
each other to assume any risks.
If costly signaling theory applies to boundary patrolling at Ngogo, it may be most relevant to male bonding. Willingness to patrol may convey reliable information about competitive ability,
health, and vigor, but this probably has little direct effect on male mating
success because females rarely accompany males and thus do not receive the
information. In communities where females go on patrols more often, they
may use participation by males as signals with which to evaluate mate quality. However, males who patrol can get this information — although only by
paying the same costs and taking the same risks as signallers — and could
use it to help assess the value of signalers as potential allies . Patrollers could accrue bene ts if patrolling induces other males
to form effective alliance with them. Thus the connections of joint patrolling
to coalition formation and to grooming could go both ways. One male could
indicate to a second that he could be trusted on a patrol by forming coalitions
CHIMPANZEE BOUNDARY PATROLS
with the second; correspondingly, he could take the second male’s frequent
presence on patrols as one indication that the second would be a valuable
Boundary patrols and hunting
Males who hunted often and who were successful at killing monkeys also
were particularly likely to participate in boundary patrols. Wrangham 
summarizes the many resemblances between behavior during group hunts
and that during coalitionary attacks. For example, males show signs of
physiological arousal, like piloerection, in both contexts. At Ngogo, males
also often go on prolonged, silent searches for red colobus monkeys that
resemble boundary patrols . Our data do not resolve the question of whether monkey hunting by
chimpanzees is derived from lethal intergroup aggression . However, they
show that males highly motivated to pursue monkeys — an activity that
demands agility and that involves risk taking and coordination of one’s
own behavior with that of others — are also highly inclined to take the
risks involved in pursuing other chimpanzees. Prey pursuit provides public
information about such inclinations and about physical skills and thus also
quali es as a candidate for costly signaling, especially when males share
meat from their captures. This information is often available to females as
well as males. Males could use the behavior of other males during hunts to
assess their value as patrol partners.
Ngogo as a special case
Our observations strengthen the argument that coalitionary intergroup aggression is typical behavior for chimpanzee males . Some aspects of intergroup antagonism at Ngogo
may present males with collective action problems, but this may not be the
case for boundary patrols. Data on mating success indicate instead that variation in current and future reproductive success probably accounted for much
of the variation in the effort that males put into patrolling. We also found that
males who often took part in red colobus hunts and who often captured prey
put high effort into patrolling. Males patrolled often with others with whom
they often groomed, with whom they formed coalitions, and with whom they
WATTS & MITANI
often hunted. Thus, variation in the quality of male bonds seems to contribute
to individual decisions to go on patrols, and whether males often patrol together may in uence the quality of their social bond. Almost certainly, we
were able to show these relationships because the large number of males at
Ngogo means that average patrol size can be high even if some males patrol
infrequently. The distribution of any reproductive bene ts from patrolling
is probably skewed. For an individual with low expected bene ts, the costs
of refraining from any given patrol are probably also low. Similar relationships may not hold in chimpanzee communities with fewer males, because
achieving a suf cient imbalance of power may only be possible when patrols
consist of most or all males.
