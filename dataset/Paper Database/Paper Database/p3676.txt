ON SUBDIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS AND
DUALITY IN NON-CONVEX OPTIMIZATION
The purpose of this lecture is to give a brief resume" in an abstract setting of
some results in the theory of duality for non-convex optimisation which have beenobtained, by the author recently. These results were initially motivated by a problem arising in mechanics (treated in
3 ] ) but appear to have a larger
field of application. This lecture does not contain the applications, for which we
refer the reader to the references
§ . 1 THE GENERAL DUALITY PRINCIPLE
Let V and V
be linear topological vector spaces in separating duality, and
-> B denote the bilinear form which determines the duality between V and V
We shall consider the extremality problem
As this stage we do not make any assumptions about the behaviour of J
, and so we
might just as well consider the maximisation problem
be another pair of vector spaces in duality and let $ : VXY -»• ]R
be a functional with the following properties
^ ( u , 0 ) = - J ( u ) for all ue*V
and for each u £ V the mapping $
: Y ^ B defined by ^ ( p ) = $ ( u , p ) all pe Y
is either convex and lower semi-continuous on Y
, or has the property that
<^*(0) = ^ ( 0 ) for all u e V
This assumption is enough to ensure that an extremal principle, equivalent to p
can be defined on Y
, in much the same way as.Legendre and Hamilton proceeded
originally.
We begin by defining the Lagrangian functional
S. ( u , p
{ • < p,p > - $ ( u , p ) }
Then the dual optimisation problem is
$ : V x Y -*• B
is any functional such that - $(u,0) = Ju ,
$ (0) ^ sup ^
If <^ ( 0 ) = $ ( 0 ) for all u e V
: Immediate from previous result.
: We have used the Lagrangian £ to define a dual extremal problem, and
not to define a minimax problem equivalent to P
. The existence of a saddle-point
for £ ( £ ( , u , p
) ^ £(u.,£ ) ^ £ ( u , p * ) ) implies that ^ is a solution of
the, problem Ju^ = sup Ju. So if J is not bounded above £does not have a sadueV
die-point, but nonetheless it can be used to define the dual extremal problem P*
as we have shown.
The duality result in theorem 2 is true whether solutions for Por P* exist or
not. In our next result' we examine the relationship between solutions of P and of
Let $ : V x ' v
-^ 3R be such that
( u , 0 ) = Ju for all u e V
Suppose that
is a solution of Pand that p^€ 9$ (0). Then P* solves 9*
- £ (M^) + <H^,0) = 0
1^) + £(u,£") = 0
Proof : Because of theorem 1 it will suffice to show that
L(j^ ) = J(^).
- S, (j^ ) =
> - $(u_,p)}
{ <p,p* > - Wju.O) + < p,p* > } }
= - $(u.,0) .
£ (.".»£*)
$- S, (u,?^)
^ ^>(.u.,0)
By theorem
1 , L(j^ )= J(u^) , and. it is clear that
- £ (j"L>£*) + <H.u,0) = 0
L(p^) + £ (u.,P*) = 0
Remark : It is apparent that these extremality conditions comprise the Euler-Lagrange equations when the extremal problem arises in the calculus of variations
\_1^ , 
for further details). When we treat the important special case of
J in the form
G - F with
F convex in the next section we will see that they
are not enough to ensure that
solve ^ and P
respectively. However
the following result is true. If
and {u } C V is such that
£ (u ,p ) = - L(p*) .
if and only if
{u } is a minimising sequence for
<HU^,O) - £ (^'P ) ^ 0
AN IMPORTANT SPECIAL CASE
In order to simplify our-discussion further we shall give an analysis of the special case which lead us to the results of the previous section and of
Suppose. Ju = Gu - Fu
u c V . Then if we put
0(u,p) = F(u + p ) - Gu , for all
(u,p) c V x v
S, (u,p ) = < u,p
> - Gu - F p
In this context theorems 1 , 2 and 3 take the following more specific form
THEOREM 1 '
G ( u ) - F ( u ) ^
F*(p^) - .G*(p*)
THEOREM 2'
If F is convex and lover semi-continuous on V
inf Gu - Fu = inf
THEOREM 3'
If u £ V is such that
G(^) - F(^) = inf G ( u ) - F ( u )
Fu + F*?^ =
Remark : It is clear in this special case -why the extremality conditions E, E'
of theorems 3, V
are not enough to ensure that a pair
are solutions of
P and ^* respectively. In fact
holds if and only if
p*e3G(u,) n 3F(,u) .
We can make the' following definition. A point u £ V is a critical point of
3G(u)n3F(u)9 p* for some p* £ .V* .
It is then a natural question to ask if
E' is satisfied "by a pair
(_a,p )£V x V,
under what circumstances can we be sure that
_u is a minimiser for
(3 . In keeping with our approach throughout this lecture we want the answer in terms of subdifferentials.
F are convex functionals which are such that
8G are single-valued and hemi-continuous mappings from
V . Suppose that
u_ £ V is a critical point of
G - F in the sense which we have just
8G(u) = 3F(u)).
<3G(u), u-_u> > <3F(u),u-u>
for all u in a neighbourhood
G(u^)-F(ju) ^ G(u)-F(u) for
all u c N , and.
u_ is a local minimiser of
Proof : Let
; define the mapping
h(t) = G(tu + (l-t)jj.) - F(tu + (l-t)ju)
Now h : [o»lj "> B
is continuous and we want to show that
h(l-) ^. h(0) . By a
classical result due to Borel it will suffice to show that the lower symmetric derivative of h is non-negative at each point of
( 0 , 1 ) . In other words we must
h(t^s) - h(t-s) ^
for all t c ( 0 , 1 ) .
G((t+s)u + (l-t-s),u) - G((t-s)u + (l-t+s)_a)
< 8G((t-s)u + (l-t+s),u_) , 2s(u-u_) >
F((t-s)u + (l-t+s)_u) - F((t+s)u + (l-t-s)u_)
< 3F((t+s)u+(1-t-s)^), -2s(u-_a) > .
-——^—————s-
< 8G((t-s)u + (l-t+s)_u) - 3F((t+s)u+( 1-t-s)_u_, u-,u, >
< 3G(tu + (l-t)jj_) - 9F(tu+( 1-t)^) , u-u, > >0 .
h is an increasing function on
and the result is established. Q.E.D
Now it is obvious that there is a symmetry between problem
and problem ^
then we say that
_u_ is a critical point of
G - F . By
the same token p
is a critical point of
F - G , and we can apply theorem h
to decide whether or not
j^ is a local minimiser for ^
. But it is also
interesting question to ask whether we can deduce the local properties of ^ from
a knowledge of the local properties of
satisfy E*
, and suppose that ^ is a local
minimiser of G - F
is single-valued and continuous on V
, then p is a local minimiser
for F* - G*
;u is a local minimiser for G - F there exists a neighbourhood
N of u such that if u e N
Gu - Fu > Gu. - Fu_
Now "by the continuity of 3G
there exists a neighbourhood M of p
if p* e M then 3G*(p^) = u £ N. Thus if p £ M
, then for some u £ N
Gu + G p = <u,p
Fu + F p ^ <u,p
Gu - Fu ^ FV - GV
F p - G p = Gu - F^i
F p - G p ^ F p - G p
for all p £ M and the proof is complete.' Q . E . D .
So, in this lecture we have illustrated in an abstract setting how the subdifferenrial calculus may play a useful role in the problems of non-convex optimisation and
in the calculus of variations. In a recent paper
j^J the author has established
the results on problems of the form G - F quite independently of the considerations of section 1 of this lecture. There results on the duality of minimising sequences are established,and the theory is applied in the analysis of a problem in
mechanics. In [^ the results of section 1 are analysed in greater detail than
here, and their application to the calculus of variations is given. In particular
the Euler-Lagrange equations are seen to hold under weak hypotheses on the integrands. In
3] the duality between local properties of critical points is developed in the spirit of theorem 5 above
; but a more sophisticated context is needed
for the intended application to "the stability question for the heavy chain -which
is also treated in that paper.
