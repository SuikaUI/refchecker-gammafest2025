This handbook presents the state of the art in marketing decision models. The
book deals with new modeling areas such as customer relationship management, customer value and online marketing, but also describes recent developments in other areas. In the category of marketing mix models, the latest models
for advertising, sales promotions, sales management, and competition are dealt
with. New developments are presented in consumer decision models, models for
return on marketing, marketing management support systems, and in special
techniques such as time series and neural nets. Not only are the most recent
models discussed, but the book also pays attention to the implementation of
marketing models in companies and to applications in specific industries.
The reader can find short content descriptions of the different chapters of the
book in the first chapter.
I am very pleased that we can offer this book. Marketing decision models are
important and relevant for everyone in the field of marketing, including those
with no specific expertise on this topic. Several subsets of readers can be
distinguished for this book (partly overlapping): builders of marketing models,
users of marketing models, academics in marketing departments of business
schools (and in related departments such as decision sciences and strategy),
PhD students, marketing researchers, and consultants.
The book is also designed to cover the substantive content in marketing
models courses at the PhD and masters level.
At the completion of this book, my greatest thanks go to the authors of the
different chapters. They are world renowned specialists in their areas, people
with very busy schedules, and they have taken the time and effort to write their
chapters. In this way they provide the opportunity to others to share their
expertise. This is a great service to the field.
Second, I want to thank the reviewers. Each chapter was reviewed by two
expert-colleagues, and the authors have benefited a lot from their comments
and recommendations. A list with the names of the reviewers can be found as an
Appendix to this preface.
Next, I want to thank the colleagues who have helped with advice and
support during the preparation of this book. There were many of them, but
I want to specially thank Gary Lilien (Pennsylvania State University) who has a
lot of experience with writing books on marketing models himself, and Gerrit
van Bruggen, my colleague at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus
University. Both of them were excellent sounding board for ideas. I also want to
thank the secretaries of the marketing department at RSM, Annette Bartels and
Jolanda Lenstra for their invaluable support during the whole process.
Before setting out to write their chapters for this book, the authors got
together in the ‘‘Workshop on Advances in Marketing Decision Models’’
which was held on May 27th, 2006, in Athens (Greece). I want to thank the
Marketing Science Institute (Dominique Hanssens, then Executive Director)
and the Greek Marketing Academy (George Avlonitis, President) for their
support in organizing this workshop.
Finally, I want to mention the excellent cooperation with Fred Hillier, the
Editor of the Springer International Series on Operational Research and Management Science, and with all the persons at Springer who put a lot of effort in
the preparation, production and marketing of this book: Gary Folven, Carolyn
Ford and many others.
The field of marketing decision models started almost fifty years ago and has
been booming ever since. I hope that this book will be a useful guide for the next
phase of its life cycle, and a source of inspiration for everyone who reads it.
