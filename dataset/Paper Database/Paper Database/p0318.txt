PROLOCUTION
Si quelqu’vn me blasme de remarquer ces petites particularitez, ie luy r´epondray, que Plutarque t´emoigne qu’il
auoit receu quelque sorte de d´eplaisir d’vne chose aussi
legere: quand il se plaint de ceux qui n’auoient pas laiss´e
par ´ecrit les noms des meres de Nicias, de Demosthene, de
Formion, de Thrasybule, & de Theramines, renommez personnages contemporains de Socrate: & au contraire il monstre s¸cauoir bon gr´e `a Platon & `a Antisthene, parce que
le premier auoit ´ecrit le nom du Precepteur d’Alcibiade,
& l’autre, n’auoit pas d´edaign´e de nomer sa nourrice. La
negligence des anciens Escriuains a este si grande, qu’elle
est cause que sept villes ont est´e en dispute pour la naissance d’Homere: chacune se donnant cet honneur d’auoir
est´e la mere nourrice du plus excellent Po¨ete de la Grece;
Ce qui m’a fait toˆuiours penser, que c’est vn grand defaut `a
ceux qui se meslent d’´ecrire les Vies des Hommes illustres,
de laisser en arriere quelques particularitez, qu’on n’eust

mais qui servient infalliblement estim´ees en vn autre ciecle.

La Vie du R. P. Marin Mersenne.
There are many passages in this book where I have been at
some pains to resist the temptation of troubling my readers
with my own deductions and conclusions; preferring that
they should judge for themselves, from such premises as I
have laid before them.

I ﬁnd it impossible to write a preface to
this work, without discovering a little of
the enthusiasm which I have contracted
from an attention to it.
Joseph Priestley.
The History and Present State of Electricity.
It is generally considered bad form in writing, unless on matters autobiographic, to make unbridled use of the perpendicular pronoun. The reader of
the present book, however, may well wonder why one would want to study
the life and works of Thomas Bayes, ‘this strangely neglected topic’1, and
it is only by a reluctant use of the ﬁrst person singular on the part of the
author that this legitimate question can be answered.
It was in the late 1960s that my interest in various aspects of subjective
probability was awakened by some of the papers of I.J. (‘Jack’) Good, and
this was followed by the reading of works such as Harold Jeﬀreys’s Theory
of Probability. In many of these the (apparently simple) result known as
Bayes’s Theorem played a pivotal rˆole, and it struck me that it might be
interesting to ﬁnd out a bit more about Thomas Bayes himself. In trying
to satisfy this curiosity in spasmodic periods over many years I discovered
that little information seemed to be available. Writings by John D. Holland
in the 1960s shed some light on the matter, but it was only in periods of
sabbatical leave that I was able to undertake the intensive (and extensive)
archival research needed to ﬂesh out the shadowy ﬁgure after whom one of
the major branches of modern statistics is named.
Where, for instance, was Bayes educated? The answer to this question
presented itself by chance to me when I was visiting the University of
Chicago. While waiting for some rare volumes to be retrieved from the
depths of the John Crerar Library I happened to pick up a catalogue of
manuscripts in the Edinburgh University Library in which there appeared
details of a certiﬁcate recording the admission of Thomas Bayes as a student. Visits to Edinburgh and the generous co-operation of the library staﬀ
resulted in the ﬁnding of a number of references to Bayes in the archives
of the University.
Similar serendipity led to my ﬁnding of the proof, written mainly in
Latin, of one of the rules in Bayes’s Essay towards solving a Problem in
the Doctrine of Chances in a Notebook attributed to him and held in the
Equitable Life Assurance Society in England. This not only reinforced the
opinion that the Notebook was indeed written in Bayes’s hand, but also
shed light on matters that Bayes had thought worth recording.
Once the question of Bayes’s education had been solved, or at least answered to the best of my ability, it seemed necessary to investigate his
family and life in Tunbridge Wells, where he spent many years as Presbyterian minister. Although some information on these matters was available
from (fairly) modern writings, it seemed expedient rather to consult writers as near to Bayes as possible, and in doing so, of course, I was merely
emulating Edward Gibbon, who, in the preface to the fourth volume of the
quarto edition of his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, stressed that
he had made it his earnest endeavour always to consult the original sources.
Perhaps Gibbon, in his turn, was following the example set by Watson in
his edition of The Works of Horace:
Whoever attempts, at this distance of time, to write upon a
Classic, ought not only to read over what the most approved
commentators have written upon his works, but to compare the
same carefully with the text itself; otherwise he is in danger of
being misled: for many of them, instead of illustrating, only
darken their author, and palpably mistake his meaning.
[1792, p. v]
There are three eighteenth-century savants who are known to modern
statisticians and historians of statistics for single contributions2: Thomas
Bayes, Roger Boscovich3 and Thomas Simpson4. Bayes is known for his
Theorem, published in his posthumous Essay in 1764, Simpson for his
work in 1755 (extended in 1757) on error distribution, and Boscovich for
the posing of a question in 1757 (and its solution in 1760) on the ﬁtting
of a straight line to observational data5. Boscovich and Simpson have both
been the subject of biographies6, and it seems not inappropriate that Bayes
be similarly commemorated, particularly as the tercentenary of his birth is
In drawing to a conclusion let me say a brief word about the presentation
of material here. As regards the method of citation, works such as Bayes’s
Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances, published in
the Philosophical Transactions in 1764 in the volume for 1763, are cited
as ‘Bayes ’. In the reprinting of Bayes’s tracts, [n]
[n] indicates the end
of page nnn in the original text. If a word in the original is broken across
two pages, [n]
[n] appears here at the end of the word, with broken formulae
being similarly treated. Footnotes are given in the usual way, irrespective
of how they may be positioned (e.g., broken over two pages) in the original.
Things that appear in crotchets, [. . . ], are my corrections or additions, even
in exponents in formulae. In giving Bayes’s tracts I have allowed myself
the liberty of a light editing. In the Essay, for example, what appear in
the original as ‘a remuch mistaken’ and ‘innature’ are given here as ‘are
much mistaken’ and ‘in nature’, and ‘(a + b)b+q’ in the ﬁrst paragraph of
Proposition 7 is reprinted as ‘(a+b)p+q’. On page 
 the last occurrence
of 2Eapbq appears in the original as 2Eapbq, and the second Σ on page
 appeared originally as E. No changes are more serious than these,
and all would easily be made by the reader of the original texts.
Not being an expert in eighteenth-century history, I must bring to this
study a certain na¨ıvet´e, a quality that I hope will be seen by the reader as
touching rather than irritating and obtrusive. There are no doubt portions
of this work that could be better handled by a historian; but one of the
results of approaching a topic in ignorance is the pleasure of discovery7,
and it is with the hope of communicating some of the pleasures I have met
with in this journey through Bayes and other coves that certain passages
— for example the remarks on the Great Plague and the descriptions of
Tunbridge Wells — are presented.
I hope, though, that the reader will not view this work in the light in
which Nicodemus Boﬃn, ‘the minion of fortune and the worm of the hour’,
viewed his new mansion, viz.8
He could not but feel that, like an eminently aristocratic family
cheese, it was much too large for his wants, and bred an inﬁnite
amount of parasites.
Rather, as George Berkely put it in Siris: a Chain of Philosophical Reﬂexions and Inquiries:
The displeasure of some readers may perhaps be incurred by
surprising them into certain reﬂections and inquiries for which
they have no curiosity. But perhaps some others may be pleased
to ﬁnd a dry subject varied by digressions, traced through remote inferences, and carried into ancient times. [¶350]

My thanks are due to the staﬀat many institutions where I have spent
periods of sabbatical leave during which much of this research was undertaken: in particular, the staﬀof University College, London; Nicholas
Bingham and R¨udiger Kiesel, then of Birbeck College; and Stephen Stigler,
of the University of Chicago. I also thank H.W. Johnson, of the Equitable
Life Assurance Society, for providing me with a copy of Bayes’s Notebook.
This tribute would be incomplete without mention of my indebtedness
to Jo Currie, for her help in ﬁnding documents relating to Bayes in the
archives of the Edinburgh University Library, to Roger Farthing, for sharing his expert knowledge of Tunbridge Wells with me and for the Jeﬀery
Family Tree reproduced here with his permission, and to Jackie Sylaides,
for her typing of much of the original manuscript. I also acknowledge the
help of my colleagues Hugh Murrell, for his checking of some numerical
results using Mathematica ®, and Frank Sokolic and Brennan Walsh for
the professionally produced diagrams. Finally I thank the editorial staﬀof
Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., for their assistance.
