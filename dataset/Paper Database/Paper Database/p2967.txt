Analysing connectivity with Granger causality and dynamic
causal modelling
Karl Friston1, Rosalyn Moran1 and Anil K Seth2
This review considers state-of-the-art analyses of functional
integration in neuronal macrocircuits. We focus on detecting
and estimating directed connectivity in neuronal networks
using Granger causality (GC) and dynamic causal modelling
(DCM). These approaches are considered in the context of
functional segregation and integration and — within functional
integration — the distinction between functional and effective
connectivity. We review recent developments that have
enjoyed a rapid uptake in the discovery and quantiﬁcation of
functional brain architectures. GC and DCM have distinct and
complementary ambitions that are usefully considered in
relation to the detection of functional connectivity and the
identiﬁcation of models of effective connectivity. We highlight
the basic ideas upon which they are grounded, provide a
comparative evaluation and point to some outstanding issues.

Introduction
Several dichotomies have proved useful in thinking about
analytic approaches to functional brain architectures.
Perhaps the most fundamental is the distinction between
functional segregation and integration. Functional segregation refers to the anatomical segregation of functionally
specialised cortical and subcortical systems, while functional integration refers to the coordination and coupling
of functionally segregated systems [1]. Within functional integration, two main classes of connectivity have
emerged — functional and effective connectivity. Functional connectivity refers to the statistical dependence
or mutual information between two neuronal systems,
while effective connectivity refers to the inﬂuence
that one neural system exerts over another [2,3]. This
distinction is particularly acute when considering the
different analyses one might apply to electrophysiological
or neuroimaging timeseries.
Functional and effective connectivity
Because functional connectivity is deﬁned in terms of
statistical dependencies, it is an operational concept that
underlies the detection of (inference about) a functional
connection, without any commitment to how that connection was caused. In other words, one tests for dependencies between two or more timeseries, to reject the null
hypothesis of statistical independence. This is equivalent
to assessing the mutual information and testing for signiﬁcant departures from zero. At its simplest, this involves
assessing (patterns of) correlations — of the sort that
deﬁne intrinsic brain networks. An important distinction — within
functional
connectivity — rests
whether dependencies are instantaneous or reﬂect an
underlying dynamical process, in which causes precede
consequences. This leads to the distinction between
analyses of directed and undirected functional connectivity
that do and do not appeal to temporal precedence respectively. Common examples of techniques used to assess
undirected functional connectivity (dependencies) include independent components analysis and various
measures of synchrony, correlation, or coherence .
However, we will focus on analyses of directed functional
connectivity — of which the prime example is Granger
causality (GC) [6]. This is because coupling in the brain
is both directed and largely reciprocal (producing cyclic
graphs or networks with loops that preclude structural
causal modelling). As we will see below, GC and related
concepts such as transfer entropy (TE) rest on establishing a statistical dependence between a local measurement
of neuronal activity and measurements of activity elsewhere in the past.
Functional connectivity considers dependencies between
measured neurophysiological responses. In contrast,
effective connectivity is between hidden neuronal states
generating measurements. Crucially, effective connectivity is always directed and rests on an explicit (parameterised)
inﬂuences — usually
expressed in terms of difference (discrete time) or differential (continuous time) equations. The most popular
approach to effective connectivity is dynamic causal
modelling (DCM) [7–10,11,12]. In this context, causality is inherent in the form of the model, where ﬂuctuations in hidden neuronal states cause changes in others:
for example, changes in postsynaptic potentials in one
area are caused by inputs from other areas. The

parameters of dynamic causal models correspond to effective connectivity — usually cast as synaptic density or
coupling parameters — that are optimised by ﬁtting the
model to data. The notion of effective connectivity stems
from the pioneering work of Gerstein and Perkel in
early attempts to interpret multivariate electrophysiological recordings. At its inception, effective connectivity
referred to models; in the sense of the simplest possible
circuit diagrams that explain observed responses . In
modern parlance, these correspond to dynamic causal
models with the greatest evidence: namely, models with
the minimum complexity that furnish an accurate explanation for data (see below). In what follows, we review
recent developments in the analysis of directed functional
connectivity with GC and TE, the analysis of directed
effective connectivity with DCM and then consider the
approaches in light of each other. Figure 1 provides an
overview of recent developments in these techniques.
Granger causality and transfer entropy
The core idea behind GC is that X ‘Granger causes’ Y if X
contains information that helps predict the future of Y
better than information already in the past of Y (and in the
past of other ‘conditioning’ variables Z). The most common implementation of GC is via linear vector autoregressive (VAR) modelling of timeseries data, enabling both
statistical signiﬁcance testing and estimation of GC magnitudes [6,15,16]. However, GC is not limited to this
implementation; it can use nonlinear, time-varying, and
non-parametric models . In particular, TE 
represents an information-theoretic generalisation of GC
that does not require a parameterised model (is modelfree). Speciﬁcally, the TE from X to Y is zero if, and only if,
Y is conditionally independent of X’s past, given its own
past. Importantly, for Gaussian data, TE is equivalent to
GC [20], furnishing a useful interpretation of GC in terms
of information transfer in ‘bits’. Related approaches include partial directed coherence and the directed transfer
function; see for a review. Here we focus on the most
popular of these techniques, namely GC:
Following its introduction within econometrics [6,15],
GC has been applied in neuroscience partly because it is
simple to estimate, given (stationary stochastic) timeseries. Such data are generated by a wide range of
neuroimaging and neurophysiological methods. GC has
some useful properties including a decomposition of
causal inﬂuence by frequency [15] and formulation in
an ‘ensemble’ form, allowing evaluation of GC between
multivariate sets of responses . GC has provided
useful descriptions of directed functional connectivity
in many electrophysiological studies . Recently,
Bosman et al. [26] analysed electrocorticographic data
from macaque monkeys to show that ‘bottom-up’ signals
across multiple cortical regions were most prominent in
the gamma band, while ‘top down’ inﬂuences dominated
at beta frequencies — a ﬁnding that is strikingly congruent with neural implementations of predictive coding
 . GC can also be applied to standard EEG or MEG
signals, either at the source or sensor level (following
spatial ﬁltering to reduce the impact of volume conduction). For example, Barrett et al. [28] used source-localised EEG to show that gamma-band GC between
posterior and anterior cingulate cortices reliably increased
during anaesthetic loss of consciousness, extending
previous results obtained using (undirected) phase synchrony . We will turn to this example later in the
context of DCM.
The application GC to fMRI is more controversial, given
the slow dynamics and regional variability of the haemodynamic response to underlying neuronal activity ;
and see ‘Pros and Cons’ below. While naı¨ve application of
GC to fMRI data is unlikely to be informative, careful
consideration of the methodological issues has permitted
some useful applications that have produced testable
hypotheses. For example, Wen et al. [32] analysed fMRI
data obtained from a cued spatial visual attention task;
ﬁnding that GC from dorsal to ventral frontoparietal
regions predicted enhanced performance, while GC in
the reciprocal direction was associated with degraded
performance. These ﬁndings are consistent with the
notion that dorsal attentional regions mediate goaloriented top-down deployment of attention, while ventral
regions mediate stimulus-driven bottom-up reorienting.
In a similar paradigm, Bressler et al. found that GC
from parietal to occipital areas was predictive of behavioural performance. In a ﬁnal and unusual example,
Schippers et al. used GC of fMRI signals to analyse
directed interactions between the brains of two subjects
engaged in a social game (charades), providing novel
evidence for ‘mirror neuron system’ formulations of social
interaction. Another promising application of GC is to
intracranial local ﬁeld potentials, which possess high
temporal and spatial resolution and which comprise comparatively few variables (as compared to fMRI voxels or
EEG sensors). An early application in this area, Gaillard
et al. examined directed functional connectivity
during supraliminal as compared to subliminal visual
word processing.
Dynamic causal modelling
The basic idea behind DCM is that neural activity
propagates through brain networks as in an input-stateoutput system, where causal interactions are mediated by
unobservable (hidden) neuronal dynamics. This multiinput multi-output neuronal model is augmented with a
forward, or observation model that describes the mapping
from neural activity to observed responses. Together
neuronal and observation model comprise a full generative model that takes a particular form depending on
the data modality. The key outputs of DCM are the
parameter estimates of the (best) model, particularly

those describing the coupling among brain regions. These
allow for model and system identiﬁcation, respectively.
DCM was introduced for fMRI timeseries , where the
neuronal model comprises one or two hidden (lumped)
neuronal states for each region. The neuronal dynamics of
each region depend on the strength of connections within
that region (parameterised by a self-connection), on the
(experimental
parameters) and on inputs from other regions in the
network (the coupling parameters). Neuronal activity is
then transformed through a haemodynamic model (with
region-speciﬁc parameters) to model measured responses
 . The coupling between brain regions can then be
estimated for a particular model architecture using standard variational Bayesian techniques . In practice, it is
usual to specify different architectures or hypotheses and
formally compare the evidence for these models, before
examining parameter estimates . DCM necessarily
accounts for directed connections among brain regions
and disambiguates the neuronal drivers of a particular
event and subsequent signal propagation. Electrophysiological measurements support richer models of neuronal
dynamics in DCM that comprise sources with laminar
speciﬁc mixtures of neuronal populations. These have
evolved from kernel-based models that use postsynaptic convolution operators to describe responses at excitatory and inhibitory synapses to conductance-based
models, where particular ion channels can be modelled
and identiﬁed . These neural mass models are accompanied by linear electromagnetic forward models to generate responses at EEG scalp electrodes, at MEG sensors
or at intracranial recording sites. Application of DCM to
animal local-ﬁeld potential data has facilitated validation
studies, where independent, invasive measurements (e.g.
microdialysis or pharmacological perturbations) suggest
that DCM can be used to estimate the physiological
mechanisms responsible for mediating effective connectivity [40].
Pros and cons
Clearly, GC and DCM have complementary aims and
strengths: GC can be applied directly to any given timeseries to detect the coupling among empirically sampled
neuronal systems. This can provide useful insights into
the system’s dynamical behaviour in different conditions
or in spontaneously active ‘resting’ states. One might then
proceed to a more mechanistic (model or hypothesis —
driven) characterisation using DCM. However, this calls
for bespoke models of the system in question [41]. In
other words, GC is a generic inferential procedure characterising directed functional connectivity, while DCM is
a framework that enforces (or enables) speciﬁc models or
hypotheses to be tested. Crucially, both rest on model
selection: In DCM this involves comparing the evidence
for different models directly , while model selection
in GC is implicit in the test for the presence of GC — and
also arises in the selection of VAR model order, using
standard approximations to model evidence, such as the
Akaike or Bayesian information criteria .
Although GC is generic, its naive application is not
always justiﬁed. For example, application to fMRI must
activity and haemodynamic responses. In particular,
regional variations in haemodynamic latency could confound the temporal precedence assumptions of GC
 . While these variations can be partially controlled
for by contrasting GC between experimental conditions
 false inferences remain possible. Interestingly, recent theory and modelling suggests that GC
may be robust to haemodynamic variations but not
when combined with down-sampling and measurement
noise . In contrast, DCM models haemodynamic
variations explicitly and tries to explain the data at the
level of hidden neuronal states — in other words, it
tries to get beneath the surface structure of the data to
explain how they were generated: see [45,46] for
further discussion.
In analysis of electrophysiological timeseries, GC is more
widely accepted because there is no temporal lag between the responses recorded and their underlying
(neuronal) causes and because the data can be sampled
at fast timescales. The advantages of GC in furnishing
frequency-dependent and multivariate measures have
been clearly demonstrated [22,26,28]. However, there
is an unresolved issue in this setting — the random
ﬂuctuations assumed by GC are serially independent
(show no temporal correlations and ﬂuctuate at very fast
timescales). This is an issue because neuronal ﬂuctuations in the brain are produced by neuronal systems
that have the same time constants as the system studied.
While serial independence can be checked for, the nature
of neuronal ﬂuctuations may deserve more attention in
the future.
A key feature of DCM is that it can include variables that
describe dynamics that are hidden from observation. For
example, the GC analysis of anaesthetic loss of consciousness by Barrett et al. [28] mentioned above, was complemented by a mechanistic study by Boly et al. [47]
using DCM. She found that a DCM that included a
hidden thalamic source performed better than DCMs
based solely on observed cortical timeseries, and established a dissociation between the effects of (measured)
cortical and (inferred) subcortical structures on levels of
consciousness. In contrast to GC, being able to model
hidden sources means the model (hypothesis) space can
be very large and calls for a principled approach to
Bayesian model comparison of models that are (a priori)
considered equally plausible. The speciﬁcation and
interrogation of the model space is an outstanding conceptual issue for DCM.

DCM posits and identiﬁes neuronal mechanisms responsible for functional integration in the brain. Connectivity
in this setting necessitates biologically plausible explanations. In DCM for fMRI, new developments 
enable the incorporation of background or ongoing spontaneous cortical ﬂuctuations, nonlinearities and inhibitory
neuronal populations . The addition of spontaneous
or stochastic ﬂuctuations enhances the plausibility of the
generative model at the neuronal level, where non-Markovian noise processes sit atop experimentally induced
brain activations . In DCM for electrophysiological
data, the models will potentially allow the characterisation of receptor-speciﬁc contributions to brain connectivity, which may be important in a pharmacological and
clinical setting [11].
Conclusion
In conclusion, GC and DCM are complementary: both
model neural interactions and both are concerned with
directed causal interactions. GC models dependency
among observed responses, while DCM models coupling
generating
observations.
Despite this fundamental difference, the two approaches
may be converging. On the one hand DCM for stochastic
systems can now accommodate the random ﬂuctuations assumed by GC. On the other hand, state-space GC
approaches can incorporate modality speciﬁc observation
equations . The ability to handle large numbers of
sources for regions is facilitated by multivariate (ensemble) GC and sparse regression techniques , as
well as recent developments in post hoc model optimisation for network discovery with DCM . One might
hope that both approaches — perhaps GC disclosing
candidate models for DCM — will counter the claims
that modern brain mapping is a neo-phrenology and
provide characterisations of brain circuits that may hold
promise for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric
disorders.

This study served as a validation of DCM using non-invasive magnetoencephalography in human subjects. The experimental manipulation here

These changes at NMDA, AMPA and GABAa were recovered using a

A validation of DCMs’ estimates of synaptic coupling using intracranial
EEG from rodents was performed using an independent pharmacological
intervention. A two-region DCM (comprising for each region a three layer
cortical model with pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons in supra
and infra granular layers and spiny stellate cells in layer IV) was applied to
the steady-state summary of a timeseries from auditory cortex under 4
different doses of isoﬂurane. In line with the hierarchical conﬁguration of
electrode placement, DCM revealed a forward-backward architecture
that best described interactions between primary auditory cortex and
secondary regions, respectively. Moreover a dose effect of isoﬂurane was
observed at excitatory post-synaptic responses that corresponded to a
linear decrease, while a nonlinear increase in inhibitory responses was
commensurately observed. These measurements conformed to the
known physiological effectors of the anaesthetic. These results provide
a validation of DCM’s ability to reveal the synaptic mechanisms underlying inter-regional brain connectivity.

In this recent review the authors outline the commonalities of established
DCMs, including those for fMRI and M/EEG. They describe the importance of considering major components to DCM together namely: ﬁrst,
the neuronal model, formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations; second, the static observation model that transforms neural
activity to a haemodynamic response, third, the set of priors on model
parameters that enable in-built biological plausibility (such as negative
self-connections to preclude runaway — epileptogenic activity) and
fourth, the variational Bayesian inversion scheme that furnishes both
the evidence for a particular model and its optimal parameters after
observing the data.

In ﬁtting a wideband spectrum of responses from source-localised
EEG (incorporating slow delta and theta up to gamma oscillations), this
report used DCM to test a set of hypothesised model architectures
that could explain spectral differences between healthy human

subjects during awake, propofol and loss-of-consciousness states.
The authors used a ‘‘hidden-node’’ to represent thalamus and test
whether it takes part in generating the data from all three states. While
it was found that this hidden node was required for an optimal model
of the data, the cortico-cortical connections were shown to change
with respect to consciousness per se.
