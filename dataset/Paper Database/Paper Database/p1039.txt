A major issue confronting educators is the extent to which they wish to conform to
so-called paradigm shifts in teaching and learning. In the contemporary world of tertiary education these
shifts embrace both pedagogy (from instructivist to constructivist) and technology (from classroom to
online). As teachers and learners are faced with the potential of these new learning environments, the
extent to which learning outcomes are achieved remains a high priority and subject to a wide range of
evaluation strategies. Conventionally, evaluation has been positioned at the end of the instructional
development cycle, to assess  rst whether or not the creative effort achieved the original product goals
and second whether or not the desired learning outcomes were realized. In the context of online teaching
and learning environments, however, the level of understanding teachers, learners and developers have
of the medium can impact the ultimate effectiveness of the product. This paper articulates an additional
dimension to post-development evaluation processes in proposing proactive evaluation, a framework that
identies critical online learning factors and in uences that will better inform the planning, design and
development of learning resources. This notion of proactive evaluation advocates resource development
being undertaken where all planning activities are assessed against the evaluation criteria that would
normally be applied during formative assessment. By performing these evaluation checks proactively,
online learning resources will, in principle, work  rst time as all relevant factors and issues will have
been considered and resolved. More importantly, for those participants who are new to online
environments, proactive evaluation will perform a scaffolding and professional development role by
enhancing online teaching or learning competencies.
Introduction
While many practitioners are familiar with the issues and processes associated with the production
of online teaching and learning environments, institutions are frequently demanding their implementation without necessarily having staff competent in all aspects of online pedagogy. We
also still have much to learn about online learning environments, as research studies have
demonstrated them to have both positive and negative impacts in terms of effectiveness and
achievement of outcomes . It is therefore critical that

online development projects implement quality control processes to ensure that learners are
able to participate in effective collaborative discourse. These quality control measures result
from adherence to proven materials or instructional development processes, accreditation of
technical standards and the evaluation and assessment of the learning environment .
Evaluation strategies within the educational domain, particularly for distance and online
education, are well established and it is important to contextualize their role to accurately
position the proactive evaluation framework. In education, the most common forms of quality
assessment through evaluation are the formative and summative techniques, which are
typically conducted towards the end of the development and delivery process, respectively
 . However, other forms of evaluation
also contribute to the overall quality process.
Eastmond differentiates the evaluation of programs (for example the success of a
pre-service teacher program), projects (assessing the success of activities) and materials (the
merit or worth of content items). Using a different schema, Simonson, Smaldino, Abright and
Zvacek refer to  ve components of the evaluation process—accountability (Did the
project planners achieve their goals?), effectiveness (Were outcomes achieved?), impact (Did
the program make a difference?), organizational context (How did the organization affect the
project?) and unanticipated consequences (What happened that was not expected?). Both of
these approaches extend the work of Woodley and Kirkwood who identi ed evaluation
elements relating to project activities, ef ciency, learning outcomes, programs and policy.
While these variations on evaluation tend to conform to the process where data is collected
post facto to provide evaluation outcomes, other models include evaluation in the planning and
design stage. For example, Albrecht and Bardsley discuss this phase as focusing
on “outcomes including student learning, revenue streams, and impact on educational resources … the evaluation should drive the planning group back through the process to achieve
those outcomes most valued.” Evaluation therefore can take on various forms and be activated
during different stages of the overall development process. Where, then, does Proactive
Evaluation  t? Owen and Rogers use the concept of proactive evaluation to refer to
activities such as needs assessment, research reviews and identi cation of exemplary practice,
which appear analogous to the instructional problems phase of the instructional design process
 . Within this paper, however, proactive evaluation describes a different aspect of the
instructional development process. Eastmond cites Scriven as differentiating evaluation as follows: “when the cook tastes the soup, that’s formative; when the guests
taste the soup, that’s summative.” Continuing with this analogy, proactive evaluation is about
participants in the design process developing a shared understanding of the ingredients and the
recipes to ensure that the “soup” is appropriate for online consumption.
Proactive Evaluation
Therefore, as an extension to established forms of evaluation, and to provide speci c support
(scaffolding) for the planning and creation of online materials, this paper argues for proactive
evaluation to be integrated into this phase of the production process. Through the proactive
Enhancing Quality in Online Learning
evaluation framework, the production team will focus on the criteria by which the environments and resources might normally be evaluated, thereby ensuring that all factors associated
with a successful evaluation are addressed during the planning phase. This process will also
pre-empt the possibility of critical, negative formative and summative evaluation. Using
proactive evaluation, therefore, environments created by inexperienced people will be more
likely to achieve their educational and learning goals as this online pedagogy is integral to all
facets of the design, development and implementation process as recommended by Sims
Additionally, the underlying principles assume that the environment for which the development is being undertaken is not a traditional instructional setting, but an online collaborative
place in which the familiar classroom relationships between teacher, learner and content are
extended to enable learner-centred activities and participatory partnerships. By supporting
proactive evaluation, planning and design activities will not only ensure that all aspects of
creating online learning activities and environments are addressed, but that subsequent
formative and summative evaluation will be more directed and meaningful. Proactive evaluation also focuses the decision-making process on the complex interaction between disciplinary content, learning outcomes and online, computer-based learning environments. Better
understanding and addressing these relationships will consistently produce more effective
teaching and learning resources, and the following classi cation of factors and associated
in uences describes the framework for proactive evaluation in detail.
Strategic Intent
One of the  rst questions we always ask our clients is “Why are you attempting to place these
resources or activities into an online context?”. If they are unable to provide an explicit
answer, then we argue that the strategic intent or rationale for the product has not been de ned
adequately. Without a clear understanding of the purpose of the product and the stakeholders
who have an investment and/or interest in its outcomes, the chances of success are reduced.
Within the tertiary education environment speci cally, these stakeholders include the administration, the faculty, the development group and most importantly the students. Without full
commitment to the concept from all stakeholders, even with the best intentions, effectiveness
in terms of learning outcomes being achieved may not be realized.
The critical issue therefore is the extent to which the online component(s) being considered
will add value to the teaching and learning process. For example, if an institution decides to
“go online” without allocating suf cient funds to recreate materials so that they will be
consistent with learner–computer communication, then the decision could prove extremely
costly with few, if any, positive educational outcomes. Indeed, anecdotal feedback is suggesting a rebellion against online materials; for example, where they are perceived by faculties as
an economic solution to government cutbacks and workload increases. In other cases, where
“online” has been introduced to reduce class contact time, student anger has resulted with
resentment for being short changed, not to mention issues of quality.
Once the strategic intent has been de ned, members of the design and development team
will have a foundation on which to base the various elements of an online learning
environment, the  rst of which is content.

Many online projects have focused on the conversion of existing paper-based resources into
their digital equivalent, with a proliferation of unit outlines and study guides in either HTML

online learning, and if portrayed as such is a misrepresentation of the capabilities and bene ts
of the technology. While such materials may be accessible through the Internet and therefore
“online,” until there is an appropriate mix of motivation and engagement it does not equate to
“online learning” . We believe that online learning must
therefore be conceptualized as an environment that integrates collaboration, communication
and engaging content with speci c group and independent learning activities and tasks. If
content materials and learning activities are to be placed online, then signi cant levels of
thought must be placed on the very nature of the medium and the underlying implications for
teaching and learning.
As represented by the content options identi ed in Table 1(a), the online environment caters
for a range of content formats: from predetermined static elements to the dynamic state where
content is sourced, repurposed, constructed and enabled by and for all participants in the
learning process. Between these two extremes are the more common exemplars for delivery
of course content in terms of resource material being contributed to by both the teacher and
the learner.
For the teacher new to online learning, maximum exploitation of the online environment
means having to reassess the overall approach to the content, how it should be presented or
accessed and the relationship between teacher and learner in that process. In addition, the
options for unit or course content should be considered in terms of the interaction with the
major design issues and their impact on the learning community.
As elaborated in Table 1(b), these issues have a signi cant impact on the presentation of the
content and subject matter in the broader learning process. Implicit in this framework is the

An illustration of the interplay between content creation and design parameters can be seen
when an online environment enables learner creation of content. While the information itself
may be linked directly to the discipline, the environment enabling it to be created dynamically
may con ict with accepted organizational or design standards. In developing online content the
critical element of the process is to recognize this possibility and to be able to justify why
speci c decisions have been taken.
Having established the ways in which content must be understood within the online context,
the second factor in the proactive evaluation framework relates to the context or design into
which that content will be deployed.

Learning Design
The term learning design is used to emphasize the learner-centred environments that online
resources can provide. Taking this stance is particularly important because it forces designers
to conceptualize the development process from the learner’s perspective rather than that of the
content or the teacher. However, this does not preclude developers from adopting an
instructivist (I) or presentational strategy compared to a constructivist (C) or generative
approach, but does require careful thinking about the learner and the options provided for
interacting with the content and their learning partners. As shown in Table 2(a), the design of
resources will be in uenced by the pedagogy, outcome and resources considered appropriate
for the task.
Within the context of the design process, the team should be able to articulate the underlying
pedagogy of the product, the different types of learning being addressed and the ways that
media resources will be used to enhance the learning environment. When considered in terms
of the speci c issues that are critical to the overall design task shown in Table 2(b), the
complexity of addressing educational and technological elements of the process is further
emphasized. Embarking on the design and development of resources for online environments
requires new layers of thinking to be added to the well-established principles of course
development.
Understanding how the content and learning design will impact on the ultimate success of
the environments being developed is only part of the overall framework. For teachers and
learners encountering the online medium for the  rst time, these concepts must also be linked
with the ways that the participants interact with the actual environment, which is the focus of
the following two factors.

Interface Design
The interface between learner and computer is one of the most neglected aspects of online
learning, and when coupled with our limited understanding of the complexities of the
interactive process , extensive development has to be undertaken to achieve
successful and ongoing communication between the learner and the environment. As detailed
in Table 3(a), the options available for online productions can range from the non-contextual
through to the theatrical, where the learner can be portrayed as an active player in the overall
learning process rather than a passive observer . Our position is that
designers must spend more effort ensuring that learners are integrated into a narrative sequence
of the learning process, rather than a familiar solution which sees content being presented in
a glamorous and dynamic format but without necessarily achieving engagement with the
content through the interface.
Overall, the conceptualization of the interface must consider the strategies employed to
position the learner within the illusion created by the virtual learning environment; the way in

The major issues for Interface Design are identi ed in Table 3(b) and are linked explicitly
to the elements of Learning Design, one area that is often neglected by developers new to the
creation of online resources. To maximize the online learning experience it is not suf cient to
apply rigorous educational design to content materials, as the means by which that content
(resource, activity, conference, reading) is presented to the learner will impact on its overall
effectiveness.
The factor closely associated with interface design relates to the different ways in which

Interactivity
Interactivity is about successful communication and, in the context of online learning
environments, one of the most crucial success factors. As a component of the human–computer
relationship or encounter , interactivity can include passive presentation, navigation, undirected exploration,
directed involvement and speci c manipulation. The extent to which these constructs of
interactivity impact on the continuity of communication between learner and interface, content,
other learners or other teachers is critical to the overall effectiveness of the experience and is
inextricably linked to the factors and in uences associated with content, learner design and
interface design.
Interactivity is not simply a function of computer-based transactions, but a fundamental
success factor for teaching and learning, especially when implemented in an online context. In
most cases, regardless of any virtual community that exists, the learner will be working
independently and therefore the effectiveness of those communications (interactions) will
ultimately determine the effectiveness and ef ciency of the learning environment.
As shown in Table 4, elements of interactivity can encompass both human–computer
activity and human–human communication. Through the creative process, developers must
consider those aspects of both the design and interface that might enhance or impede the
success of the different, but often simultaneous, interactions. The ability of the learner to
“inhabit” the interactive world presented to them is naturally critical to its success as a learning
environment. The way in which the motor (navigational and control interactions), cognitive

interactions with other course participants) elements of an interaction coalesce with the task
being undertaken will contribute to the successful engagement of the learner with the activity.
To cover all aspects of the teaching and learning environment it is also necessary to focus
on the means by which the learning will be assessed, and the extent to which assessment
strategies will be created to cater speci cally for the dynamics of online communities .
Assessment
Much discussion takes place in educational institutions about how best to deploy multiplechoice or short-answer questions in online environments, and what form of authentication
should be installed to verify the electronic submission of assignments or completion of remote
examinations. However, these strategies seem to contradict those contemporary approaches to
learning that advocate active participation by learner and teacher and enable self-assessment
and re ection .
The challenge for planners and designers, therefore, is to determine how they can use online
techniques for assessment strategies and at the same time not replicate those strategies
designed for the face-to-face environment. As shown in Table 5, assessment can be teacher,
peer or student directed and within that context the way in which assessment items are
presented becomes critical. The “peer-directed” option provides means for groups to determine
and assess the learning outputs whereas the “student-directed” option provides for individuals
to de ne and pursue speci c learning outcomes. In addition, assessment may also focus on
new environments in which the performance data are collected, such as real-world workplace
environments.
As was identi ed in the introduction, online teaching and learning environments have
particular characteristics that affect both the teacher and the learner. While the discussion to
date has focused on the elements of proactive evaluation that impact on support or scaffolding
for the teacher, it is also critical that similar consideration is given to the support required for
learners who are working collaboratively and online for the  rst time. While many learners
new to universities will have excellent computer skills, it is their adaptation to the demands

of online learning—independence, collaboration, peer work—that will have signi cant impact
on its success.
Student Support
Providing appropriate support for the learner cohort is even more critical in the online
environment because in many instances they will be working independently in their preferred
environment. Even though this environment may include collaborative work, the learner’s only
medium of communication is the computer, and therefore support becomes critical to ensure
their mental model is consistent with that of the other stakeholders in the process. In addition
to the typical help systems, announcements and guides, recent research has
suggested that more explicit support is required to bring the learner into the online environment, especially by eliminating assumptions that learners will know what to do and why they
are doing it. The environments and issues that impact support are articulated in Table 6.
The remaining factors of the proactive evaluation framework focus on organizational
elements and the formative and summative evaluation strategies themselves.
Utility of Content
Within Australia, new digital copyright legislation and the proliferation of digital resources
have provided incentives to focus on the international standards for online learning environments. A crucial component of any development exercise, therefore, is to examine the extent
to which content can be used in multiple environments (within and outside the product being
developed), the means stakeholders might have to customize the materials and the interoperability between other learning objects in the wider curriculum. Complicating these factors is
the increase in legislative and compliancy conditions; at the time of writing, ensuring online
resources do not breach copyright and are accessible for learners with disabilities are part of
the quality control process. These aspects are shown in Table 7, with the assumption that
compliance achieved by ensuring a robust technological infrastructure underpins the learning
environment.

One of the complexities of online development and evaluation is that issues and factors such
as accessibility impact on a wide range of environmental and operational elements of online
learning. For example, while legislative or policy requirements might insist on online facilities
being accessible to people with disabilities, the guidelines will also impact on the look and feel
of the interface and ultimately in the communication between learner and people and objects
within the learning environment.
The  nal factor of the proactive evaluation framework is an assessment of the extent to which
outcomes have been successfully achieved. For example, measures of learning associated with
both intra-curricula and extra-curricula activities; the level of learner satisfaction with the
overall experience; the completion rates and the extent to which pass rates and grades are
consistent with alternative delivery options. Overall, the design effort needs to include items
to enable a comparative analysis of student outcomes in relation to the overall development
parameters, as shown in Table 8.
Conclusion
The capacity of computer-based technology to display combinations of media elements and
respond meaningfully to user actions and manipulations has been established for many years.
However, the power and capability of the computer to support the learning process is often lost
in a maze of marketing publicity and technical gadgetry. Unfortunately, without the requisite
Enhancing Quality in Online Learning
skills, it has become all too easy to create Web-based materials without understanding the
underlying principles of online, interactive, engaging learning. Rather than creating effective
learning environments, many development initiatives have proved to be ineffective, with
learning activities a confused labyrinth of information, links, collaboration, discussions and
navigation.
Using the concept of proactive evaluation, a strategy to enable scaffolding and support for
teachers and learners new to online environments, the factors and in uences integral to this
framework are considered critical to effective online learning. By focusing on the planning and
design phases of the development cycle, proactive evaluation addresses the critical issues
associated with the creation of learning resources and environments for delivery in an online
context to ensure they will have a greater chance of achieving educational outcomes, with both
teachers and learners gaining signi cant value from their online experiences.
Given the extent of this framework, and the importance of understanding the many factors
and layers of in uence that affect the development of effective online resources, perhaps the
critical factor is whether online developers and practitioners require a credential to practise.
Indeed, the costs of implementation and the risks of failure may well make this an imperative!
