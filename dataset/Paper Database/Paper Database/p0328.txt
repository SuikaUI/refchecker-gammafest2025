Rationale: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a class of newly discovered small RNA molecules that
function by binding to the Argonaute protein family (i.e., the PIWIL protein subfamily), and long
noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are implicated in several cancers. However, the detailed roles of ncRNAs in
glioma remain unclear.
Methods: The expression of PIWIL3, piR-30188, OIP5-AS1, miR-367, CEBPA and TRAF4 were
measured in glioma tissues and cells. The role of PIWIL3/OIP5-AS1/miR-367-3p/CEBPA feedback loop
was evaluated in cell and animal models. The association of the above molecules was analyzed.
Results: Over-expression of PIWIL3, piR-30188 and miR-367-3p or knockdown of OIP5-AS1 resulted in
inhibition of glioma cells progression. Binding sites between piR-30188 and OIP5-AS1 as well as between
OIP5-AS1 and miR-367-3p were confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays.
OIP5-AS1 knockdown or miR-367-3p over-expression contributed to a decrease in CEBPA
(CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha) protein. Furthermore, CEBPA was detected as a target of
miR-367-3p and played an oncogenic role in glioma. Treatment with CEBPA and miR-367-3p resulted in
the modulation of downstream TRAF4 (TNF receptor-associated factor 4). PIWIL3 was also a target of
CEBPA, forming a positive feedback loop in the growth regulation of glioma cells. Significantly,
knockdown of OIP5-AS1 combined with over-expression of PIWIL3 and miR-367-3p resulted in tumor
regression and extended survival in vivo.
Conclusion: These results identified a novel molecular pathway in glioma cells that may provide a
potential innovative approach for tumor therapy.
Introduction
Glioblastoma is neuroepithelium-derived and
the most malignant and invasive form of glioma
according to the pathological classification of World
Health Organization . Despite aggressive surgery
followed by adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy and
chemotherapy, glioblastoma patients have a 5-year
survival rate of less than 5% . Resistance of
glioblastoma to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is a
crucial factor affecting therapeutic efficacy. The
pathogenesis of glioblastoma has been a great
challenge in recent years requiring novel approaches
for diagnosis and targeted therapy.
The transcription products of most genes in the
human genome are non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) .
Based on the length of ncRNAs fragments, they are
divided into short non-coding RNAs and long

non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The short non-coding
RNAs mainly include microRNAs (miRNAs), short-
interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and PIWI-interacting
RNAs (piRNAs) . piRNAs are a class of newly
discovered small RNA molecules of 26-31nt in length
and generally function by binding to the Argonaute
protein family (i.e., the PIWIL protein subfamily) for
gene silencing and regulation as well as maintenance
of the germline DNA stability. Human PIWI protein
members include: PIWIL1, PIWIL2, PIWIL3 and
PIWIL4 . PIWI proteins find their target RNAs by
using piRNAs as guides and cleave the targets
through the RNase (slicer) activity of the PIWI
domain. PIWIL3 expression is deregulated in multiple
cancers. Recent studies of single-cell proteomics have
demonstrated that PIWIL3 is highly expressed in
human oocytes and is associated with development
and maturation . It has been reported that PIWIL3
is aberrantly expressed in breast and gastric
carcinoma and is related to the prognosis of
breast cancer and may serve as a new indicator for
prognosis .PIWIL3 has been shown to be highly
expressed in stage III human ovarian epithelial cancer
and its metastatic tissues . Also, the human
( 
ENSG00000184571-PIWIL3/pathology) shows that
PIWIL3 is down-regulated in gliomas. Moreover,
microarray
piRNADQ570076 (referred to as piR-30188 in NCBI
genebank) is down-regulated in U87 and U251 glioma
cells. However, the regulatory role and potential
mechanisms of PIWIL3 and piR-30188 affecting the
biological behavior of glioblastoma have not been
investigated.
sequence-specific manner. The major biological
functions of lncRNAs include regulation of gene
activation and inhibition .Current studies have
shown that lncRNAs play an important role in
tumorigenesis. When piR-30188 was over-expressed
in U87 and U251 cells, microarray analysis showed
down-regulation of several lncRNAs, and many of
these showing a 1-fold change were validated by
qRT-PCR. By using piRNA Bank and piRNA
predictor, we discovered that piR-30188 has a putative
binding site on a highly conserved lncRNA in
predominantly in cytoplasm . Its homologous
gene in zebrafish, Cyrano, is mainly involved in brain
and eye development. Knocking out Cyrano leads to a
decrease in brain and eye volume and neural tube
opening defects in zebrafish . It has been reported
that OIP5-AS1 may play a biological role as an
endogenous competition RNAs (ceRNAs) sponge
preventing RNA binding protein HuR (one of the
human embryonic lethal abnormal visual RBP family
members) from binding mRNA, thereby inhibiting
HuR expression and thus participating in phenotypic
regulation . Whether OIP5-AS1 regulates the
biological behavior of tumor cells has yet to be
elucidated.
miRNAs have a crucial role in the regulation of
gene expression and cell function, and their
involvement in tumorigenesis has been widely
reported. The regulatory network of non-coding
RNAs is related to the development of various
tumors. Studies have shown that transcripts such as
lncRNAs can recognize miRNAs through miRNA
recognition components acting as ceRNAs . It
has been reported that LncRNA-RSU1P2 binds to
let-7a, inhibits its expression, and plays an oncogenic
role in cervical cancer cells . It also promotes the
development of non-small cell lung cancer by
modulating miR-377-3p/E2F3 pathway as a ceRNA

by inhibiting miR-152 and miR-139, respectively . When OIP5-AS1 was knocked down in U87 and
microarray
miR-367-3p was one of the up-regulated miRNAs.
Also, the bioinformatics database Starbase shows that
OIP5-AS1 harbors a putative binding site of
miR-367-3p. It has been shown that miR-367-3p acts as
suppressor
over-expression of miR-367-3p inhibits invasion and
metastasis of gastric cancer cells , while decreased
expression of miR-367-3p is associated with poor
prognosis in ependymoma and high-grade glioma
patients . Yet, the expression and function of
miR-367-3p in glioma cells are still unresolved.
In our preliminary experiments, we detected that
CEBPA (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha)
was up-regulated in gliomas. Remarkably, by
searching bioinformatics databases miRanda and
Targetscan, we noticed that CEBPA harbors a putative
binding site for miR-367-3p. CEBPA is a member of
the CEBP transcription factor family that contains
basic leucine zipper (bZIP) and participates in
differentiation and energy metabolism in various
cells. CEBPA regulates proliferation and apoptosis of
zebrafish hepatocytes . It is highly expressed in
hepatocellular
knockdown of CEBPA in human hepatocellular
carcinoma suppresses the colony formation and cell
growth of Hep3B and Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma
cells via lowering the expression of cyclin A and
CDK4, suggesting that CEBPA plays an oncogenic
role in hepatocellular carcinoma . Earlier
studies have shown that CEBPA mRNA expression in
ovarian cancer is significantly increased. The elevated
Theranostics 2018, Vol. 8, Issue 4
 
mRNA was negatively correlated with the survival of
cyclophosphamide chemotherapy . Mutations in
CEBPA have also been found in acute myeloid
leukemia . Consistent with the previous findings
that miRNAs can inhibit the expression of target
genes by binding to transcription factors, miR-381 was
shown to regulate CEBPA expression, thus restraining
metastasis of breast cancer cells .

Oncomine ( we noticed
that TNF receptor associated factor 4 (TRAF4) is
up-regulated in glioblastomas. We also predicted that
TRAF4 promoter might harbor two upstream putative
binding sites for CEBPA by using bioinformatics
software JASPAR. TRAF4 is highly expressed in colon
cancer cells . It is also up-regulated in oral
squamous cell carcinoma and promotes cell growth,
migration, and invasion viaWnt-β-catenin signaling
 . However, it is not known how CEBPA and
TRAF4 might affect the biological behavior of

Materials and Methods
Human tissue samples
Human glioma specimens and normal brain
tissues were obtained from patients diagnosed with
glioma who received surgery at the Department of
Neurosurgery of Shengjing Hospital, China Medical
University, from January 2014 to January 2017. The
research methods in our study were approved by the
Institutional Review Board at Shengjing Hospital of
China Medical University. Informed consent was
obtained from all patients, and the study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of Shengjing
Hospital of China Medical University. All specimens
were immediately frozen and preserved in liquid
nitrogen after surgical resection for the ensuing
experiments. Glioma specimens were divided into
four grades (pathological grade and molecular
subtype) by three experienced clinical pathologists
according to the WHO classification of tumors in the
central nervous system : low-grade glioma
(WHO I-II, WHO I: n=3; WHO II: n=5) and high-grade
glioma (WHO III-IV, WHO III: n=9; WHO IV: n=16).
Detailed information about the glioma patients is

U251 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density
of 2,000 cells per well. After 72 h, 10 μL of CCK-8
solution was added into each well and incubated for 2
h at 37°C. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells
were then analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD
Biosciences) to acquire the apoptotic fractions.
Cell migration and invasion assay
24-well chambers with 8 μm pore size (Corning)
were used for migration and invasion assay of U87
and U251 cells in vitro. Cells were resuspended in
100μL serum-free medium at a density of 105/ml and
seeded in the upper chamber (or precoated with 500
ng/ml Matrigel solution (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ)) for
cell migration and invasion assay. 600 μL of 10% FBS
medium was placed in the lower chamber. After 48 h
of incubation, the cells on the upper membrane
surface were physically wiped with a cotton swab.
Cells that had migrated or invaded to the lower side
of the membrane were fixed with methanol and

The lentiviruses of miR-367 were transduced in
PIWIL3+sh-OIP5-AS1 cells to generate PIWIL3+sh-
OIP5-AS1+miR-367 cells. Four-week-old BALB/C
athymic nude mice were obtained from the National
Laboratory Animal Center (Beijing, People’s Republic
of China). The animals were fed with autoclaved food
and water during the study. The nude mice were
divided into five groups: Control (only U87 or U251),
PIWIL3 (U87 or U251 cells with stable over-expression
of PIWIL3), miR-367 (U87 or U251 cells with stable
over-expression of miR-367), sh-OIP5-AS1 (U87 or

(OIP5-AS1 inhibition and PIWIL3 and miR-367 stable
over-expression in U87 or U251 cells). 3x105 cells were
subcutaneously injected into the right flanks of the
mice. Tumor volume was measured every 4 days
when the tumors were obvious, and the volume was
calculated
length×width2/2. Forty days after injection, the mice
were sacrificed and tumors were isolated. For survival
analysis in orthotopic inoculations, 3x105 cells were
stereotactically implanted into the right striatum of
the mice. The number of surviving nude mice was
recorded, and survival analysis was determined using
Kaplan–Meier survival curve.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SD. All statistical

U251 cell lines were analyzed by western blotting
(Figure 1A and B). Using microarray analysis and
qRT-PCR, piR-30188 expression was found to be
down-regulated in U87 and U251 glioma cells (Figure
S1A and D). Further, piR-30118 was reintroduced in
glioma cells. lncRNA array and qRT-PCR showed that
OIP5-AS1 expression was decreased (Figure S1B and
E). PiR-30188 and OIP5-AS1 levels in glioma tissues
and cell lines were analyzed by quantitative real-time
PCR. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
showed that piR-30188 and OIP5-AS1 were localized
in both nucleus and cytoplasm but primarily in the
cytoplasm of U87 and U251 cells (Figure S2). As
shown in Figure 1A and C, PIWIL3 and piR-30188
expression was decreased and negatively correlated
with the pathological grade of glioma; the expression
levels were also low in U87 and U251 cells compared
with normal human astrocytes (P=0.0016, P=0.0023,
respectively) (Figure 1B and D). On the other hand,
OIP5-AS1 expression was positively correlated with
the pathological grade of glioma (Figure 1E).
Compared with normal human astrocytes, OIP5-AS1
was up-regulated in glioma tissues and exhibited high
expression levels in U87 and U251 cells (Figure 1F). To verify the
impact of PIWIL3, piR-30188, and OIP5-AS1 on the
proliferation of glioma cell lines, CCK-8 assay was
performed to assess proliferation. As expected, cell
proliferation
PIWIL3(+),
pre-piR-30188
sh-OIP5-AS1 groups was significantly decreased
compared with PIWIL3(+)-NC, pre-NC and sh-NC
groups (U87 cells: P=0.0017, P=0.0022, P=0.0045,
respectively; U251 cells: P=0.0015, P=0.0023, P=0.0030,
respectively). Moreover, cell proliferation in the
PIWIL3(+)+pre-piR-30188+sh-OIP5-AS1 groups was
significantly reduced compared with PIWIL3(+),
pre-piR-30188 and sh-OIP5-AS1 groups (U87 cells:
P=0.0315, P=0.0193, P=0.0157, respectively; U251 cells:
P=0.0440, P=0.0201, P=0.0210, respectively) (Figure
1G). Subsequently, flow cytometry analysis was
conducted to measure the impact on cell apoptosis. As
PIWIL3(+)-NC, pre-NC and sh-NC groups, apoptotic
ratios in PIWIL3(+), pre-piR-30188, and sh-OIP5-AS1
significantly
increased(U87
P=0.0434, P=0.0184, P=0.0143, respectively; U251 cells:
respectively).
Moreover, apoptotic ratio was magnified in the
PIWIL3(+)+pre-piR-30188+sh-OIP5-AS1
PIWIL3(+),
pre-piR-30188
sh-OIP5-AS1 groups(U87 cells: P=0.0121, P=0.0309,
P=0.0241, respectively; U251 cells: P=0.0138, P=0.0220,
P=0.0279, respectively). Transwell assays revealed
that the migrating and invading cell numbers in
PIWIL3(+), pre-piR-30188 and sh-OIP5-AS1 groups
were reduced compared with PIWIL3(+)-NC, pre-NC
and sh-NC groups(Migration analysis, U87: P=0.0026,

(Figure 1I).
PIWIL3 bound to piR-30188 and OIP5-AS1
was a target of piR-30188
It has been reported that PIWIL3, a member of
the Argonaute protein family, binds to piRNA to
influence biological functions. To verify this, U87 and
U251 cells were cotransfected with PIWIL3 and
piR-30188, and their impact on OIP5-AS1 expression
was monitored by qRT-PCR. As shown in Figure 2A,
OIP5-AS1 expression was significantly attenuated in
PIWIL3(+) and pre-piR-30188 groups (U87 cells:
P=0.0196, P=0.0245, respectively; U251 cells: P=0.0312,
P=0.0103, respectively). The suppressive effect was
PIWIL3(+)+pre-piR-30188
groups(U87 cells: P=0.0096, P=0.0017,respectively;
U251 cells: P=0.0041, P=0.0065, respectively). RNA
Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA
pulldown experiments confirmed that PIWIL3 binds
to piR-30188 (Figure 2B and C). We speculated
OIP5-AS1 might harbor one piR-30188 binding site
and searched the bioinformatics database Targetscan
(Figure 2D). To further verify our speculation, the
dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed. As
shown in Figure 2E, the luciferase activity was
significantly decreased in the OIP5-AS1-Wt+pre-
piR-30188 group compared with that in the
OIP5-AS1-Wt+pre-NC group (P=0.0013), whereas the
luciferase activities of the OIP5-AS1-Mut groups were
not affected.
MiR-367-3p was down-regulated in glioma
tissues and cell lines, acted as a
tumor-suppressor, and was a target of
oncogenic role in glioma cells, miRNA microarray
analysis was performed in glioma cells treated with
the OIP5-AS1 knockdown. As shown in Figure S1C
and F, miR-367-3p was up-regulated in cells treated
with sh-OIP5-AS1. Hence, miR-367-3p might be
involved in OIP5-AS1-mediated regulation in glioma
cells. miR-367-3p levels in glioma tissues and cell lines
were analyzed by qRT-PCR. miR-367-3p was localized
in both nucleus and cytoplasm but primarily in the
cytoplasm of U87 and U251 cells by fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) (Figure S2). MiR-367-3p
expression was decreased and negatively correlated
with the pathological grade of glioma (Figure 2F) and
showed decreased expression in U87 and U251 cells
compared with normal human astrocytes(P=0.0026
and P=0.0053,respectively) (Figure 2G). To verify the
effect of miR-367-3p on the proliferation of glioma cell
lines, U87 and U251 cells were transiently transfected
with miR-367-3p. As expected, cell proliferation in the
pre-miR-367-3p groups was significantly decreased
compared to the pre-NC groups, whereas the
anti-miR-367-3p groups exhibited higher proliferation
(U87 cells: P=0.0038; U251 cells: P=0.0022) (Figure
2H). Flow cytometry analysis was conducted to
measure the impact of miR-367-3p on cell apoptosis.
As shown in Figure 2I, the apoptotic ratio in
pre-miR-367-3p groups was significantly higher
anti-miR-367-3p
apoptotic ratios compared with anti-NC groups . Transwell
assays revealed that the migrating and invading cell
numbers in pre-miR-367-3p groups were significantly
diminished in pre-miR-367-3p groups, whereas
anti-miR-367-3p groups exhibited higher numbers
compared with anti-NC groups (Migration analysis,
U87 cells: P=0.0017; U251 cells: P=0.0022.Invasion
analysis, U87 cells: P=0.0023; U251 cells: P=0.0025)
(Figure 2J).

We subsequently studied the effect of PIWIL3,
piR-30188, and OIP5-AS1 on the level of
miR-367-3p
U87 and U251 cells were transfected with
piR-30188,
respectively,
cotransfected with PIWIL3, piR-30188, and OIP5-AS1.
miR-367-3p expression in each group was quantified
PIWIL3(+),
pre-piR-30188, and sh-OIP5-AS1 groups exhibited
miR-367-3p
expression
PIWIL3(+)-NC,
respectively. The effect was magnified in the
PIWIL3(+)+pre-piR-30188+sh-OIP5-AS1 groups. In
most cases, lncRNA and miRNA reciprocally regulate
each other’s expression. Therefore, we hypothesized
that miR-367-3p exhibits a negative regulatory effect
on OIP5-AS1. To confirm our prediction, U87 and
transiently
transfected
miR-367-3p. OIP5-AS1 expression was analyzed with
qRT-PCR. As shown in Figure 3B, OIP5-AS1 level in
the pre-miR-367-3p group was significantly lower
than that of the pre-NC group, whereas the
anti-miR-367-3p groups exhibited higher expression
than the anti-NC groups (U87 cells: P=0.0016; U251
P=0.0031).

miR-367-3p binding site (Figure 3C). A dual-luciferase
reporter assay was conducted to determine the
binding site of OIP5-AS1 and miR-367-3p. The
luciferase activity in the OIP5-AS1-Wt+pre-miR-367-
3p group was significantly reduced compared to that
in the control group, whereas the luciferase activities
in the OIP5-AS1-Mut groups were not affected
(P=0.0019) (Figure 3D). Also, RIP results proved that
OIP5-AS1 could impair miR-367-3p expression in a
sequence-dependent manner (Figure 3E and F).
Molecular networks involving PIWIL3,
piR-30188, miR-367-3p, and OIP5-AS1 and
their downstream targets CEBPA and TRAF4
We conducted Western blotting to explore the
piR-30188,
miR-367-3p on the expression of CEBPA and TRAF4.
Glioma cell lines U87 and U251 cells were stably
transfected with PIWIL3, piR-30188, and OIP5-AS1 or
cotransfected with PIWIL3, piR-30188 and OIP5-AS1.
Reduced expression of CEBPA and TRAF4 was
observed in PIWIL3(+), pre-piR-30188, and sh-OIP5-
AS1 groups compared with PIWIL3(+)-NC, pre-NC
and sh-NC groups, respectively. The suppressive
effect was magnified in the PIWIL3(+)+pre-piR-
30188+sh-OIP5-AS1 groups (Figure 3G and H). We
then transiently transfected U87 and U251 cells with
miR-367-3p. CEBPA mRNA expression was assessed
by qRT-PCR and was found to be significantly
reduced in the pre-miR-367-3p group compared with
the pre-NC group. In contrast, the anti-miR-367-3p
groups exhibited significantly higher expression than
the anti-NC groups (for U87 cells: P=0.0020; for U251
cells: P=0.0016) (Figure 3I). Western blotting indicated
decreased expression of CEBPA and TRAF4 in the
pre-miR-367-3p groups than in the pre-NC groups,
whereas the anti-miR-367-3p groups revealed higher
expression than the anti-NC groups (Figure 3J and K).
By searching the bioinformatics database Targetscan,
we noticed that the 3’UTR region of CEBPA might
harbor one miR-367-3p binding site (Figure 3L). We
therefore performed the dual-luciferase reporter
assay. As shown in Figure 3M, the luciferase activity
was significantly decreased in the CEBPA-Wt+pre-
miR-367-3p group compared with that of the
CEBPA-Wt+pre-NC group, whereas the luciferase
activity of the CEBPA-Mut group was not affected
(P=0.0021). Western blot analysis also proved that
CEBPA was significantly up-regulated in glioma
tissues compared with normal brain tissues and was
positively correlated with the pathological grade of
glioma. CEBPA also exhibited high expression levels
in U87 and U251 cells compared with normal human
astrocytes (Figure 4A and B).
Knockdown of OIP5-AS1 combined with
over-expression of miR-367-3p decreased
CEBPA and TRAF4 expression and inhibited
glioma cells growth
To investigate whether miR-367-3p intensified
the tumor-suppressive effect of OIP5-AS1 knockdown, we transfected OIP5-AS1-silenced U87 and
U251 cells with miR-367-3p. As shown in Figure 4C,
sh-OIP5-AS1+pre-miR-367-3p groups exhibited lower
levels of CEBPA and TRAF4 expression compared
with sh-NC+pre-NC groups, whereas there was no
significant difference between sh-NC+anti-NC and
sh-OIP5-AS1+anti-miR-367-3p groups (Figure 4C and
D). Cell proliferation in sh-OIP5-AS1+pre-miR-
367-3p groups was attenuated compared with sh-NC+
pre-NC groups, while sh-OIP5-AS1+anti-miR-367-3p
groups showed no significant difference from
sh-NC+anti-NC groups (U87 cells: P=0.0015; U251
cells: P=0.0016) (Figure 4E). Flow cytometry analysis
demonstrated that the apoptotic ratios in sh-OIP5-
AS1+pre-miR-367-3p groups were higher compared
sh-NC+pre-NC
AS1+anti-miR-367-3p groups showed no significant
difference from sh-NC+anti-NC groups (U87 cells:
P=0.0013; U251 cells: P=0.0016) (Figure 4F). Transwell
assays were conducted to assess the migrating and
invading cell numbers. The numbers in sh-OIP5-

TRAF4 was a target of CEBPA and knockdown
of CEBPA restrained malignant growth of
Western blot analysis demonstrated a positive
correlation of TRAF4 expression with pathological
grade of glioma. TRAF4 was up-regulated in glioma
tissues compared with normal brain tissues and also
exhibited high expression in U87 and U251 cells
compared with normal human astrocytes (P=0.0015,
P=0.0025, respectively) (Figure 5A and B). U87 and
U251 cells with CEBPA knockdown were established
and qRT-PCR was used to assess the expression level
of TRAF4 mRNA. As shown in Figure 5C, TRAF4
mRNA expression was attenuated in sh-CEBPA
groups compared with sh-NC groups (P=0.0024,
P=0.0017, respectively) and TRAF4 expression, as
confirmed by Western blotting, was decreased
(P=0.0028, P=0.0013, respectively) (Figure 5D). By
using the bioinformatics software JASPAR, we
predicted that the TRAF4 promoter might harbor two
upstream putative binding sites for CEBPA. ChIP
assays were performed to verify the putative
correlation between TRAF4 promoter and CEBPA.
The 3000 bp upstream region of the putative CEBPA
binding site was amplified by PCR and used as a
negative control. There was a direct association of
CEBPA with the putative binding site1 of TRAF4
(Figure 5E), but there were no interactions of CEBPA
with the negative control or putative binding site 2.
CCK-8 assays revealed cell proliferation in sh-CEBPA
groups was significantly suppressed in contrast to
sh-NC groups (U87 cells: P=0.0023; U251 cells:
P=0.0018) (Figure 5F). Flow cytometry analysis
demonstrated that the apoptotic ratio of sh-CEBPA
groups was higher compared with that of sh-NC
groups (U87 cells: P=0.0017; U251 cells: P=0.0015)
(Figure 5G). Transwell assays showed sh-CEBPA
groups had lower numbers of migration and invasion
in contrast to sh-NC groups (Figure 5H).
Over-expression of miR-367-3p inhibited
CEBPA-induced malignant growth of glioma
and promoted apoptosis by targeting CEBPA
To investigate whether CEBPA could reverse the

biological behavior in glioma, we assessed the effect
of expression of TRAF4 on cell proliferation,
apoptosis, migration, and invasion in U87 and U251

(non-3’UTR). Western blot analysis of TRAF4
expression is illustrated in Figure 6A. TRAF4 was

cytometry analysis showed increased apoptotic ratios
(Figure 6C) and Transwell assays revealed increased
numbers of migrating and invading cells in
miR-367-3p+CEBPA (non-3’UTR) groups compared
to miR-367-3p+CEBPA-NC and miR-367-3p+CEBPA
groups (Figure 6D).
TRAF4 exerted oncogenic function in glioma
cells, and PIWIL3 was a target of CEBPA
proliferation in TRAF4-knocked down U87 and U251
cells. As shown in Figure 7A and 7B, respectively,
sh-TRAF4 groups showed decreased proliferation
(U87 cells: P=0.0021; U251 cells: P=0.0036) and
increased apoptotic ratios by flow cytometry (U87
cells: P=0.0050; U251 cells: P=0.0053) compared
decreased numbers of migrating and invading cells in
sh-TRAF4 groups compared with sh-NC groups
(Figure 7C).The bioinformatics software JASPAR
predicted the putative binding sites in PIWIL3 for
CEBPA. We established U87 and U251 cells with
knocked-down of CEBPA and showed attenuation of
PIWIL3 mRNA expression by qRT-PCR (Figure 7D)
and protein expression by Western blotting (Figure
7E) in sh-CEBPA groups compared with sh-NC
groups (U87 cells: P=0.0026; U251 cells: P=0.0028).
ChIP assays were performed to verify the putative
correlation between thePIWIL3 promoter and CEBPA.
The 3000 bp upstream region of the putative CEBPA
binding, which was not expected to associate with
CEBPA, was amplified using PCR and used as a
negative control. There was a direct association of
CEBPA with putative binding sites1 and 2 of PIWIL3
(Figure 7F), but there were no interactions of CEBPA
with the control region or putative binding sites3 and
4. These results suggested CEBPA and PIWIL3 may
form a reciprocal feedback loop.
Knockdown of OIP5-AS1 combined with
over-expression of PIWIL3 and miR-367-3p
restrained tumor growth and prolonged nude
mice survival
The in vivo results are illustrated in Figure 8A. In
contrast to control groups, PIWIL3(+), OIP5-AS1(-)
and miR-367-3p(+) groups produced smaller tumor
volumes(U87
respectively; U251 cells: P=0.015, P=0.024, P=0.021,
respectively). Also, PIWIL3(+)+OIP5-AS(-)+miR-367-
3p(+) groups produced smaller tumors than their
respective controls, PIWIL3(+), OIP5-AS1(-) and
miR-367-3p(+) groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was

PIWIL3(+)+OIP5-AS1(-)+miR-367-3p(+)

piR-30188, and miR-367-3p are expressed at low levels
in glioma tissues and are negatively correlated with

over-expression as well as the OIP5-AS1 knockdown
and their combined application attenuated glioma
cells progression by up-regulating miR-367-3p.
CEBPA and TRAF4 expression was up-regulated in
glioma tissues and cells and was positively correlated
with the pathological grade of glioma. Knockdown of
CEBPA and TRAF4 significantly attenuated glioma
cells malignant growth and CEBPA knockdown
reduced TRAF4 mRNA expression. Over-expression
of miR-367-3p decreased CEBPA and its mRNA
expression, whereas knockdown of miR-367-3p

Dual-luciferase assays showed that miR-367-3p
specifically bound to the 3’UTR of CEBPA mRNA.
CHIP assays revealed binding of CEBPA to the
over-expression as well as the OIP5-AS1 knockdown
and their combined application inhibited CEBPA and
TRAF4 expression. In vivo studies suggested that
over-expression of PIWIL3 and miR-367-3p together
with OIP5-AS1 knockdown produced the smallest
xenograft volume in contrast to their respective single
application, contributing to the longest survival.
Recently, the PIWI protein family has been the
subject of intense studies. The expression of PIWIL
proteins varies in different tumors and, as reported
recently, PIWIL1, PIWIL2, and PIWIL4 are expressed
at low levels in human renal cell carcinoma and are
related to shortened survival . PIWIL2 has weak
cytoplasmic but no nuclear expression and is
associated with the progression of bladder cancer,
suggesting it acts as a tumor suppressor .
However, PIWIL2 is up-regulated in colorectal
tumors and is positively correlated with poor
prognosis, indicating it acts as an oncogene .
PIWIL3 expression is closely related to survival and
recurrence of breast cancer . It is highly expressed
in the primary site and metastatic lymph nodes of
human stage III epithelial ovarian cancer . Our
study demonstrated that expression of PIWIL3 was
decreased in glioma tissues and cells, whereas its
over-expression attenuated the malignant behavior of
glioma cells. These results indicate the complexity and
diversity of PIWIL3 functions in various cancers. Our
study proved, for the first time, that piR-30188
expression was decreased in U87 and U251 glioma
cells and negatively correlated with the pathological
grade of glioma. Over-expression of piR-30188
inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of
glioma cells, simultaneously promoting apoptosis.
However, there are no reports providing mechanistic
insights into the role of piR-30188 in tumors.
So far, piRNAs have been found to correlate with
various malignancies. PiR-651 is highly expressed in
prostate and breast cancer cells whereas PiR-823
has decreased expression in renal cell carcinoma and
is correlated with poor prognosis . Genome-wide
association as well as functional studies showed that
piR-598 containing the variant allele at rs147061479
promoted glioma growth and increased its risk .
piRNAs regulate cell functions via forming piRNA
complexes with PIWI proteins from the Argonaute
family and silencing their downstream genes .
Our study confirmed that piR-30188 bound to
PIWIL3. Combined over-expression of PIWIL3 and
piR-30188 contributed to the attenuation of the
proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioma cells
while promoting apoptosis, suggesting that piR-30188
was involved in PIWIL3’s regulation of the biological
behavior of glioma cells.
lncRNAs are involved in the genesis and
progression of various tumors. We have previously
reported that CRNDE and TUG1 exert regulatory
effects on the biological behavior of glioma cells as
ceRNAs . The current study confirmed the
up-regulation of OIP5-AS1 in glioma tissues and its
positive correlation with the pathological grade of
glioma. OIP5-AS1, whose knockdown inhibited the
malignant progression of glioma cells, was highly
expressed in U87 and U251 cells. These results
demonstrated that OIP5-AS1 acts as an oncogenic
factor in glioma tissues and cells. Our results have
further illustrated that over-expression of PIWIL3 and
piR-30188, individual or combined, significantly
suppressed OIP5-AS1 expression. This indicated that
piR-30188 bound to PIWIL3 exerted an inhibitory
effect on OIP5-AS1. Dual luciferase assays further
confirmed the binding site between piR-30188 and
OIP5-AS1. PIWIL3 and piR-30188 over-expression as
well as OIP5-AS1 knockdown and their combined
application reduced the malignant progression of
glioma cells. Moreover, the combined application
suggesting

combination of PIWIL3, piR-30188, and OIP5-AS1
played a key role in regulating the malignant behavior
of glioma cells.
miR-367-3p, a member of the miR-302/367
cluster, was expressed at a low level in glioma tissues
as well as U87 and U251 cells and was negatively
correlated with the pathological grade of glioma.
