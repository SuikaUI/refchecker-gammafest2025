Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) can monitor spatiotemporal distribution of radiotracer in vivo. The spatiotemporal information can be used to estimate parametric images of
radiotracer kinetics that are of physiological and biochemical interests. Direct estimation of
parametric images from raw projection data allows accurate noise modeling and has been shown
to offer better image quality than conventional indirect methods, which reconstruct a sequence of
PET images first and then perform tracer kinetic modeling pixel-by-pixel. Direct reconstruction of
parametric images has gained increasing interests with the advances in computing hardware. Many
direct reconstruction algorithms have been developed for different kinetic models. In this paper
we review the recent progress in the development of direct reconstruction algorithms for parametric image estimation. Algorithms for linear and nonlinear kinetic models are described and
their properties are discussed.

1 Introduction
1.1 Parametric Imaging with Dynamic PET
Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET)
provides the additional temporal information of tracer kinetics compared to static PET. It has been shown
that tracer kinetics can be useful in tumor diagnosis
such as differentiation between malignant and benign
lesions , and in therapy monitoring where the
kinetic values from dynamic PET can be more predictive for assessment of response than the standard uptake value at a single time point .
There are basically two approaches for deriving
region-of-interest (ROI) kinetic modeling and parametric imaging . The ROI based approach fits a kinetic model to the average time activity curve (TAC)
of a selected ROI, so it is easy to implement and has
low computation cost. In contrast, parametric imaging
estimates kinetic parameters for every pixel and provides the spatial distribution of kinetic parameters. It
is thus more suitable to study heterogeneous tracer
uptake in tissue. Parametric images have been found
useful in many biological research and clinical diagnosis . However, parametric imaging is more
demanding computationally and more sensitive to
noise in dynamic PET data than the ROI-based kinetic
modeling. Obtaining parametric images of high quality therefore raises new challenges that were not faced
by conventional ROI-based methods .
1.2 Direct Reconstruction of Parametric Images
The typical procedure of parametric imaging is
to reconstruct a sequence of emission images from the
measured PET projection data first, and then to fit the
TAC at each pixel to a linear or nonlinear kinetic
model. To obtain an efficient estimate, the noise distribution of the reconstructed activity images should

be modeled in the kinetic analysis. However, exact
modeling of the noise distribution in PET images can
be difficult because noise is spatially variant and object-dependent. Usually the spatial variation and correlations between pixels are simply ignored in the
kinetic fitting step, which can lead to very noisy results.
Direct reconstruction has been developed to reduce noise amplification in parametric imaging. Direct reconstruction methods combine tracer kinetic
modeling and emission image reconstruction into a
single formula to estimate parametric images directly
from the raw projection data . Because PET
projection data are well-modeled as independent
Poisson random variables, direct reconstruction allows accurate compensation of noise propagation
from sinogram measurements to the kinetic fitting
process. It has been shown that images reconstructed
by direct reconstruction methods have better bias-variance characteristics than those obtained by
indirect methods for both linear models and
nonlinear kinetic models .
One drawback of direct reconstruction of parametric images is that the optimization algorithms are
more complex than indirect methods , due to
the intertwinement of the temporal and spatial correlations. In addition, when compartment models are
used, the relationship between the kinetic parameters
and PET data also becomes nonlinear. Therefore, the
development of efficient optimization algorithms for
direct reconstruction is of high significance.
1.3 A Brief History of Direct Reconstruction
The theory of direct reconstruction of parametric
images was developed right after the publication of
likelihood
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for static PET reconstruction . In 1984, Snyder presented an
ML EM algorithm to estimate compartmental parameters from time-of-flight list-mode data. Carson and
Lange in 1985 presented an EM algorithm for
maximum likelihood reconstruction of kinetic parameters from PET projection data. However, neither
of these algorithms was validated using a realistic
simulation or real data at the time, possibly due to the
limitation of computing hardware.
In 1995, Limber et al combined a least
reconstruction
Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm to estimate the
parameters of a single exponential decay model from
SPECT projection data. Separable nonlinear least
squares were used by Huesman et al in 1998 to
estimate kinetic parameters of a one-tissue compartment model from 3D SPECT projection data. To reduce computation cost, several researchers also developed methods for direct estimation of kinetic parameters for ROIs instead of reconstruction of the
whole parametric images, e.g. . These algorithms are only efficient for a small-scale problem
with a limited number of ROIs. When the number of
unknown parameters goes beyond a few hundreds,
both the LM algorithm used by Limber et al and
the separable nonlinear least squares used by Huesman et al become inefficient.
The development of algorithms that are suitable
for large-scale direct estimation began to attract more
and more attention with the recent advances in computing technology. In 2005, a parametric iterative coordinate descent (PICD) algorithm was proposed by
Kamasak et al for penalized likelihood estimation
of parametric images of a two-tissue compartment
model. To our knowledge, this was the first demonstration of direct parametric reconstruction on a dense
set of voxels. Yan et al proposed a new EM algorithm for direct ML reconstruction of kinetic parameters of a one-tissue compartment model. Both Kamasak’s PICD and Yan’s EM algorithms are specific to
their respective compartment models. To simplify
practical implementation, Wang and Qi in 2008 proposed generalized optimization transfer algorithms
for direct penalized likelihood reconstruction of
parametric images that are applicable to a wide variety of kinetic models . The algorithms resemble
the empirical iterative implementation of the indirect
method that alternates between an image reconstruction update and kinetic fitting step (e.g., ), but
have the advantage of guaranteed monotonic convergence to the direct estimate. Later Wang and Qi
 also proposed an EM-based optimization
transfer algorithm for direct penalized likelihood reconstruction that has faster convergence rate, especially at situations with low background events (randoms and scatters).
Direct reconstruction of parametric images for
linear kinetic models has also been developed due to
its computational efficiency. In 1997, Matthews et al
 used the ML EM algorithm to estimate the parametric images of a set of linear temporal basis functions. Meikle et al in 1998 presented a direct reconstruction for the spectral analysis model using the
non-negative least squares method. Mathematically,
direct reconstruction of linear parametric images is
essentially the same as dynamic image reconstruction
with overlapping temporal basis functions, such as
B-splines . To avoid pre-defined basis functions,
Reader et al also proposed a method to estimate the
linear coefficients and temporal basis functions simultaneously . To obtain physiologically relevant
kinetic parameters directly, Patlak model has been
incorporated into direct reconstruction by defining
Theranostics 2013, Vol. 3, Issue 10
 
two temporal basis functions as the blood input function and its integral . In 2007, Wang et al presented a maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction
of the Patlak parameters using a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm. Tsoumpas et al 
presented an ML EM algorithm for direct Patlak reconstruction. Li and Leahy , and Zhu et al 
developed direct reconstruction of the Patlak parameters from list-mode data. Tang et al used anatomical prior information to improve the Patlak reconstruction. Rahmim et al used the AB-EM algorithm
 to allow negative values in the direct estimation
for a Patlak-like graphical analysis model . It has
been observed that the strong correlation between the
two temporal basis functions in the Patlak model
slows down the convergence speed of the direct reconstruction. A nested EM algorithm was developed
by Wang and Qi to improve the convergence rate
of direct linear parametric reconstruction.
1.4 Aim of This Paper
In this paper we will provide an overview of the
recent progress in the development of direct reconstruction algorithms. We will describe technical details of different algorithms and analyze their properties. Methods for direct reconstruction of linear and
nonlinear parametric images as well as for joint estimation of parametric images and input function will
be included. We expect the information in this review
will provide useful guidance to readers for choosing a
proper direct reconstruction method.
2 General Formulation of Direct Reconstruction
2.1 PET Data Model
A dynamic PET scan is often divided into multiple consecutive time frames, with each frame containing coincidence events recorded from the start of
the frame till the end of the frame. The image intensity
at pixel 𝑗 in time frame m, 𝑥𝑚(𝜽𝑗), is then given by
𝐶T(𝜏; 𝜽𝑗)𝑒−𝜆𝑡𝑑𝜏
where 𝑡𝑚,𝑠 and 𝑡𝑚,𝑒 denote the start and end times of
frame 𝑚, respectively, and 𝜆 is the decay constant of
the radiotracer. 𝐶T൫𝑡; 𝜽𝑗൯ is the tracer concentration in
pixel 𝑗 at time 𝑡 and is determined by a linear or nonlinear kinetic model with the parameter vector
𝜽𝑗∈ℝ𝑛𝑘×1. 𝑛𝑘 is the total number of kinetic parameters for each pixel.
measurements
{𝑌𝑖𝑚, 𝑖= 1 ∙∙∙
, 𝑛𝑖, 𝑚= 1 ∙∙∙, 𝑛𝑚} can be well modeled as a collection
of independent Poisson random variables ,
𝑌𝑖𝑚∼Poisson൛𝑦ത𝑖𝑚(𝜽)ൟ …(2)
where 𝑖 and 𝑚 are the indices of detector pairs and
time frames, respectively, and 𝑛𝑖 and 𝑛𝑚 are the total
numbers of the detector pairs and of the time frames,
respectively. The expected projection {𝑦ത𝑖𝑚(𝜽)} is related to the dynamic image {𝑥̅𝑖𝑚(𝜽)}, through an affine
transform,
𝑦ത𝑖𝑚(𝜽) = 𝑙𝑖𝑚(𝜽) + 𝑟𝑖𝑚 …(3)
𝑙𝑖𝑚(𝜽) = ∑
where 𝑝𝑖𝑗, the (𝑖. 𝑗)th element of the system matrix
𝑷∈ℝ𝑛𝑖×𝑛𝑗, is the probability of detecting an event
originated in pixel 𝑗 by detector pair 𝑖, and 𝑟𝑖𝑚 is the
expectation of scattered and random events at detector pair 𝑖 in the 𝑚th frame. 𝑛𝑗 is the total number of
image pixels.
Let 𝒚ത𝑚(𝜽) ≡{𝑦ത𝑖𝑚(𝜽)}𝑖=1
𝑛𝑖 and 𝒓𝑚≡{𝑟𝑖𝑚}𝑖=1
projection vectors and 𝒙𝑚(𝜽) ≡{𝑥𝑚(𝜽𝑗)}𝑗=1
𝑛𝑗 the image
vector in frame 𝑚. The forward model for time frame
𝑚 can be rewritten in a matrix-vector product form:
𝒚ത𝑚(𝜽) = 𝑷𝒙𝑚(𝜽) + 𝒓𝑚 …(5)
Let us define a matrix of kinetic parameters,
𝚯≡[𝜽1,∙∙∙, 𝜽𝑛𝒋]𝑇, in which each column represents an
image of a kinetic parameter. We use 𝚯 to denote its
ordered vector. Similarly we also define the following
𝑿(𝚯) = ൣ𝒙1(𝜽),∙∙∙, 𝒙𝑛𝑚(𝜽)൧
𝒀ത(𝚯) = ቂ𝒚ത1(𝜽),∙∙∙, 𝒚ത𝑛𝑚(𝜽)ቃ
𝑹= ൣ𝒓1,∙∙∙, 𝒓𝑛𝑚൧
𝒙(𝜽), 𝒚ഥ(𝜽) and 𝒓 respectively. Then the expectation of
the whole dynamic PET data can be expressed either
𝒀ത(𝚯) = 𝑷𝑿(𝚯) + 𝑹 …(6)
𝒚ത(𝜽) = ൫𝑰𝑛𝑚⨂𝑷൯𝒙(𝜽) + 𝒓 …(7)
where 𝑰𝑁 is a 𝑁× 𝑁 identity matrix and ⨂ denotes the
Kronecker product. Equation (6) is the form for practical implementation and equation (7) is more suitable
for algorithm analysis.
2.2 Maximum Likelihood Reconstruction
The goal of direct reconstruction is to estimate 𝜽
from dynamic PET measurements. Let 𝑦𝑖𝑚 denote a
set of dynamic PET measurements. 𝒀 and 𝒚 are the
Theranostics 2013, Vol. 3, Issue 10
 
matrix and the vector that are formed by {𝑦𝑖𝑚} in the
same fashion as 𝒀ഥ and 𝒚ത, respectively. The log Poisson
likelihood function of the dynamic PET data is
𝐿(𝒚|𝜽) = ∑
𝑦𝑖𝑚log 𝑦ത𝑖𝑚(𝜽) −𝑦ത𝑖𝑚(𝜽)
ℎ𝑖𝑚൫𝑙𝑖𝑚(𝜽)൯
where a constant term is neglected and ℎ𝑖𝑚(𝑙) is defined by
ℎ𝑖𝑚(𝑙) = 𝑦𝑖𝑚log(𝑙+ 𝑟𝑖𝑚) −(𝑙+ 𝑟𝑖𝑚) …(10)
Maximum likelihood (ML) reconstruction finds
the solution by maximizing the log likelihood function,
𝜽ො= argmax𝜽∈𝒮𝐿(𝒚|𝜽) …(11)
where 𝒮 denotes the feasible set of the kinetic parameters 𝜽 (e.g. satisfying nonnegativity or box constraints). The resulting images from ML reconstruction at convergence are often very noisy because the
tomography problem is ill-conditioned. In practice,
the true ML solution is seldom being sought. Rather
images are regularized either by early termination
before convergence or using a penalty function or
image prior to encourage spatial smoothness.
2.3 Penalized Likelihood Reconstruction
Penalized likelihood (PL) reconstruction (or
equivalently maximum a posteriori, MAP) regularizes
the solution by incorporating a roughness penalty in
the objective function to encourage spatially smooth
images. PL reconstruction finds the parametric image
that maximizes the penalized likelihood function as
𝜽ො= argmax𝜽∈𝒮Φ(𝜽), Φ(𝜽) = 𝐿(𝒚|𝜽) −𝛽𝑉(𝜽)
where 𝑉(𝜽) is a smoothness penalty and 𝛽 is the regularization parameter that controls the tradeoff between the resolution and noise. If 𝛽 is too small, the
reconstructed image approaches the ML estimate and
becomes very noisy; if 𝛽 is too large, the reconstructed
image becomes very smooth and useful information
can be lost.
The smoothness penalty can be applied either on
the kinetic parameters 𝜽 or on the dynamic image
{𝒙𝑚(𝜽)}𝑚=1
𝑛𝑚, depending on the application. A penalty
applied on the dynamic images can be expressed by
where 𝑈(𝝁) is a smoothness penalty given by
𝛾𝑗𝑘𝜓(𝜇𝑗−𝜇𝑘)
and 𝜓(𝑡) is the potential function. 𝒩𝑗 denotes the
neighborhood of pixel 𝑗; 𝛾𝑗𝑘 is the weighting factor
equal to the inverse distance between pixels 𝑗 and 𝑘.
A typical neighborhood includes the eight nearest
pixels in 2D and 26 nearest voxels in 3D.
The basic requirement of 𝜓(𝑡) is that it is even
and non-decreasing of |𝑡|. A common choice in PET
image reconstruction is the quadratic function
2 𝑡2 . The disadvantage of the quadratic
regularization is that it can over-smooth edges and
small objects when a large 𝛽 is used. To preserve
edges, non-quadratic penalty functions can be used.
Examples includes the absolute value function
𝜓(𝑡) = |𝑡|
𝜓(𝑡) = |𝑡| −
𝛿) , and other variations . Nonconvex penalty functions can also be used to even
enhance edges, but they are much less popular because the resulting objective function may have multiple local optima.
3 Reconstruction of Parametric Images
for Linear Kinetic Models
3.1 Linear Kinetic Models
One way to represent time activity curves is to
use a set of linear temporal basis functions. The tracer
concentration 𝐶T(𝑡; 𝝓) at time t can be described by,
𝐶T(𝑡; 𝝓) = ∑
where 𝑛𝑘 is the total number of basis functions, 𝐵𝑘(𝑡)
is the 𝑘th temporal basis function and 𝜙𝑘 is the coefficient to be estimated.
The temporal basis functions can be divided into
two categories. The first category primarily focuses on
efficient representation of time activity curves. Examples include B-splines and wavelets , as
well as those obtained from principal component
analysis or adaptively estimated from PET data
 . One advantage of these basis functions is that
they can represent a wide variety of time activity
curves. A disadvantage is that the associated coefficients are not directly related to the kinetic parameters
of physiological interest. Kinetic modeling is often
required to estimate kinetic parameters from the
TACs after reconstruction. In comparison, the second
category to be described below provides linear coefficients that are directly related to the kinetic parameters of interest.
3.1.1 Spectral Analysis
In spectral analysis the basis functions are a set
of pre-determined exponential functions convolved
with the blood input function 𝐶p(𝑡) ,
𝐵𝑘(𝑡) = 𝜈𝑘𝑒−𝜈𝑘𝑡∗𝐶p(𝑡) …(16)
where 𝜈𝑘 denotes the rate constant of the 𝑘th spectrum and ‘∗’ represents the convolution operator. The
Theranostics 2013, Vol. 3, Issue 10
 
exponential spectral bases are consistent with the
compartmental models and the distribution volume
(DV) of a reversible tracer can be directly computed
from the spectral coefficients {𝜙𝑘} by
If the blood input function 𝐶p(𝑡) in (16) is replaced by a reference region TAC 𝐶r(𝑡), the calculated
quantity from the spectral coefficients then becomes
the distribution volume ratio (DVR), which is related
to binding potential (BP), a major parameter of interest in neuroreceptor studies, by
𝐵𝑃= 𝐷𝑉𝑅−1 = ∑
3.1.2 Patlak Model
The Patlak graphical method is a linear
technique which has been widely used in dynamic
PET data analysis. For a tracer with an irreversible
compartment, the time activity curve satisfies the following linear relationship at the steady state:
𝐶p(𝑡) = 𝐾𝑖
+ 𝑏, 𝑡> 𝑡∗ …(19)
where 𝑡∗ is the time for the tracer to reach steady state.
The Patlak slope 𝐾𝑖 represents the overall influx rate
of the tracer into the irreversible compartment and
has found applications in many disease studies. For
example, 𝐾𝑖 is proportional to the glucose metabolic
rate in FDG scans. In some applications, the plasma
input function 𝐶p(𝑡) can also be replaced by a reference region input function 𝐶r(𝑡).
Equation (19) can be rewritten into the following
linear model:
𝐶T(𝑡; 𝝓) = 𝐾𝑖𝐵1(𝑡) + 𝑏𝐵2(𝑡), 𝑡> 𝑡∗ …(20)
where 𝝓≡[𝐾𝑖, 𝑏]𝑇 and the two basis functions are
𝐵1(𝑡) = ∫𝐶p(𝜏)𝑑𝜏
𝐵2(𝑡) = 𝐶p(𝑡) …(22)
3.1.3 Logan Plot and Relative Equilibrium Plot
For reversible tracers, the Logan plot can be used
to estimate distribution volume or binding potential
 . The standard Logan plot equation is
+ 𝑏′, 𝑡> 𝑡∗ …(23)
However, the tissue activity curve 𝐶T(𝑡) is involved nonlinearly in the Logan plot (and also in the
multilinear model by Ichise et al ), which makes
direct reconstruction more difficult. Considering the
fact that the ratio between the tissue time activity
𝐶T(𝑡) and plasma concentration 𝐶p(𝑡) remains constant at relative equilibrium, Zhou et al proposed
replacing 𝐶T(𝑡) in the denominators by 𝐶p(𝑡). The
model is referred to as the relative equilibrium (RE)
model. After a slight rearrangement, we can write the
RE model in the following form:
∫𝐶T(𝜏)𝑑𝜏= 𝐷𝑉∫𝐶p(𝜏)𝑑𝜏+ 𝑏෤′𝐶p(𝑡), 𝑡> 𝑡∗
where the cumulative time activity ∫𝐶T(𝜏)𝑑𝜏
is expressed as a linear combination of the same two basis
functions as those in the Patlak plot.
To use the RE model, all the time frames should
start from 𝑡= 0 so that the reconstructed dynamic
images represent the cumulative time activity
. One consequence is that the projection
data in different frames are no longer independent, so
the likelihood function in (9) needs some modification
to obtain a true ML estimate. In addition, the intercept
𝑏෨′ in Eq. (24) is usually negative, which makes the
classic EM algorithm not applicable to the resulting
direct reconstruction.
Taking the derivative on both sides of (24), Zhou
et al presented an alternative form of the RE
𝐶T(𝑡) = 𝐷𝑉𝐶p(𝑡) + 𝑏෤′𝐶̇ p(𝑡), 𝑡> 𝑡∗ …(25)
where 𝐶̇ p(𝑡) is the first-order derivative of 𝐶p(𝑡). One
advantage of the modified RE model in (25) is that it
does not involve the cumulative time activity. In addition, since both 𝑏෨′ and 𝐶̇ p(𝑡) are negative, we can
rewrite (25) in positive terms
𝐶T(𝑡; 𝝓) = 𝐷𝑉𝐵1(𝑡) + ൫−𝑏෤′൯𝐵2(𝑡), 𝑡> 𝑡∗ …(26)
with 𝝓= ൣ𝐷𝑉, −𝑏෨′൧
𝑇 and the two basis functions
𝐵1(𝑡) = 𝐶p(𝑡) …(27)
𝐵2(𝑡) = −𝐶̇ p(𝑡) … (28)
The model equation (26) is now suitable for direct reconstruction using the classic EM algorithm
because the coefficient −𝑏෨′ and the basis function
𝐵2(𝑡) are both nonnegative when 𝑡> 𝑡∗. Note that
𝐶p(𝑡) can also be replaced by a reference region TAC
𝐶r(𝑡) to calculate DVR.
3.2 Forward Projection
With a linear kinetic model in (15), the dynamic
PET images can be expressed in a matrix-vector
𝑿𝑇= 𝑩𝚯𝑇 …(29)
or equivalently,
𝒙= ቀ𝑩⨂𝑰𝑛𝑗ቁ𝜽 …(30)
Theranostics 2013, Vol. 3, Issue 10
 
where the (𝑚, 𝑘)th element of the temporal basis matrix 𝑩∈ℝ𝑛𝑚×𝑛𝑘 is given by
𝐵𝑘(𝜏)𝑒−𝜆𝜏𝑑𝜏
Substituting the above equations into Eq. (6), we
get the following forward model for the linear kinetic
𝒀ത(𝚯) = 𝑷𝚯𝑩𝑇+ 𝑹 …(32)
or equivalently,
𝒚ത(𝜽) = (𝑩⨂𝑷)𝜽+ 𝒓 …(33)
3.3 Direct Reconstruction Using a Single
System Matrix
By treating 𝑩⨂𝑷 as a single system matrix
𝑨≡𝑩⨂𝑷, any existing algorithms for static PET reconstruction can be used for the direct estimation of
nonnegative linear parametric images. For example,
applying the ML EM algorithm , we get the
following update equation for direct linear parametric
image reconstruction :
𝑝𝑗𝑏𝑘∑∑𝑝𝑖𝑗𝐵𝑚𝑘
where the superscript 𝑛 denotes the 𝑛th iteration and
Similar to static PET reconstruction, the convergence of the parametric EM algorithm can be very
slow. Preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm and other accelerated algorithms can be
used to achieve a faster convergence. One example of
direct application of PCG to Patlak reconstruction can
be found in . When negative values are present in
the parametric images, such as those in the original
relative equilibrium model (24), the AB-EM algorithm
can be used .
One disadvantage of direct reconstruction using
a single system matrix is that the convergence can be
extremely slow when the temporal basis functions are
highly correlated as in the spectral analysis and Patlak
model . This is because the combination of the
temporal correlation and high spatial dimension results in an ill-posed problem that is much worse than
the static PET reconstruction. One way to solve this
problem is to decouple the spatial image update and
temporal parameter estimation at each iteration using
the nested EM algorithm described below.
3.4 Nested EM Algorithm
The nested EM algorithm at iteration (𝑛+ 1)
first calculates an intermediate dynamic image {𝑥ො𝑗𝑚
𝑦ത𝑖𝑚(𝜽𝑛) …(37)
and then updates the kinetic parameter estimate by
another EM-like equation
𝑦ത𝑖𝑚(𝜽𝑛) , 𝑙= 1, … , 𝑛𝑙 …(38)
𝑛,𝑛𝑙+1 , and 𝑙 is the
sub-iteration number in iteration (𝑛+ 1). Each full
iteration of the nested EM algorithm consists of one
iteration of EM-like emission image update (37) and
multiple iterations of kinetic parameter estimation
The nested EM algorithm was derived by using
the optimization transfer principle . A surrogate
function 𝑄em(𝜽; 𝜽𝑛) is constructed at each iteration,
𝑄em(𝜽; 𝜽𝑛) = ∑𝑝𝑗
𝑞em(𝜽𝑗; 𝒙ො𝑗
em,𝑛) …(39)
𝑞em൫𝜽𝑗; 𝒙ො𝑗
em,𝑛൯= ∑𝒙ො𝑗𝑚
log 𝑥𝑚൫𝜽𝑗൯−𝑥𝑚൫𝜽𝑗൯
where 𝑥ො𝑗𝑚
em,𝑛 is given by (37). This surrogate function
𝑄em(𝜽; 𝜽𝑛) −𝑄em(𝜽𝑛; 𝜽𝑛) ≤𝐿(𝒚|𝜽) −𝐿(𝒚|𝜽𝑛) …(41)
Then the maximization of the original likelihood
function 𝐿(𝒚|𝜽) is transferred into the maximization
of the surrogate function 𝑄em(𝜽; 𝜽𝑛) that can be
solved pixel-by-pixel,
𝑛+1 = argmax𝜽𝑗≥𝟎𝑞em(𝜽𝑗; 𝒙ො𝑗
em,𝑛) …(42)
Applying the EM algorithm to (42) results in the
update equation in (38). The property of the surrogate
function guarantees
𝐿(𝒚|𝜽𝑛+1) ≥𝐿(𝒚|𝜽𝑛) …(43)
and 𝜽𝑛 converges to the global solution.
It is easy to verify that the traditional EM algorithm in (34) is a special case of the nested EM algorithm with 𝑛𝑙= 1 . By running multiple iterations
of (38) with 𝑛𝑙> 1, the nested EM algorithm can substantially accelerate the convergence rate of the direct
reconstruction of linear parametric images without
affecting the overall computational time as the size of
matrix 𝑩 is much smaller than that of the system matrix 𝑷. This is clearly demonstrated by a toy example
shown in Fig. 1 . Starting from the same initial
image, the nested EM takes 6 iterations to converge to
the true solution, while the traditional EM requires
more than 60 iterations. The nested EM algorithm can
be further accelerated by considering the nested EM
algorithm as an implicit preconditioner and using
conjugate directions .

solution, while the traditional EM requires more than 60 iterations. Reprinted from with permission.
4 Reconstruction of Parametric Images
for Compartment Models
4.1 Compartment Modeling
While linear models are advantageous for computational efficiency, nonlinear kinetic models based
on compartment modeling are more related to the
well-developed biochemical kinetics . Under a
compartment model, the total tracer concentration in
𝐶T(𝑡; 𝝓) = (1 −𝑓v) ∑
𝑐𝑛(𝑡) + 𝑓v𝐶wb(𝑡)
where 𝑓v is the fractional volume of blood, 𝐶wb(𝑡)is
the whole blood concentration, and 𝑐𝑛(𝑡) represents
the concentration of the 𝑛th tissue compartment. The
compartment concentrations are related with each
other by a set of ordinary differential equations ,
𝑑𝑡𝒄(𝑡) = 𝑲𝒄(𝑡) + 𝑳𝒖(𝑡) …(45)
where 𝒄(𝑡) = [𝑐1(𝑡),∙∙∙, 𝑐𝑁(𝑡)]𝑇, 𝑲 and 𝑳 are the kinetic
parameter matrices that are formed by the rate constants in 𝝓, and 𝒖(𝑡) denotes the system input.
Taking the Laplace transform of (45), we get
𝑠𝒄ො(𝑠) = 𝑲𝒄ො(𝑠) + 𝑳𝒖ෝ(𝑠) …(46)
where 𝒄ො(𝑠) = ℒ[𝒄(𝑡)] and 𝒖ො(𝑠) = ℒ[𝒖(𝑡)] denote the
Laplace transforms of 𝒄(𝑡) and 𝒖(𝑡) , respectively.
Then solution of the differential equation (45) can be
obtained by
𝒄(𝑡) = ℒ−1[(𝑠𝑰𝑁−𝑲)−1𝑳𝒖ෝ(𝑠)] …(47)
where ℒ−1 denotes the inverse Laplace transform.
For the commonly used two-tissue compartment
model, we have
𝑲= ൬−(𝑘2 + 𝑘3)
−𝑘4൰, 𝒄(𝑡) = ቀ𝐶f(𝑡)
𝐶b(𝑡)ቁ …(48)
0 ൯, 𝒖(𝑡) = 𝐶p(𝑡) …(49)
with 𝝓= [𝑓v, 𝐾1, 𝑘2, 𝑘3, 𝑘4]𝑇, where 𝐾1, 𝑘2, 𝑘3, 𝑘4 are
the tracer rate constants, 𝐶f(𝑡) and 𝐶b(𝑡) are the concentrations in the free and bound compartments, and
𝐶p(𝑡) is the tracer concentration in plasma. The analytical solution of 𝒄(𝑡) is given by
−𝑘3 ൰ቆ𝑒−𝛼1𝑡∗𝐶p(𝑡)
𝑒−𝛼2𝑡∗𝐶p(𝑡)ቇ …(50)
where ∆𝛼= 𝛼2 −𝛼1 with 𝛼1,2 =
2 (𝑘2 + 𝑘3 + 𝑘4) ∓
2 [(𝑘2 + 𝑘3 + 𝑘4)2 −4𝑘2𝑘4]1/2 , and “*” denotes the
convolution operator.
4.2 Model-dependent Algorithms
4.2.1 PICD Algorithm
The parametric iterative coordinate descent
(PICD) algorithm was the first direct reconstruction algorithm implemented for a large-scale parametric reconstruction with a compartment model. It
first transforms the rate constants in the compartment
model into a set of auxiliary parameters and then estimates the auxiliary parameters directly from the
sinogram data. For example, the TAC in a
two-tissue-compartment model is rewritten as
𝐶T(𝑡; 𝝓) = ൫1 −𝑓v൯∑
∗𝐶p(𝑡) + 𝑓v𝐶wb(𝑡)
parameters
𝝓= [𝑓v, 𝜈1, 𝜈2, 𝛼1, 𝛼2]𝑇. Once the auxiliary parameters
are estimated, the kinetic rate constants can be calculated by
𝑘1 = 𝜈1 + 𝜈2 …(52)
𝜈1𝜈2(𝛼1−𝛼2)2
(𝜈1𝛼1+𝜈2𝛼2)(𝜈1+𝜈2) …(54)

To estimate the auxiliary parameters, a coordinate descent (CD) algorithm is used. The original
log-likelihood function is approximated by its second-order Taylor expansion. At each iteration, the
auxiliary parameters are updated by

The PICD algorithm uses an iterative gradient
descent algorithm to update the linear parameters in
𝜽𝑗 and an iterative golden section search to estimate
the nonlinear components. To accelerate the convergence rate and reduce computational cost, the PICD
algorithm updates the linear parameters more frequently than the nonlinear parameters.
The PICD algorithm is well suited for one- and
two-tissue-compartment models. For kinetic models
with more than two tissue compartments, however,
the parameter transformation becomes too complicated.
4.2.2 PMOLAR-1T Algorithm
The PMOLAR-1T algorithm is an EM algorithm for direct reconstruction of parametric images
for the one-tissue compartment model. It is derived by
introducing a new set of complete data that simultaneously decouples the pixel correlation as well as the
temporal convolution. Here we introduce it using the
optimization transfer framework.
First we note that the surrogate function in (40) is
applicable
one-tissue-compartment model, the tissue time activity curve can be described by
𝐶T(𝑡) = 𝜉(𝑡; 𝝓) ∗𝐶p(𝑡), 𝜉(𝑡; 𝝓) = 𝐾1𝑒−𝑘2𝑡 …(61)
and we have
𝑚′=1 ൫𝑡𝑚′; 𝜽𝑗൯𝑢𝑚,𝑚′
where 𝑢𝑚,𝑚′ ≜∆𝑡∫
𝐶p൫𝜏−𝑡𝑚′൯𝑒−𝜆𝜏𝑑𝜏
. Here we approximate the convolution integral using the summation over 𝑛𝑐 uniformly sampled time points with ∆𝑡
being the time interval.
Applying the EM surrogate function to (40) one
more time to decouple the temporal correlation, we
can find the maximum of (40) iteratively by
𝑢𝑚′ቀ𝜉̂𝑗,𝑚′
𝑛,𝑙log 𝜉(𝑡𝑚′; 𝜽𝑗ቁ−
𝜉(𝑡𝑚′; 𝜽𝑗))
𝑙= 1,∙∙∙, 𝑛𝑙
where 𝑢𝑚′ ≜∑
and 𝜉෠𝑗,𝑚′
𝑛,𝑙 is given by
For the one-tissue compartment model with
𝜽𝑗= ൣ𝐾1,𝑗, 𝑘2,𝑗൧
𝑇, the optimization in (63) has the following analytical solution:
𝑛,𝑙+1 = 𝐻−1 ቆ

𝐻(𝑘2) 
𝑡𝑚′𝑢𝑚′exp(−𝑘2𝑡𝑚′)
𝑢𝑚′exp(−𝑘2𝑡𝑚′)
and can be calculated by a look-up table.
The original PMOLAR-1T algorithm only
uses one subiteration with 𝑛𝑙= 1. Based on our experience with the nest EM algorithm for linear models,
we expect that the convergence rate of the
PMOLAR-1T algorithm can be accelerated by using
more than one subiterations (𝑛𝑙> 1).
4.3 Model-independent Algorithms
4.3.1 Iterative NLS Algorithms
Reader et al proposed an iterative nonlinear
least squares (NLS) algorithm for direct parametric
image reconstruction. It iteratively applies the NLS
kinetic fitting following an EM image update:
𝑛+1 = argmin𝜽𝑗∈𝒮
em,𝑛−𝑥𝑚(𝜽𝑗))2
where {𝑥ො𝑗𝑚
em,𝑛} is the dynamic image given in (37). The
weighting factor 𝑤𝑗𝑚
𝑛 has to be chosen empirically. In
 a uniform weight 𝑤𝑗𝑚
𝑛= 1 was used. Based on the
fact that (40) resembles a Poisson log-likelihood function, Matthews et al proposed the following
nonuniform weighting factor
Theranostics 2013, Vol. 3, Issue 10
 
which substantially improved performance over the
uniform weight.
However, neither the uniform nor the nonuniform weights provides any theoretical guarantee of
convergence because the quadratic function in (68) is
not a proper surrogate function. It has been observed
that the uniform weight can result in non-monotonic
changes in the likelihood function, although the results with the nonuniform weighting are reasonably
4.3.2 OT-SP Algorithm
To obtain a guaranteed convergence while
maintaining the simplicity of the iterative NLS algorithm, Wang and Qi proposed a quadratic surrogate function for the penalized likelihood function
using optimization transfer (OT). The surrogate function of the log-likelihood is derived based on the fact
that the second-order derivative of ℎ𝑖𝑚(𝑙) is a
non-decreasing function of 𝑙 and is bounded when
𝑟𝑖𝑚> 0. The potential function 𝜓(𝑡) in (14) also has a
bounded, non-increasing second-order derivative of
|𝑡|. Omitting the constants that are independent of 𝜽,
the surrogate function of the penalized likelihood is
𝑄(𝜽; 𝒛𝑛+1) = −∑
𝑛+1 −𝑙𝑖𝑚(𝜽)ቁ
(𝜽); 𝒙𝑚(𝜽𝑛)) …(70)
where the optimum curvature {𝜂𝑖𝑚
𝑛} is set to 
𝑙2 [ℎ𝑖𝑚(𝑙) −ℎ𝑖𝑚(0) −𝑙ℎ̇ 𝑖𝑚(𝑙)], 𝑙> 0
−ℎ̈ 𝑖𝑚(𝑙), 𝑙= 0
with 𝑙= 𝑙𝑖𝑚(𝜽𝑛) and 𝒛𝑛+1 ≡{𝑧𝑖𝑚
𝑛+1} is an intermediate
dynamic sinogram at iteration (𝑛+ 1),
𝑛+1 = 𝑙𝑖𝑚(𝜽𝑛) +
ℎ̇𝑖𝑚(𝑙𝑖𝑚(𝜽𝑛))
The second term in (70) is the surrogate function
for the penalty function and is given by
𝑈෥(𝝁; 𝝁𝑛) =
where 𝑤𝜓(𝑡) is the optimum curvature of the penalty
function 𝜓(𝑡)
For example 𝑤𝜓(𝑡) = 1 for the quadratic penalty
and 𝑤𝜓(𝑡) =
|𝑡|+𝛿 for the nonquadratic Lange penalty.
With 𝑟𝑖𝑚> 0, the surrogate 𝑄(𝜽; 𝒛𝑛+1) satisfies
the following condition:
𝑄(𝜽; 𝒛𝑛+1) −𝑄(𝜽𝑛; 𝒛𝑛+1) ≤Φ(𝜽) −Φ(𝜽𝑛) …(75)
Hence it minorizes the original objective function Φ(𝜽).
The optimization of the quadratic surrogate
function can be solved pixel-by-pixel in a coordinate
descent (CD) fashion . However, the OT-CD algorithm is difficult to parallelize because of the sequential update.
For simultaneous update, Wang and Qi further
developed an OT-SP (optimization transfer using
separable paraboloids) algorithm that uses separable paraboloids to decouple the correlations between pixels in 𝑄(𝜽; 𝒛𝑛+1) at each iteration. The overall surrogate function that minorizes the original objective function 𝛷(𝜽) at iteration n is
𝑄𝑠𝑝(𝜽; 𝜽𝑛) = −∑
sp,𝑛−𝑥𝑚൫𝜽𝑗൯ቁ
where the weighting factor {𝑤𝑗𝑚
𝑛} in the separable
least squares is
= ∑𝑝𝑖,𝑝𝑖𝑗𝜂𝑖𝑚
𝛾𝑗𝑘𝑤𝜓ቀ𝑥𝑚൫𝜽𝑗
with 𝑝𝑖= ∑𝑝𝑖𝑗
. The intermediate dynamic image
sp,𝑛} is given by
sp,𝑛= 𝑥𝑚൫𝜽𝑗
𝑛(𝜽𝑛) is the gradient of 𝛷(𝜽) with respect to
𝑛(𝜽𝑛) = − ∑𝑝𝑖𝑗ℎ̇ 𝑖𝑚൫𝑙𝑖𝑚(𝜽)൯−
𝛾𝑗𝑘𝜓̇ ൣ𝑥𝑚൫𝜽𝑗൯−𝑥𝑚(𝜽𝑘)൧
evaluated at 𝜽= 𝜽𝑛.
Because 𝑄𝑠𝑝(𝜽; 𝜽𝑛) is separable for pixels, maximization of 𝑄𝑠𝑝(𝜽; 𝜽𝑛) is reduced to a pixel-wise least
squares fitting optimization:
𝑛+1 = argmin𝜽𝑗∈𝒮
sp,𝑛−𝑥𝑚൫𝜽𝑗൯ቁ
which can be solved by any existing nonlinear least
squares methods (e.g. the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm).
In summary, each iteration of the OT-SP algorithm consists of two steps: an image update in (78)
and a NLS fitting in (80). It has the simplicity of the
iterative NLS algorithm, but guarantees a monotonic
convergence with Φ(𝜽𝑛+1 ≥Φ(𝜽𝑛). Compared to the
PICD and OT-CD algorithms, the OT-SP algorithm
can be easily parallelized. A disadvantage of the
OT-SP is that it requires the background {rim} to be
Theranostics 2013, Vol. 3, Issue 10
 
positive for the quadratic surrogate function to work,
so the convergence rate can be slow when the level of
background events is low.
4.3.3 OT-EM Algorithm
The OT-EM (optimization transfer using the EM
surrogate) was derived for direct reconstruction under low background levels . It combines the
EM surrogate function in (40) for the log-likelihood
function and a separable surrogate function for the
penalty function. The overall surrogate function is
𝑄(𝜽; 𝜽𝑛) = ∑
ቄ𝑝𝑗𝑞em൫𝜽𝑗; 𝒙ෝ𝑗
𝜓ൣ2𝑥𝑚൫𝜽𝑗൯−𝑥𝑚(𝜽𝑘
The optimization of the penalized likelihood
function Φ(𝜽) with respect to 𝜽 is transferred into the
maximization of the surrogate function 𝑄(𝜽; 𝜽𝑛) ,
which can be solved by the following small-scale pixel-wise optimization:
𝑛+1 = argmax𝜽𝑗∈𝒮𝑞em൫𝜽𝑗; 𝒙ො𝑗
𝜓ൣ2𝑥𝑚൫𝜽𝑗൯−𝑥𝑚(𝜽𝑘
A modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
was developed to solve this pixel-wise penalized
likelihood fitting in .
The OT-EM guarantees a monotonic increase in
the penalized likelihood Φ(𝜽𝑛+1) ≥Φ(𝜽𝑛) following
the optimization transfer properties of 𝑄(𝜽; 𝜽𝑛). It can
be much faster than the OT-SP algorithm when the
level of background events (scatters and randoms) is
5 Joint Reconstruction of Parametric Images and Input Function
In parametric image reconstruction, the blood
input function 𝐶p(𝑡) is required to be known a priori.
One standard method of measuring blood input is
arterial blood sampling, which is invasive and technically challenging. An alternative to arterial sampling is to derive the input function from a blood region or a reference region in a reconstructed image
 . When the region used for extraction of the input
function is of small size, the image-derived input
function (IDIF) can be less accurate due to partial
volume and other effects. Joint estimation of the input
function and parametric images can potentially improve the accuracy of the IDIF as well as the parametric images by fitting the input function and parametric image to the data simultaneously .
5.1 General Formulation
Given a set of kinetic parameters, the time activity curve 𝐶T(𝑡; 𝝓) is a linear function of the input
function u(t), which can be either the blood input
function 𝐶p(𝑡) or a reference tissue function 𝐶v(𝑡). Let
𝒗 denote the vector of parameters that defines the
input function 𝑢(𝑡) (e.g. the activity values at a set of
time points). Then the joint estimation can be formulated as
𝜽ො, 𝒗ො= argmax𝜽∈𝒮,𝒗∈𝒰Φ(𝜽, 𝒗) …(83)
where 𝒰 denotes the feasible set of 𝒗 and the penalized likelihood function Φ(𝜽) defined in (12) is rewritten here as an explicit function of 𝒗.
The maximization in (83) can be solved by an
alternating update algorithm (e.g. in )
𝜽𝑛+1 = argmax𝜽∈𝒮Φ(𝜽, 𝒗𝑛)
𝒗𝑛+1 = argmax𝒗∈𝒰Φ(𝜽𝑛+1, 𝒗) …(84)
5.2 Joint Estimation without an Input Region
One method for joint estimation without an input region was presented by Reader et al . The
algorithm was developed for the linear spectral analysis model. It uses the EM algorithm to find the ML
estimation of the input function and the linear coefficients from dynamic projection data. Here we introduce it using the optimization transfer principle and
describe how to extend it to nonlinear kinetic models.
We use the EM surrogate function in (40) for the
log-likelihood function Φ(𝜽, 𝒗). Here we rewrite it as
an explicit function of the input parameters 𝒗,
𝑄𝑛(𝜽, 𝒗) = ∑𝑝𝑗𝑞em
𝑛൫𝜽𝑗, 𝒗൯= ∑𝑥ො𝑗𝑚
em,𝑛log 𝑥𝑚൫𝜽𝑗, 𝒗൯−𝑥𝑚(𝜽𝑗, 𝒗)
where 𝑥ො𝑗𝑚
em,𝑛 is given by (37) and 𝑥𝑚(𝜽𝑗, 𝒗) is the same
as 𝑥𝑚(𝜽𝑗) but as an explicit function of 𝒗. Since
𝑄𝑛(𝜽, 𝒗) is separable for pixels when v is given, the
optimization (84) is transferred to
𝑛+1 = argmax𝜽𝑗∈𝒮𝑞em
𝑛(𝜽𝑗, 𝒗𝑛) …(87)
𝒗𝑛+1 = max𝒗∈𝒰𝑸𝑛(𝜽𝑛+1, 𝒗) …(88)
For a linear kinetic model, both above steps can
be solved by the EM algorithm with multiple
sub-iterations. When only one sub-iteration is used, it
is equivalent to the algorithm in .
For compartment models, the optimization in
(87) can be solved by the modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm given in . The update
of 𝒗 in (88) can still be solved by the EM algorithm.
Theranostics 2013, Vol. 3, Issue 10
 
5.3 Joint Estimation with an Input Region
One issue with the joint estimation without an input region is that there is an unknown scaling factor on 𝒗
and the linear coefficients in {𝜽𝑗} that cannot be determined. The problem can be solved if there is a region in the
image that contains purely the input function. Let 𝛤 denote such a region. Then the image intensity at pixel 𝑗∈𝛤
in time frame 𝑚 is
𝑥𝑚൫𝜽𝑗, 𝒗൯= ∫
𝑢(𝜏; 𝒗)𝑒−𝜆𝜏𝑑𝜏
, 𝑗∈𝛤 …(89)
The joint estimation then estimates the kinetic parameters at pixels outside 𝛤 and the time activity curve
inside 𝛤 simultaneously.
Using the same paraboloidal surrogate functions for the OT-SP algorithm, the following algorithm can be
obtained :
𝑛+1 = argmin𝜽∈𝒮∑𝑤𝑗𝑚
sp,𝑛−𝑥𝑚൫𝜽𝑗, 𝒗𝑛൯ቁ
𝒗𝑛+1 = argmin𝒗∈𝒰൛∑
sp,𝑛−𝑥𝑚(𝜽𝑗
sp,𝑛−𝑥𝑚(𝜽𝑛+1, 𝒗)]
where {𝜽𝑗} and 𝒗 are updated in an alternating fashion. 𝜽𝑗
𝑛+1 for 𝑗∉𝛤 is updated by the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm. The estimation of 𝒗 in ( (90) is a linear least squares problem that can be solved easily (e.g. by QR
decomposition).
6 Examples
Here we show some simulation results to demonstrate the advantage of direct reconstruction over indirect
reconstruction. We simulated a 60-minute 18F-FDG brain scan using a brain phantom that consisted of gray
matter, white matter and a small tumor inside the white matter. The time activity curve of each region was
generated using a two-tissue compartment model and an analytical blood input function. Figure 2 shows the 𝑘3
images reconstructed by an indirect method and the OT-EM algorithm and Figure 3 shows the corresponding 𝐾𝑖
images. Clearly the direct reconstruction results have much less noise than the indirect reconstruction results
while maintaining the same spatial resolution. The improvement is similar to those observed in other studies for
both linear and compartment models .

7 Conclusion
We have provided an overview of direct estimation algorithms for parametric image reconstruction
from dynamic PET data. Because of the combination
of tomographic reconstruction and kinetic modeling,
direct reconstruction algorithms are more complicated than static image reconstruction. Different algorithms have been developed to balance the tradeoff
between simplicity in implementation and fast convergence. We hope that the information in this paper
can provide guidance to readers for choosing the
proper direct reconstruction algorithm in real applications. In some situations, the choice is clear. For
example, the nested EM algorithm should be preferred over the traditional EM algorithm for linear
parametric image reconstruction because the former
converges much faster while preserving the same
simplicity in implementation. In other situations, the
choice may be more dependent on the user. We note
that as long as the algorithm guarantees global convergence, a simple algorithm can still reach the final
solution, albeit with a large number of iterations. We
expect that direct parametric image reconstruction
will find more and more applications in dynamic PET
studies and more novel algorithms will be developed
in the future.
