The interaction between vision and audition was investigated using a signal detection method. A light
and tone were presented either in the same location or in different locations along the horizontal plane,
and the subjects responded with same-different judgments of stimulus location. Three modes of stimulus
presentation were used: simultaneous presentation ofthe light and tone, tone first, and light first. For the
latter two conditions, the interstimulus interval was either 0.7 or 2.0 sec. A statistical decision model was
developed which distinguished between the perceptual and decision processes. The results analyzed
within the framework of this model suggested that the apparent interaction between vision and audition is
due to shifts in decision criteria rather than perceptual change.
One of the most controversial issues in psychology
concerns the genesis of perceptual abilities and the
relations that exist among the sense modalities. Until

the judged position of one source was shifted toward

 . The bias measure is
especially vulnerable to this problem, and its validity
as an index of the perceptual process is questionable.
Auditory localization, even without interference from
other sensory information, is clearly a much more
difficult task than visual localization. When a subject
is asked to point to where he hears the sound coming
from in a conl1ict situation, it is possible that his
pointing response is influenced toward the
source simply because the latter is easier to localize.
Thus, one could argue that the subject's auditory
perception is not affected by visual perception. That
is, he might hear the sound in the same place whether
or not there is a disparate visual source, but he simply
"chooses" to point toward the visible source when it is

conclusions be made concerning the nature of the
apparent sensory interaction. The critical tinding is
that there was no difference in sensitivity between the
simultaneous trials and the TIL trials. Since the tone
was terminated before the presentation of the light.
visual dominance over audition should not have been
possible in TIL trials unless one postulates that the
memory of an auditory location can be biased by
vision. This hypothesis seems implausible for two
reasons. First. if auditory memory is intluenced by
decrease. Examination of correct responses indicate
that this was not the case. Although the frequency of
"same" responses on no-discrepancy trials was lower
in the TIL trials. a higher frequency of "different"
responses was obtained on discrepancy trials (see
Figure 2). Secondly. one would expect an even higher
frequency of "same" responses in the TIL trials if the
memory of the sound location was affected by the
light. simply because memory for the location of the
tone should decay and auditory localization should.

scores for vision over audition was bimodal. The two
modes were found around 98% and 12% visual bias,
indicating that some subjects localized exclusively in
tcrms of vision and others in terms of audition. One
interpretation for the bimodal distribution is that
these two groups of subjects had different perceptual
experiences. However. an alternative speculation is
that the observed bimodality was due to different
response strategies, and that there might have been no
difference in their perception. The latter argument is
plausible when one considers the criticized nature of
the bias measurerpossibly manifesting a change in the
response system. Another relevant observation for this
discussion is the different degrees of the subject's

awareness of a discrepancy. Few subjects experienced
discrepancy between vision and proprioception. while
many of the subjects were aware of visual-auditory
discrepancy. That is, the subjects realized that the
light and sound originated from different sources, and
therefore no contlict was experienced. Thus visual
dominance was not needed in this situation. In line
with this argument,
Welch showed that if
