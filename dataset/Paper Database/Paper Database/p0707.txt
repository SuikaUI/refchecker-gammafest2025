Advances in science often come from identifying
invariances—those elements that stay constant when others change. Kepler, for example, described the motion of
planets. From an Earth-bound vantage point, planets seem
to have strange and variable orbits. Not only do they differ
in their speeds and locations, they even appear to backtrack at times (a phenomenon known as retrograde motion). Although planetary orbits appear variable, Kepler
identified invariants in planetary motion. For example, all
orbits follow ellipses in which the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius. These
invariances formed the basis for Newton’s subsequent theory of mechanics . A similar story holds
in genetics, where Mendel’s discovery of invariant ratios
in phenotypes served as an important precursor for the
construction of genetic theory.
Although the search for invariances has often motivated
theory in other domains, it has not had as much impact
in psychology. Invariances are statements of equality,
sameness, or lack of association, whereas in practice, the
psychological field has a Popperian orientation, in which
demonstrations of effects or associations are valued more
than demonstrations of invariances . As a
contrast, we offer below a few examples of how scientific
inquiry in cognitive psychology has benefited from consideration of invariances:
1. It is often of great practical and theoretical interest to
determine whether performance is invariant to readily observable variables. For example, several researchers have
assessed whether cognitive skills vary with gender . To believe that only effects
of genders, rather than invariances across genders, will
appear in performance strikes us as an extreme position.
A second example comes from the domain of subliminal
priming : To prove that
subliminal priming occurs, it must be shown that detection
or identification of the primes does not vary from chance
 .
2. Conservation laws are instantiations of invariances.
An example of a proposed conservation law is the Weber–
Fechner law , which states that the
detectability of a briefly flashed stimulus is a function of
its intensity divided by the intensity of the background.
Accordingly, performance should be invariant when the
intensities of the flash and background are multiplied by
the same constant. Another example of a proposed conservation law is the choice rule , which states that the preference for a
choice is a function of the ratio of its utility divided by
the summed utility of all available choices. The key invariance here concerns ratios of preferences between any
two choices—for example, the preference for Choice A
divided by that for Choice B. This ratio should not vary
when choices are added or taken away from the set of
available options.
3. Testing invariances is critical for validating parametric descriptions. Consider the example of Stevens ,
who proposed that sensation follows a power function of
intensity. It is reasonable to expect that the exponent of

Progress in science often comes from discovering invariances in relationships among variables; these
invariances often correspond to null hypotheses. As is commonly known, it is not possible to state evidence
for the null hypothesis in conventional significance testing. Here we highlight a Bayes factor alternative to
the conventional t test that will allow researchers to express preference for either the null hypothesis or the
alternative. The Bayes factor has a natural and straightforward interpretation, is based on reasonable assumptions, and has better properties than other methods of inference that have been advocated in the psychological
literature. To facilitate use of the Bayes factor, we provide an easy-to-use, Web-based program that performs
the necessary calculations.

Critiques of Inference by Significance Tests
Before introducing Bayes factors, we present two related critiques of classic null-hypothesis significance
tests: (1) They do not allow researchers to state evidence
for the null hypothesis, and, perhaps more importantly,
(2) they overstate the evidence against the null hypothesis. To make these critiques concrete, assume that each of
N participants performs a task in two different experimental conditions. Let xi1 and xi2 denote the ith participant’s
mean RT in each of the two conditions, and let yi denote
the difference between these mean RTs. A typical test of
the effect of conditions is a one-sample t test to assess
whether the population mean of yi is different from zero.
The model underlying this test is
iid Normal(, À2), i  1, . . . , N.
The null hypothesis, denoted H0, corresponds to   0.
The alternative, denoted H1, corresponds to  p 0.
The first critique, that null-hypothesis significance tests
do not allow the analyst to state evidence for the null hypothesis, can be seen by considering how p values depend
on sample size. Significance tests seem quite reasonable
if the null is false. In this case, the t values tend to become
larger as sample size is increased; this in turn increases
the probability of correctly rejecting the null. In the largesample limit—that is, as the sample size becomes arbitrarily large—the t value grows without bound, and the
p value converges to zero. This behavior is desirable, because it implies that the null will always be rejected in
the large-sample limit when the null is false. Researchers, therefore, can rest assured that increasing sample size
will, on average, result in a gain of evidence against the
null when the null is, indeed, false.
The situation is less desirable, however, if the null is
true. When the null is true, the t values do not converge
to any limit with increasing sample size. For sample sizes
greater than 30 or so, the distribution of t values is well
approximated by a standard normal distribution. Corresponding p values are also distributed; when the null
is true, all p values are equally likely—that is, they are
distributed uniformly between 0 and 1. This distribution
holds regardless of sample size. The consequence of this
fact is that researchers cannot increase the sample size to
gain evidence for the null, because increasing the sample
size does not affect the distribution of p values. Of course,
this behavior is part of the design of significance tests and
reflects Fisher’s view that null hypotheses are only to be
rejected and never accepted .
One pernicious and little-appreciated consequence
of the inability to gain evidence for the null is that significance tests tend to overstate the evidence against it
 . A rejection of the null hypothesis may be an
exaggeration of the evidence for an effect. To show this
overstatement, we start by considering the behavior of significance tests in the large-sample limit. It is reasonable
to expect that in this limit, a method of inference always
yields the correct answer. In statistics, this property is
the power function will vary across variables of different
intensities, such as brightness or loudness. As pointed out
by Augustin , however, it is critical that the exponent be constant for a given-intensity variable. Exponents
should not, for instance, depend on the specific levels chosen in an experiment. Another example of a parametric
description is from Logan , who proposed
that response time (RT) decreases with practice as a power
function. For this description to be valid, an invariance in
the exponent across various experimental elements would
be expected (e.g., in alphabet arithmetic, the power should
be invariant across addends).
4. Assessing invariances is also critical for showing selective influence, which is a key method of benchmarking
formal models. Debner and Jacoby , for instance,
tested Jacoby’s process dissociation model by
manipulating attention at study in a memory task. This
manipulation should affect parameters that index conscious processes but not those that index automatic ones.
Similarly, the theory of signal detection stipulates that base-rate manipulations affect criteria but not sensitivity. Hence, an invariance of sensitivity over this manipulation is to be expected .
This small, selective set of examples demonstrates the
appeal of testing invariances for theory building. Even so,
it is worth considering the argument that invariances do
not exist, at least not exactly. Cohen , for example,
started with the proposition that all variables affect all others to some, possibly small, extent. Fortunately, there is
no real contradiction between adhering to Cohen’s view
that invariances cannot hold exactly and assessing invariances for theory building. The key here is that invariances
may not hold exactly for relatively trivial reasons that are
outside the domain of study. When they hold only approximately, they often provide a more parsimonious description of data than do the alternatives and can serve as guidance for theory development. Hence, whether one believes
that invariances may hold exactly or only approximately,
the search for them is intellectually compelling.
Perhaps the biggest hurdle to assessing invariances is
methodological. Invariances correspond to the null hypothesis of equality, but conventional significance tests do
not allow the analyst to state evidence for a null hypothesis. If an invariance holds, even approximately, then the
best-case significance test outcome is a failure to reject,
which is interpreted as a state of ignorance. In this article,
we recommend Bayes factors as a
principled method of inference for assessing both invariances and differences. Bayes factors have been recommended previously in the psychological literature .
In this article, we develop Bayes factor tests for paired
(one-sample) and grouped (two-sample) t tests. Moreover,
we provide a freely available, easy-to-use, Web-based program for this analysis (available at pcl.missouri.edu). We
anticipate that the approach presented here will generalize
to factorial designs across several variables.

null if the alternative is typical (  30) but favors the
alternative if the alternative is a small effect (  10). It
is an undeniable fact that inference depends on how much
weight the researcher places on various alternatives. Subsequently, we will discuss strategies for weighting alternatives. The second lesson is that significance tests overstate
the evidence against the null in finite samples because the
null may be more plausible than other reasonable alternatives. As a rule of thumb, inference based on evaluating a
null without comparison to alternatives tends to overstate
the evidence against the null. Some examples of this tendency include:
Confidence intervals (CIs). Cumming and Finch ,
Masson and Loftus , and Kline , among
many others, have recommended using CIs for inference.
We recommend CIs for reporting data, but not for inference . The problem with confidence intervals for inference is that they, like significance
tests, have a fixed probability of including the null when
the null is true, regardless of sample size. This property
implies that evidence cannot be gained for the null, and,
consequently, there is a tendency to overstate the evidence
against it. For the one-sample case, the null is rejected if
the CI around the mean does not include zero. This test is,
of course, equivalent to significance testing and suffers
analogously to the example above.
Probability of replication (prep). Killeen 
recommends computing the predictive posterior probability that a different sample from the same experiment
would yield an effect with the same sign as the original.
Inference is performed by rejecting the null if this probability is sufficiently large. Although this approach may
appear attractive, it is not designed to assess the replicatermed consistency, and inconsistent inferential methods
strike us as unsatisfying. If the null is false ( p 0), significance tests are consistent: The p values converge to zero,
and the null is always rejected. If the null is true (  0),
however, significance tests are inconsistent: Even in the
large-sample limit, the analyst mistakenly rejects the null
with probability (. This inconsistency is a bias to overstate the evidence against the null. This bias would be of
only theoretical interest if it held exclusively in the largesample limit. But in fact, it holds for realistic sample sizes
as well, and therefore is of practical concern. To show this
bias in realistic sample sizes, we present an argument motivated by that of Sellke et al.
Suppose that each of 100 participants provides 100 RT
measurements in each of two conditions. Let us assume
that RTs for each individual in each condition have a standard deviation (std) of 300 msec, which is reasonable for
RTs with means between 500 and 1,000 msec. The analyst
tabulates participant-by-condition means, denoted x1i and
x2i. These participant-by-condition means have standard
deviations of 300/·100  30. From these means, participant difference scores, yi  x2i  x1i, are calculated, and
the standard deviation1 of yi is ·2  30 . 42. Let us assume that the difference scores reveal a y  10-msec RT
advantage for one experimental condition over the other.
The t statistic is t  ·N  y/std( y)  10  10 / 42  2.38.
The associated p value is about .02. The conventional
wisdom is that this is a case in which the null hypothesis
is not tenable. We show below that this conclusion is an
overstatement.
One way of quantifying the evidence in the data is to
compute the likelihood of observing a t value of 2.38
under various hypotheses. The likelihood of t  2.38 for
the null is the density of a t distribution with 99 degrees of
freedom evaluated at 2.38. This likelihood is small, about
.025. Differences in RTs tend to vary across tasks, but even
so, it is common for reliable differences to be 30 msec or
more. The likelihood that t  2.38 for the more typical
difference of 30 msec is the density of a noncentral t distribution with 99 degrees of freedom and a noncentrality
parameter of (·N)/À, which is about 7.1. This likelihood
is quite small, about .000006. The likelihood ratio of the
null versus this typical effect is about 3,800:1 in favor of
the null. Hence, a likelihood ratio test of the null versus a
typical effect strongly favors the null.
Figure 1 shows this likelihood ratio for a range of alternatives. The filled square shows the likelihood ratio for
the example above of the null hypothesis versus a typical
effect of 30 msec. The null has greater likelihood for all
effects greater than about 20 msec. The fact that there is
a large range of reasonable alternatives against which the
null is preferable is not captured by the p value. In view of
this fact, rejection of null hypotheses by consideration of
p values under the null strikes us, as well as several other
commentators, as problematic.
There are two related lessons from the demonstration
above. The first is that the choice of alternative matters.
The evidence in the example above provides different support for the null depending on the alternative. It favors the

observed data are termed posterior; an appropriate statistic for comparing hypotheses is the posterior odds:
where H0 and H1 denote the null and alternative hypotheses, respectively. Odds are directly interpretable. For instance, if 6  19, the null is 19 times more probable than
the alternative, given the data. As Laplace first noted almost 200 years ago, computing posterior odds on hypotheses is natural for scientific communication . Jeffreys
recommends that odds greater than 3 be considered “some
evidence,” odds greater than 10 be considered “strong
evidence,” and odds greater than 30 be considered “very
strong evidence” for one hypothesis over another.
The posterior odds are given by
.  The term Pr(H0)/Pr(H1) is the prior odds. In practice,
it is often natural to set the prior odds to 1.0, a position
that favors neither the null nor the alternative. The terms
f(data | H0) and f(data | H1) are called the marginal likelihoods and are denoted more succinctly as M0 and M1,
respectively. The posterior odds is, therefore,
.  All of the evidence from the data is expressed in the ratio
of marginal likelihoods. This ratio is termed the Bayes
factor and is denoted by B01:
Consequently,
.  Marginal likelihoods for a given hypothesis H are given
where H denotes the parameter space under hypothesis
H, fH denotes the probability density function of the data
under hypothesis H, y denotes the data, and pH denotes
the prior distribution on the parameters. This equation is
most profitably viewed as a continuous average of likelihoods in which priors pH serve as the weights. If a prior
places weight on parameter values that are very unlikely
to have produced the data, the associated low likelihood
values will drag down the average. Hence, in order for the
marginal likelihood of a model to be competitive, the prior
should not attribute undue mass to unreasonable parameter values. As will be discussed in the next section, this
bility of invariances. As discussed by Wagenmakers and
Grünwald , prep is logically similar to p values in
that the distribution does not change with sample size
when the null holds. As such, it is open to the critiques of
p values above.
Neyman–Pearson (NP) hypothesis testing with fixed . Consequently, it is similarly biased toward overstating the evidence against the null. This point is
made elegantly by Raftery . NP testing can be made
consistent by allowing Type I error rates to decrease toward
zero as the sample size increases. How this rate should decrease with sample size, however, is neither obvious nor
stipulated by the statistical theory underlying NP testing.
The Akaike information criterion (AIC). The AIC
 is a method of model selection (rather than
testing) that is occasionally used in psychology . One advantage of the AIC is that it seemingly may
be used to state evidence for the null hypothesis. To use
the AIC, each model is given a score:
AIC  2 log L  2k,
where L is the maximum likelihood under the model and k
is the number of required parameters. The model with the
lowest AIC is preferred. AIC, however, has a bias to overstate the evidence against the null. This bias is easily seen
in the large-sample limit for the one-sample case. If the
AIC is consistent, the Type I error rate should decrease to
zero in the large-sample limit. According to AIC, the alternative is preferred when 2 log (L1  L0)  2, and the
Type I error rate is the probability of this event when the
null is true. Under the null, the quantity 2 log (L1  L0)
is asymptotically distributed as a chi-square with one degree of freedom .
The Type I error rate in the limit is therefore the probability that this chi-square distribution is greater than 2.0,
which is about .157 rather than 0.
In summary, conventional significance tests do not
allow the researcher to state evidence for the null. Hence,
they are not appropriate for competitively testing the null
against the alternative. As mentioned previously, invariances may play a substantial role in theory building.
Hence, methods for testing them are needed.
Bayes Factors
We advocate inference by Bayes factors . This method is logically sound and
yields a straightforward and natural interpretation of the
evidence afforded by data. In Bayesian statistics, it is possible to compute the probability of a hypothesis conditionally on observed data. Quantities that are conditional on

is specified. Figure 2A shows the effect of the choice of
the alternative, 1 (measured in units of À), on the Bayes
factor for a few values of y (also measured in units of À)
when N  100.2 This simple example illustrates that as
the alternative is placed farther from the observed data,
the Bayes factor increasingly favors the null. Moreover,
when the alternative is unrealistically far from the data,
the Bayes factor provides unbounded support for the null
hypothesis over this alternative. This insight that unrealistic alternatives yield support for the null will be utilized
in specifying appropriate alternatives.
In the example above, we assumed that the alternative was
at a single point. This assumption, however, is too restrictive
to be practical. Instead, it is more realistic to consider an
alternative that is a distribution across a range of outcomes.
For example, we may place a normal prior on :
 ~ Normal(0, À2).
The normal is centered around zero to indicate no prior commitment about the direction of effects. To use this normal
prior, the analyst must set À2 a priori. The critical question
is how the choice of À2 affects the Bayes factor.3 One might
set À2  @, which specifies no prior information about . In
fact, this setting is used as a noninformative prior in Bayesian estimation of  .
Figure 2B shows the effect of the choice of À2 (measured in units of À) on the resulting Bayes factor for a few
values of y (also measured in units of À) when N  100.
As À2 becomes large, the value of B01 increases, too. To
understand why this behavior occurs, it is helpful to recall
that the marginal likelihood of a composite hypothesis is
the weighted average of the likelihood over all constituent
point hypotheses, where the prior serves as the weight. As
fact is important in understanding why analysts must commit to reasonable alternatives for principled inference.
For the one-sample application, the null model has a
single parameter, À2, and the alternative model has two
parameters, À2 and . The marginal likelihoods are
For the one-sample case, priors are needed on À2 to describe the null hypothesis. Likewise, priors are needed on
 and À2 to describe the alternative. There are two different
schools of thought on how to choose priors in Bayesian
analysis. According to the first, subjective Bayes, school,
priors should reflect the analyst’s a priori beliefs about
parameters. These beliefs are informed by the theoretical and experimental context. According to the second,
objective Bayes, school, priors should reflect as few assumptions as possible. In this article, we take the objective
approach; that is, we seek priors that reflect a minimum
degree of information.
The Role of Priors
In this section, we discuss how the choice of priors affects the resulting Bayes factor. This discussion directly
motivates our recommendations and serves as a basis for
interpreting and understanding Bayes factors.
It is easiest to build intuition about the role of the priors in a simple case. Assume that À2 is known and the
alternative is a point much like the null. The null is given
by   0; the alternative is given by   1, where 1

ily. The advantage of this effect-size parameterization is
that researchers have an intrinsic scale about the ranges
of effect sizes that applies broadly across different tasks
and populations. For instance, effect sizes of 1.0 are large;
those of .02 are very small. Importantly, we can use this
knowledge to avoid placing too much weight on unreasonable effect-size values. For instance, we can all agree
that priors that place substantial mass on effect sizes over
6 are unrealistic; if a phenomenon yielded such large effect sizes, it would be so obvious as to make experiments
hardly necessary.
One reasonable setting is ÀY
2  1. The corresponding
prior on effect size, a standard normal, is shown in Figure 3B (dashed line) and is known as the unit-information
prior. The setting is reasonable because the distribution of
effect sizes under the alternative does not include much
mass on highly implausible effect sizes such as 6. One advantage of this setting is that small effects are assumed to
occur with greater frequency than large ones, which is in
accordance with what experimentalists tend to find. With
this setting, it can be shown that the alternative has only a
small amount of information—in fact, the amount in any
single observation . In fact,
the unit-information prior underlies the Bayesian information criterion .
With the normal prior, the analyst commits to a single,
specific value for ÀY
2, such as ÀY
2  1. There is, however,
an even less informative formulation: Instead of setting ÀY
to a single value, it can be allowed to range over a distribution of values. Zellner and Siow recommend the
following prior distribution for ÀY
2 ~ inverse chi-square(1).
À2 is increased, there is greater relative weight on larger
values of . Unreasonably large values of  under the alternatives provide increased support for the null (as shown
in Figure 2A). When these unreasonably large values of
 have increasing weight, the average favors the null to a
greater extent. Hence, specifications of alternatives that
weight unreasonably large effects heavily will yield Bayes
factors that too heavily support the null. Moreover, the setting of À2  @ implies that the Bayes factor provides unbounded support for the null, a fact known as the Jeffreys–
Lindley paradox . Therefore, arbitrarily
diffuse priors are not appropriate for hypothesis testing.
To use the normal prior for the alternative, the researcher must specify reasonable values for the variance
À2. One approach is to customize this choice for the paradigm at hand. For example, the choice À  20 msec may
be reasonable for exploring small effects such as those in
priming experiments. The value of À should be greater
with more-variable data, such as those from complicated
tasks or from clinical populations.
A well-known and attractive alternative to placing priors on the mean  is to place them on effect size, where
effect size is denoted by Y and given as Y  /À. The null
hypothesis is Y  0. Alternatives may be specified as a
normal prior on effect size:
Y ~ Normal . Reparameterizing the model in terms
of effect size Y rather than mean  does not change the
basic nature of the role of the prior. If ÀY
2 is set unrealistically high, the Bayes factor will favor the null too heav-

of Zellner and Siow. The JZS prior serves as the objective
prior for the one- and two-sample cases.
A Bayes-Factor One-Sample t Test
In the previous section, we outlined the JZS and unitinformation priors, with the JZS prior being noninformative for the one-sample case. In this section, we present
and discuss the Bayes factors for the JZS prior. The first
step in derivation is to compute marginal likelihoods M0
and M1 (by averaging the likelihoods with weights given
by the priors). These marginal likelihoods are then divided
to yield the Bayes factor. At the end of this process, Equation 1 (below) results for the Bayes factor, where t is the
conventional t statistic , N is the
number of observations, and v  N  1 is the degrees
of freedom. We refer to Equation 1 as the JZS Bayes factor for the one-sample problem. We recommend this JZS
Bayes factor as a default for conducting Bayesian t tests.
To our knowledge, Equation 1 is novel. The derivation is
straightforward and tedious and not particularly informative. Gönen et al. provided the analogous equation
for the unit-information Bayes factor. Liang et al. 
provided the corresponding JZS Bayes factors for testing
slopes in a regression model.
Although Equation 1 may look daunting, it is simple to
use. Researchers need only provide the sample size N and
the observed t value. There is no need to input raw data.
The integration is over a single dimension and is computationally straightforward. We provide a freely available
Web-based program that computes the JZS Bayes factor for input values of t and N (pcl.missouri.edu). It also
computes the unit-information Bayes factor—that is, the
Bayes factor when the unit-information prior is assumed.
Table 1 provides critical t values needed for JZS Bayes
factor values of 1/10, 1/3, 3, and 10 as a function of sample size. This table is analogous in form to conventional
t value tables for given p value criteria. For instance, suppose a researcher observes a t value of 3.3 for 100 observations. This t value favors the alternative and corresponds
to a JZS Bayes factor less than 1/10 because it exceeds
the critical value of 3.2 reported in the table. Likewise,
suppose a researcher observes a t value of 0.5. The corresponding JZS Bayes factor is greater than 10 because
the t value is smaller than 0.69, the corresponding critical value in Table 1. Because the Bayes factor is directly
interpretable as an odds ratio, it may be reported without
reference to cutoffs such as 3 or 1/10. Readers may decide
the meaning of odds ratios for themselves.
Figure 4 shows the critical t value needed for JZS Bayes
factors of 1/10, a substantial amount of evidence in favor
of the alternative (solid line). For large sample sizes, in-
The inverse chi-square family provides useful priors in
Bayesian statistics . The density function of the inverse chisquare with one degree of freedom is shown in Figure 3A.
Mass falls off for very small and very large values of ÀY
that is, ÀY is constrained to be somewhat near 1.0. This
specification is less informative than the previously discussed unit-information prior, which requires ÀY
Even though we explicitly place a prior on ÀY
2, there is a
corresponding prior on effect size obtained by integrating
2. Liang, Paulo, Molina, Clyde, and Berger 
noted that placing a normal on effect size with a variance
that is distributed as an inverse chi-square is equivalent to
placing the following prior on effect size:
Y ~ Cauchy.
The Cauchy distribution is a t distribution with a single
degree of freedom. It has tails so heavy that neither its
mean nor its variance exist. A comparison of the Cauchy
prior to the unit-information prior is shown in Figure 3B.
As can be seen, the Cauchy allows for more mass on large
effects than the standard normal. Consequently, Bayes
factors with the Cauchy prior favor the null a bit more
than those with the unit-information prior. It is important
to note that the Cauchy was not assumed directly; it results
from the assumption of a normal distribution on Y with
variance ÀY
2 distributed as an inverse chi-square. Jeffreys
 was the first to consider the Cauchy specification
of the alternative for Bayes factor calculations.
In the preceding analyses, we assumed that À2, the variability in the data, is known. Fortunately, it is relatively easy
to relax this assumption. The intuition from the preceding
discussion is that priors on parameters cannot be too variable, because they then include a number of unreasonable
values that, when included in the average, lower the marginal likelihood. This intuition is critical for comparisons of
models when a parameter enters into only one of the models,
as is the case for parameter Y. It is much less critical when
the parameter in question enters into both models, as is the
case for parameter À2. In this case, having mass on unrealistic values lowers the marginal likelihood of both models, and
this effect cancels in the Bayes factor ratio. For the one- and
two-sample cases, a very broad noninformative prior on À2
is possible. We make a standard choice: p(À2)  1/À2. This
prior is known as the Jeffreys prior on variance . The justification for this choice, though beyond the
scope of this article, is provided in all Bayesian textbooks.
With this choice for À2, the specification of priors is
complete. We refer to the combination of the Cauchy on effect size and the Jeffreys prior on variance as the JZS prior,
in order to acknowledge the contributions of Jeffreys and
232 ROUDER, SPECKMAN, SUN, MOREY, AND IVERSON
training was effective. The reported F value corresponds
to a t value of 2.39. The JZS Bayes factor for this contrast
is 0.63, which is about 1.6 to 1 in favor of the alternative.
These odds, however, do not constitute much evidence for
the effectiveness of the training program.
Subjectivity in Priors
The JZS prior is designed to minimize assumptions
about the range of effect size, and in this sense it is an
objective prior. In many cases, researchers have knowledge of the domain that may improve inference. This
knowledge may be incorporated by changing the form
of the prior. On a rather mundane level, a researcher may
believe that psychologists tend not to run experiments to
search for effects so large that they may be confirmed
with 10 or fewer observations. This belief implies that
effect sizes much greater than 2.0 in magnitude are improbable, because larger effect sizes would be evident
with only a handful of observations. This belief, which
strikes us as reasonable in many contexts, might lead
some analysts to choose the unit-information Bayes
factor over the JZS Bayes factor, since the tails of the
normal prior on effect size fall more quickly than those
of the Cauchy (see Figure 3B). We recommend that researchers incorporate information when they believe it
to be appropriate. If they have no such information or
wish not to commit to any, the JZS prior can serve as
the noninformative default. The Web-based program also
calculates unit-information Bayes factors.
Researchers may also incorporate expectations and
goals for specific experimental contexts by tuning the
scale of the prior on effect size. The JZS prior on effect
creasingly larger t values are needed to maintain the same
odds. This behavior ensures that the JZS Bayes factor
does not favor the alternative when there are small effects
in large samples. The dashed-and-dotted line shows the
needed t value for p  .05. This t value does not increase
with sample size. Also shown is the curve for the unitinformation Bayes factor (longer dashed line), which is
derived from the unit-information prior (ÀY
2  1) with a
noninformative Jeffreys prior on À2—that is, p(À2)  1/À2.
As can be seen, the unit-information Bayes factor behaves
similarly to the JZS Bayes factor. The shorter dashed line
is for the BIC, which is discussed subsequently.
Figure 4 reveals that inference with a criterial p value
of .05 admits much lower t values as evidence against the
null hypothesis than do Bayesian methods with criterial
odds of 10:1. This difference has implications in practice.
We highlight a few recent examples from the literature
in which researchers have rejected the null even though
the posterior odds do not indicate that such a rejection is
warranted. Grider and Malmberg assessed whether
participants remembered emotional words better than
neutral ones in a recognition memory task. In their Experiment 3, they used a forced choice paradigm in which the
targets and lures at test had the same emotional valence.
The advantage of this design is that any difference in accuracy could not be due to a response bias for a particular
emotional-valence level. Grider and Malmberg claimed
that emotional words were remembered better than neutral
ones on the basis of two paired t tests on accuracy: one
between neutral and positive words [.76 vs. .80; t(79) 
2.24] and one between neutral and negative words [.76 vs.
.79; t(79)  2.03]. The JZS Bayes factors for these t values and the sample size of N  80 may be obtained from
the Web-based program. The resulting values are B01 
1.02 and B01  1.56 for the two tests, which can only be
considered as ambiguous evidence. The latter contrast is
especially interesting because the evidence favors the null
slightly (odds of 3:2), even though the null is rejected by
a significance test with p
Another example comes from Plant and Peruche
 , who assessed whether a sensitivity training program reduced the likelihood that law enforcement officers mistakenly shot civilians in a computer simulation.
They assessed how 48 participating officers performed
before and after training. On the basis of a significant onesample F test [F(1,47)  5.70], they concluded that the

BAYES FACTOR 233
Figure 5 shows how the Bayes factor depends on sample
size for the small true effect size of Y  .02. For small to
moderate sample sizes, the Bayes factor supports the null.
As the sample size becomes exceedingly large, however,
the small deviations from the null are consequential, and
the Bayes factor yields less support for the null. In the largesample limit, the Bayes factor favors the alternative, since
the null is not exactly true. This behavior strikes us as ideal.
With smaller sample sizes that are insufficient to differentiate between approximate and exact invariances, the Bayes
factors allows researchers to gain evidence for the null.
This evidence may be interpreted as support for at least an
approximate invariance. In very large samples, however,
the Bayes factor allows for the discovery of small perturbations that negate the existence of an exact invariance. In
sum, the Bayes factor favors the more parsimonious nullmodel description with small observed effect sizes unless
the sample size is so large that even these small effects are
not compatible with the null relative to the alternative.6
Extension to Two-Sample Designs
The Bayes factor in Equation 1 is applicable for onesample designs and is analogous to a paired t test. Onesample designs are common in experimental psychology
because variables are often manipulated in a within-
subjects manner. Between-subjects designs are also common and are often used to compare participant variables
such as age or gender. For cases with two independent
size can be generalized to Y ~ r  Cauchy, where r is a
scale factor.4 The unit-information prior can be scaled,
too: Y ~ Normal(0, r2). In this case, however, the term
unit-information prior may be misleading, and we prefer the term scaled-information prior.5 For both JZS and
scaled-information priors, as r is increased, the Bayes factor provides increased support for the null. In Equation 1,
the scale r is implicitly set to 1.0, which serves as a natural
benchmark. Smaller values of r, say 0.5, may be appropriate when small effect sizes are expected a priori; larger
values of r are appropriate when large effect sizes are expected. The choice of r may be affected by theoretical considerations, as well: Smaller values are appropriate when
small differences are of theoretical importance, whereas
larger values are appropriate when small differences most
likely reflect nuisances and are of little theoretical importance. In all cases, the value of r should be chosen prior to
analysis and without influence from the data. In summary,
r  1.0 is recommended, though a priori adjustments may
be warranted in certain contexts. The aforementioned
Web-based program allows researchers to specify r, with
r  1.0 serving as a default.
It may appear that Bayes factors are too dependent on
the prior to be of much use. Perhaps researchers can engineer any result they wish by surreptitiously choosing a
self-serving prior. This appearance is deceiving. Bayes factors are not particularly sensitive to reasonable variation
in priors, at least not with moderate sample sizes. In practice, dramatic changes in the priors often have marginal
effects on the results. The previous example of the results
from Grider and Malmberg is useful for making this
point. The t value of 2.03 actually corresponded to slight
evidence for the null (B01  1.56), even though the null
was rejected at the p
.05 level. A reasonable conclusion
is that there was not enough evidence in the experiment
to express preference for either the null or the alternative
hypothesis. The unit-information Bayes factor in this case
is 1.21, which leads to the same conclusion. Suppose we
commit a priori to an alternative that is characterized by
very small effect sizes for Grider and Malmberg’s experiments. Setting r  0.1, which seems too low, results in a
JZS Bayes factor of 0.59. Although this value now slightly
favors the alternative, it does not support a preference for it.
For Grider and Malmberg’s data, any reasonable prior leads
to the same conclusion, that the evidence does not support
a preference. In general, researchers may differ in their
choice of priors. If these differences are reasonable, they
will have only modest effects on the resulting conclusions.
Bayes Factors With Small Effects
Previously, we considered the argument that invariances
are only true approximately and never exactly . In this section, we explore the behavior of Bayes
factors when an invariance holds approximately rather
than exactly. As discussed previously, the view that the
null can never hold exactly does not negate its usefulness
as an idealization. Our main question is whether the Bayes
factor provides an appropriate decision about whether the
null or the alternative provides a better description of the
data for very small true effect sizes.
Bayes Factor
Sample Size
Figure 5. Bayes factors for a small true effect size (.02). Shown
is the expected unit-information Bayes factor as a function of
sample size. These expected values are obtained by a Monte Carlo
simulation in which data are repeatedly sampled from a normal
distribution with effect size Y  .02. As shown, the Bayes factor
allows researchers to gain evidence for the approximate invariance with sample sizes below 5,000 and to gain evidence for small
effects with sample sizes over 50,000. The JZS Bayes factor acts
similarly, although the evaluation of the integral is unstable for
sample sizes 5,000.
234 ROUDER, SPECKMAN, SUN, MOREY, AND IVERSON
Consequently,
We have included critical t values for B*  1/10 (10:1
favoring the alternative) in Figure 4. As can be seen, the
BIC behaves well for large samples.
BIC is an asymptotic approximation to a Bayes factor
with certain priors . For the one-sample
case, these priors are
where R  y and RÀ2  (1/N )( yi  y)2 are the maximum
likelihood estimators of  and À2, respectively. These
priors are more informative than the ones we advocate.
There are two main differences: (1) The prior variance on
 is the sample variance. In Bayesian inference, it is not
valid to specify a prior that depends on the observed data.
The justification for this prior is that it is a convenient
large-sample approximation for a unit-information prior.
Hence, it may only be interpreted for large-sized samples.
The JZS and unit-information priors, on the other hand,
do not depend on the observed data. As a consequence,
the resulting Bayes factors may be interpreted with confidence for all sample sizes. (2) Because BIC approximates
a unit-information prior, it is slightly more informative
than the JZS prior. As such, the resulting BIC values will
slightly favor the alternative more than the JZS Bayes factor would.
BIC is not well-suited for mixed models, such as
within-subjects ANOVA. The problem is that BIC is based
on counting parameters. The more parameters a model
has, the more it is penalized for complexity. In standard
between-subjects designs with fixed effects, the number
of parameters is unambiguous. In mixed designs, however,
each participant is modeled as a random effect that is neither entirely free (the effects must conform to a particular distribution) nor heavily constrained. It is not obvious
how these random effects are to be counted or penalized in
BIC. Bayes factors also penalize complex models, but they
do so without recourse to counting parameters. Instead,
complex models are penalized by the diversity of data patterns they explain . It is known that
JZS priors extend well to simple random- effects models
 , and we anticipate that they
may be used more generally in mixed models, especially
with within-subjects factorial designs.
General Discussion
There has been a long-lasting and voluminous debate
in both psychology and statistics on the value of significance tests. Most of this debate has centered on the
proper way to test for effects. We advocate a different
focus: Psychologists should search for theoretically interesting invariances or regularities in data. Conventional
significance tests are ill-suited for stating evidence for
groups, the two-sample (groups) t test is appropriate.
Below is the development of the JZS Bayes factor for the
two-sample case.
Let xi and yi denote the ith observations in the first and
second groups, respectively. These observations are conventionally modeled as
iid Normal M
, i  1, . . . , Nx ,
iid Normal M
, i  1, . . . , Ny ,
where  and ( denote the grand mean and total effect,
respectively, and Nx and Ny denote the sample size for the
first and second groups, respectively. The null hypothesis corresponds to (  0. As before, it is convenient to
consider an effect size, Y  (/À. In this parameterization,
the null hypothesis corresponds to Y  0; the JZS prior
for Y under the alternative is given by
Y ~ Cauchy.
Priors are needed for  and À2. Fortunately, these parameters are common to both models, and the resulting
Bayes factor is relatively robust to the choice. The Jeffreys
noninformative prior on À2, p(À2)  1/À2, is appropriate.
A noninformative prior may also be placed on . In this
prior, all values of  are equally likely; this prior is denoted p()  1.
Equation 1 may be adapted to compute the two-sample
JZS Bayes factor with the following three substitutions:
(1) The value of t is the observed two-sample (grouped)
t value; (2) the effective sample size is N  NxNy/(Nx 
Ny); and (3) the degrees of freedom are v  Nx  Ny  2.
Our Web-based program also computes JZS and unit
Bayes factors for this two-sample case; the user need only
input both sample sizes and the group t value.
Bayesian Information Criterion
The BIC is a Bayesian model selection technique that has been recommended in psychology
 . In the BIC, each model
is given a score:
BIC  2 log L  k log N,
where L is the maximum likelihood of the model, N is the
sample size, and k is the number of parameters. Models
with lower BIC scores are preferred to models with higher
ones. As pointed out by Raftery , differences in
BIC scores may be converted into an approximate Bayes
where BIC0 and BIC1 are the BIC scores for the null and
the alternative, respectively. For the one-sample case, it is
straightforward to show that

invariances and, as a consequence, overstate the evidence
against them.
It is reasonable to ask whether hypothesis testing is always
necessary. In many ways, hypothesis testing has been employed in experimental psychology too often and too hastily, without sufficient attention to what may be learned by
exploratory examination for structure in data .
To observe structure, it is often sufficient to plot estimates
of appropriate quantities along with measures of estimation
error . As a rule of thumb, hypothesis testing should be reserved for those cases in which the
researcher will entertain the null as theoretically interesting
and plausible, at least approximately.
Researchers willing to perform hypothesis testing must
realize that the endeavor is inherently subjective . For any data set, the null will be superior
to some alternatives and inferior to others. Therefore, it
is necessary to commit to specific alternatives, with the
resulting evidence dependent to some degree on this commitment. This commitment is essential to and unavoidable for sound hypothesis testing in both frequentist and
Bayesian settings. We advocate Bayes factors because
their interpretation is straightforward and natural. Moreover, in Bayesian analysis, the elements of subjectivity
are transparent rather than hidden .
This commitment to specify judicious and reasoned alternatives places a burden on the analyst. We have provided
default settings appropriate to generic situations. Nonetheless, these recommendations are just that and should not be
used blindly. Moreover, analysts can and should consider
their goals and expectations when specifying priors. Simply put, principled inference is a thoughtful process that
cannot be performed by rigid adherence to defaults.
There is no loss in dispensing with the illusion of objectivity in hypothesis testing. Researchers are acclimated
to elements of social negotiation and subjectivity in scientific endeavors. Negotiating the appropriateness of various alternatives is no more troubling than negotiating the
appropriateness of other elements, including design, operationalization, and interpretation. As part of the everyday
practice of psychological science, we have the communal
infrastructure to evaluate and critique the specification of
alternatives. This view of negotiated alternatives is vastly
preferable to the current practice, in which significance
tests are mistakenly regarded as objective. Even though
inference is subjective, we can agree on the boundaries
of reasonable alternatives. The sooner we adopt inference
based on specifying alternatives, the better.
