Preface to the Second Edition
This edition contains a large number of additions and corrections scattered
throughout the text, including the incorporation of a new chapter on
state-space models. The companion diskette for the IBM PC has expanded
into the software package ITSM: An Interactive Time Series Modelling
Package for the PC, which includes a manual and can be ordered from
Springer-Verlag.*
We are indebted to many readers who have used the book and programs
and made suggestions for improvements. Unfortunately there is not enough
space to acknowledge all who have contributed in this way; however, special
mention must be made of our prize-winning fault-finders, Sid Resnick and
F. Pukelsheim. Special mention should also be made of Anthony Brockwell,
whose advice and support on computing matters was invaluable in the
preparation of the new diskettes. We have been fortunate to work on the
new edition in the excellent environments provided by the University of
Melbourne and Colorado State University. We thank Duane Boes
particularly for his support and encouragement throughout, and the
Australian Research Council and National Science Foundation for their
support of research related to the new material. We are also indebted to
Springer-Verlag for their constant support and assistance in preparing the
second edition.

Preface to the Second Edition
Note added in the eighth printing: The computer programs referred to in the text
have now been superseded by the package ITSM2000, the student version of which
accompanies our other text, Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting, also
published by Springer-Verlag. Enquiries regarding purchase of the professional

Preface to the First Edition
We have attempted in this book to give a systematic account of linear time
series models and their application to the modelling and prediction of data
collected sequentially in time. The aim is to provide specific techniques for
handling data and at the same time to provide a thorough understanding of
the mathematical basis for the techniques. Both time and frequency domain
methods are discussed but the book is written in such a way that either
approach could be emphasized. The book is intended to be a text for graduate
students in statistics, mathematics, engineering, and the natural or social
sciences. It has been used both at the M.S. level, emphasizing the more
practical aspects of modelling, and at the Ph.D. level, where the detailed
mathematical derivations of the deeper results can be included.
Distinctive features of the book are the extensive use of elementary Hilbert
space methods and recursive prediction techniques based on innovations, use
of the exact Gaussian likelihood and AIC for inference, a thorough treatment
of the asymptotic behavior of the maximum likelihood estimators of the
coefficients of univariate ARMA models, extensive illustrations of the techniques by means of numerical examples, and a large number of problems for
the reader. The companion diskette contains programs written for the IBM
PC, which can be used to apply the methods described in the text. Data sets
can be found in the Appendix, and a more extensive collection (including most
ofthose used for the examples in Chapters l, 9, 10, 11 and 12) is on the diskette.
Simulated ARMA series can easily be generated and filed using the program
PEST. Valuable sources of additional time-series data are the collections of
Makridakis et al. and Working Paper 109 of Scientific Computing
Associates, DeKalb, Illinois.
Most of the material in the book is by now well-established in the time
series literature and we have therefore not attempted to give credit for all the
Preface to the First Edition
results discussed. Our indebtedness to the authors of some of the well-known
existing books on time series, in particular Anderson, Box and Jenkins, Fuller,
Grenander and Rosenblatt, Hannan, Koopmans and Priestley will however
be apparent. We were also fortunate to have access to notes on time series by
W. Dunsmuir. To these and to the many other sources that have influenced
our presentation of the subject we express our thanks.
Recursive techniques based on the Kalman filter and state-space representations of ARMA processes have played an important role in many recent
developments in time series analysis. In particular the Gaussian likelihood of
a time series can be expressed very simply in terms of the one-step linear
predictors and their mean squared errors, both of which can be computed
recursively using a Kalman filter. Instead of using a state-space representation
for recursive prediction we utilize the innovations representation of an arbitrary Gaussian time series in order to compute best linear predictors and exact
Gaussian likelihoods. This approach, developed by Rissanen and Barbosa,
Kailath, Ansley and others, expresses the value of the series at time t in terms
of the one-step prediction errors up to that time. This representation provides
insight into the structure of the time series itself as well as leading to simple
algorithms for simulation, prediction and likelihood calculation.
These algorithms are used in the parameter estimation program (PEST)
found on the companion diskette. Given a data set of up to 2300 observations,
the program can be used to find preliminary, least squares and maximum
Gaussian likelihood estimators of the parameters of any prescribed A RIMA
model for the data, and to predict future values. It can also be used to simulate
values of an ARMA process and to compute and plot its theoretical autocovariance and spectral density functions. Data can be plotted, differenced,
deseasonalized and detrended. The program will also plot the sample autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions of both the data itself and
the residuals after model-fitting. The other time-series programs are SPEC,
which computes spectral estimates for univariate or bivariate series based on
the periodogram, and TRANS, which can be used either to compute and plot
the sample cross-correlation function of two series, or to perform least squares
estimation of the coefficients in a transfer function model relating the second
series to the first (see Section 12.2). Also included on the diskette is a screen
editing program (WORD6), which can be used to create arbitrary data files,
and a collection of data files, some of which are analyzed in the book.
Instructions for the use of these programs are contained in the file HELP on
the diskette.
For a one-semester course on time-domain analysis and modelling at the
M.S. level, we have used the following sections of the book:
1.1-1.6; 2.1-2. 7; 3.1-3.5; 5.1-5.5; 7.1, 7.2; 8.1-8.9; 9.1-9.6
(with brief reference to Sections 4.2 and 4.4). The prerequisite for this course
is a knowledge of probability and statistics at the level of the book Introduction
to the Theory of Statistics by Mood, Graybill and Boes.
Preface to the First Edition
For a second semester, emphasizing frequency-domain analysis and multivariate series, we have used
4.1-4.4, 4.6-4.1 0; 10.1-10. 7; 11.1-11. 7; selections from Chap. 12.
At the M.S. level it has not been possible (or desirable) to go into the mathematical derivation of all the results used, particularly those in the starred
sections, which require a stronger background in mathematical analysis and
measure theory. Such a background is assumed in all of the starred sections
and problems.
For Ph.D. students the book has been used as the basis for a more
theoretical one-semester course covering the starred sections from Chapters
4 through 11 and parts of Chapter 12. The prerequisite for this course is a
knowledge of measure-theoretic probability.
We are greatly indebted to E.J. Hannan, R.H. Jones, S.l. Resnick, S.Tavare
and D. Tjostheim, whose comments on drafts of Chapters 1-8 led to substantial improvements. The book arose out of courses taught in the statistics
department at Colorado State University and benefitted from the comments
of many students. The development of the computer programs would not have
been possible without the outstanding work of Joe Mandarino, the architect
of the computer program PEST, and Anthony Brockwell, who contributed
WORD6, graphics subroutines and general computing expertise. We are
indebted also to the National Science Foundation for support for the research
related to the book, and one of us (P.J.B.) to Kuwait University for providing
an excellent environment in which to work on the early chapters. For permission to use the optimization program UNC22MIN we thank R. Schnabel of
the University of Colorado computer science department. Finally we thank
Pam Brockwell, whose contributions to the manuscript went far beyond those
of typist, and the editors of Springer-Verlag, who showed great patience and
cooperation in the final production of the book.
