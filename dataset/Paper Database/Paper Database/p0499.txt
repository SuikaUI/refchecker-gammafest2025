CONVEX PROGRAMMING IN HILBERT SPACE

Communicated by V. Klee, May 1, 1964
This note gives a construction for minimizing certain twice-differentiable functions on a closed convex subset C, of a Hubert Space, H.
The algorithm assumes one can constructively "project" points onto
convex sets. A related algorithm may be found in Cheney-Goldstein
[l], where a constructive fixed-point theorem is employed to construct points inducing a minimum distance between two convex sets.
In certain instances when such projections are not too difficult to
construct, say on spheres, linear varieties, and orthants, the method
can be effective. For applications to control theory, for example, see
Balakrishnan , and Goldstein .
In what follows P will denote the "projection" operator for the
convex set C. This operator, which is well defined and Lipschitzian,
assigns to a given point in H its closest point in C (see, e.g., [l]).
Take x £ f f and y £ C . Then [x — y, P(x) —y]^\\P(x)
—y\\2. In the
nontrivial case this inequality is a consequence of the fact that C is
supported by a hyperplane through P(x) with normal x — P(x). Let
ƒ be a real-valued function on H and x0 an arbitrary point of C. Let
5 denote the level set (xGC:/(x) ^f(x0)},
and let S be any open set
containing the convex hull of S. Let ƒ'(*, •)= [V/(x), •] signify the
Fréchet derivative of ƒ at x. A point zin C will be called stationary if
P(z—pVf(z)) =z for all p > 0 ; equivalently, when ƒ is convex the linear
functional f (z, •) achieves a minimum on C at z.
THEOREM. Assume f is bounded below. For each xÇzS, h in H and for
some Po>0, assume that f (x, h) exists in the sense of Fréchet, fix,
exists in the sense of Gâteaux, and \f"(x, h, h) | ^||fe||2/Po- Choose cr and
pk satisfying 0<<r^p0 and <r^pk^2po — a. Set Xk+i = P(xk—pkVf(%k)).
(i) The sequence xk belongs to 5, (xk+i — xk) converges to 0, and f(xk)
converges downward to a limit L.
(ii) If S is compact, zis a cluster point of {xk}, and Vf is continuous
in some neighborhood of z, then z is a stationary point. If z is unique,
xk converges to z, and z minimizes ƒ on C.
(iii) If S is convex and f'{x,
h, h) ^/x||&||2 for each xGS, hÇzH and
some /x^0, then L = inf {ƒ(#) : xÇzC}.
(iv) Assume (iii) with S bounded. Weak cluster points of {xk}
minimize ƒ on C.

(v) Assume (iii) with JJL positive and Vf bounded on S. Then f (z) = L
for some z in S, Xk converges to z, and z is unique.
PROOF. Assume Xk belongs to S and that xk is not stationary. Let
?ƒ(**) = v/*, x(p) =P(xk -pV/*), S(p) =*(p) -xkand
A(p) =ƒ(**) -f(*(p)).
If we notice that — P[V/A;, ô(p)] ^||S(p)||2 and invoke Taylor's theorem, we obtain A(p) è||a(p)||*{p-l-/"(S(p), S(p), 5(p))/2||8(p)||*}.
Here £(p) =xfc+^ô(p) with £G(0, 1). For some p sufficiently small and
positive, A(p) is positive and continuous. Let fi denote the least positive p satisfying A(p)=0, if such exists. If $ exists, A(p)=0 implies
that joè2p0. Thus if <rgip^2po — <rf A(p)>0 and x(p)ES, whence
A(p*)è||**+i —**||W4po, proving (i).
The proof of (ii) being straightforward, we proceed with the proof
of (iii). Suppose that L^inf {f(x): xÇ~C} and choose s £ C such that
Then 0>ƒ(*)-ƒ(**) ê [V/*, * - * * ] . If lim inf[V/*, s-**]=/3
were non-negative, a contradiction would be manifest. But the inequality [pkV/ft, 2 — **+!] è [xk — #*+l, 2] + [tffc+i,
] holds because either Xk—PkVfk — Xk+i is the normal to C at Xk+i, or it is 0. If
the sequence Xk is bounded, clearly j3 = 0; otherwise choose a subsequence satisfying ||#*+i||>||#fc||. Then jS^O.
To prove (iv) we observe that ƒ is lower semi-continuous on S if
and only if the set Sm— {xÇiS:f(x)
is closed in 5 for each m.
Since ƒ is convex and continuous, Sm is closed and convex, and is thus
weakly closed. Hence ƒ is weakly l.s.c. If Xk converges weakly to z,
then lim inf f(xk)
Assume the hypotheses of (v). If s>k, we may write that 0 > f(x8)
—f(xk) è [V/fc, x8 — Xk] + (l/2)n\\xa — xk\\2j whence {x8} is bounded. Invoking again the supporting hyperplane at Xk+i, [puVfk, x8 — xk]
ê [pfcV/fc, Xk+i — Xk]+[xk+i — Xk, Xk+i — x8]. Thus when k is sufficiently
large \\x8 — xk\\ <e. There exists therefore s £ 5 minimizing ƒ on C, and
/(*)è/(s) + [V/(a), x~z] + (l/2)4x-z\\\
[V/(s), x - s ] è O ,
/(^)-/(«)è(l/2)At||^-*|| a; and therefore 2 is unique.
