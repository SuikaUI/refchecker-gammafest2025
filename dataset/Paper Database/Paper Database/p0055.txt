Objective-To evaluate a personalised computer
supportededucationprogramme forasthmapatients.
Design-Pragmatic randomised trial comparing
outcomes over 12 months between patients taking
part in an enhanced education programme (four
personalised booklets, sent by post) and patients
receiving conventional oral education at outpatient
or surgery visits.
Setting-Hospital outpatient clinics and general
practices in north east Scotland.
Subjects-801 adults attending hospital outpatient
clinics, with a diagnosis of asthma confirmed by a
chest physician and pulmonary function reversibility
ofat least 20%.
Main outcome measures-Numbers of hospital
admissions, consultations with general practitioner
for asthma, steroid courses used, bronchodilators
and inhaled steroids prescribed, days of restricted
activity, and disturbed nights.
Results-Patients with asthma judged too severe
for randomisation between clinic care and integrated
care and thus retained in clinic care had 54% fewer
admissions
education than did the control group (95% confidence interval 30% to 97%; P< 0*05) over the study
year. Patients had not all spent a full year as
"educated" patients within the study year: when
controlled
admission rates for the entire enhanced education
group were 49% (31% to 78%) of those in the control
group. Among patients with sleep variation, sleep
disturbance in the education group in the week
before a regular review was 80% (65% to 97%) ofthat
in the control group. There was no significant
difference in days ofrestricted activity, prescription
of bronchodilators or inhaled steroids, use of oral
steroids, or number ofgeneral practitioner consultations for asthma, and no significant interaction
between ownership of a peak flow meter and education.
Conclusions-An asthma education programme
based on computerised booklets can reduce hospital
admissions and improve morbidity among hospital
outpatients.
Introduction
In chronic illness such as asthma, diabetes, and
hypertension, effective self management is crucial to
the success of treatment. Asthma patients have a range
of strategies available for controlling severe episodes
and for maintaining their everyday functioning at the
best possible
level. Many patients, however, have
practices and beliefs which lead to poor management of
acute episodes and limited benefit from their regular
treatment.'
There has been increasing interest in improving self
management
education.
Initially,
results of educational interventions were not encouraging: patients' knowledge of some aspects of asthma
improved, but clinical outcomes did not change.23
Recent programmes
improving self management: days in hospital and visits
to outpatient clinics were reduced for 38 patients who
took part in an "asthma school"4; morbidity and
frequency of severe episodes were reduced in 124
patients taking part in a self management programme';
use of oral steroids and visits to general practice for
emergency nebulisation fell among 115 patients after
an asthma clinic run by nurses was introduced6; and
admissions and days in hospital were reduced after an
outpatient treatment programme
patients with a history ofmultiple attacks.7
Such intensive education requires considerable time
and commitment by staff and may not be appropriate
for all patients. We therefore investigated whether a
written patient education programme, personalised
from a computer database and with interactive aspects,
clinical outcomes
outpatients with
asthma. This investigation formed part ofthe Grampian
asthma study of integrated care (GRASSIC), designed
to evaluate the effectiveness of enhanced education,
peak flow self monitoring, and integrated care for
asthma patients.8 9
RESEARCH DESIGN
A total of 801 patients attending outpatient chest
clinics in Aberdeen, Banff, Elgin, and Peterhead were
entered into the Grampian asthma study. To be eligible
patients had to be 16 years or over, have a diagnosis of
asthma confirmed by a chest physician, and have
shown pulmonary function reversibility of at least
20%. Patients were recruited as they attended outpatient clinics for review between October 1989 and
December 1990. Each participated in the study for one
year. On entry patients were assessed as eligible for
randomisation between integrated care and clinic care
(n=712) or not eligible for randomisation and retained
in clinic care (n=89). Some patients had a peak flow
meter on entry to the study (n= 232), if not they were
randomly prescribed a peak flow meter (n=285) or no
peak flow meter (n=284). Patients were randomly
allocated between enhanced education (n=397) and
control group (n 404) within each combination ofcare
type and ownership ofpeak flow meter. The advantages
ofthis 2 x 2 x 2 design have been described elsewhere.8 9
ENHANCED PATIENT EDUCATION

addition, patients in the enhanced education group
received four printed booklets on asthma management
covering both regular control and action in acute
episodes. The first booklet was given to patients at
their clinic appointment, and the other three booklets
were mailed at monthly intervals. A questionnaire with
each booklet asked patients to

EVALUATION OF ENHANCED EDUCATION
Outcomes were evaluated over the year that patients
spent in the study. Although patients entered the study
education programme from beginning until June 1990.
This meant that, although all patients in the education
group completed the programme, the amount of time
they spent within the study as "educated" patients
varied; to take account of this, the number of "educated days" for each patient was taken from the
beginning of his or her education programme to the
end of the year in the study. For patients in the control
group-those receiving only conventional educationthe number ofeducated days was taken as zero.
All patients were reviewed every three months by
their general practitioner or a hospital doctor. At each
of the scheduled consultations during the study year
the doctor was asked to record information on the
of prescriptions
bronchodilators
inhaled steroids, use of oral steroids, and general
practitioner consultations for troublesome asthma. In
addition, number of nights disturbed by asthma in the
previous week and days of restricted activity in the
previous month were noted. These data were averaged
over the study year. Hospital admissions over the study
year were obtained from a review of all case notes.
symptom measures were used to evaluate the effectiveness ofthe education programme.

programme on the chosen outcome variables in two
steps: a first comparison between the two groups as
randomised to test for a general education effect, and
by estimating the effect of educated days for the chosen
outcome and the reported mean adjusted to 365
educated days.
For outcome measurements which count events (for
bronchodilator
prescriptions)
generalised
linear interactive modelling (GLIM)" was used to test
for significant effects of education or educated days
after initial peak flow, forced expiratory volume in one
second as percentage of predicted), and duration of
asthma were corrected for. As none of the clinical
measures was normally distributed, we used a Poisson
error structure and a log link function and included a
scale factor when necessary to overcome the problem of
overdispersion. 12
Examination of the two symptom variables showed
that some patients never reported restricted activity or
disturbed nights. (There was no association between
this group and being randomised to enhanced education or convention education.) Only those patients who
showed variation in their number of disturbed nights
or of restricted days were analysed by GLIM with
normal error and a log link function.
Our basic sample size of 801 provides 80% power of
detecting at the 5% level of significance a difference
between each pair of assignments (along each of the
three dimensions) equivalent to 20% of the standard
deviation in question.
INTERACTION BETWEEN THE THREE INNOVATIONS
The GLIM package was used to test for any interaction between the unrandomised subgroups of the
sample and any ofthe three interventions, singly and in
combination
after correcting for
initial peak flow,
forced expiratory volume (as a percentage ofpredicted),
and duration of asthma. The same technique was
applied to test for interaction between all combinations
ofthe three interventions.
Of the 801 patients in the study, 397 entered the
education group and 404 the control group. Table I
shows basic patient characteristics.
PATIENT EVALUATION OF THE EDUCATION PROGRAMME
receiving the enhanced education
programme rated the usefulness of topics and chose topics
on which they would like more information by returning questionnaires accompanying each booklet. Three
hundred and seventeen questionnaires (81%) were
returned for the first booklet, 339 (87%) for the second,
320 (82%) for the third, and 269 (68%) for the fourth.

preferred topics with direct relevance to controlling
asthma symptoms.
CLINICAL OUTCOMES

difference over the study year between the education
and control group for all outcome measures, including
hospital admissions.
The effect of enhanced education was examined
among those who had been retained in clinic care at the
beginning of the study and those who had had a peak
flow meter on entry. In the study year there was a
significant reduction in hospital admissions among
those receiving education and retained in clinic care.
The mean number of hospital admissions

admissions for patients retained in clinic care and
receiving enhanced education were 54% (95% confi-

CHANGES IN SYMPTOMS
A total of688 patients responded to at least one ofthe
questionnaires.
Non-respondents
were significantly younger (mean difference 13-3 (10 1

difference 25-3 (0 9 to 51'5)). Response rates did not,
however, differ significantly between the education
group (88%) and the control group (86%). Forty three
per cent (292/677) of patients in the study never
reported sleep disturbance at their reviews during the
study year, while 7% (45/677) always reported that
their sleep had been disturbed every night in the week
before their appointment. Similarly, 70% of patients
(445/635) never reported limitation in their activity
over the study. Analysis showed that education did not
have a significant effect on either ofthese distributions.

Discussion
The personalised, computer supported education
evaluated in this study was associated with a reduction
in hospital admissions among the patients judged most
vulnerable on entry to the study. When time
educated patients was taken into account this reduction
in risk of admission was found across all patients in the
indication
decreased morbidity. These findings agree with those
of other studies. For instance, intensive interventions

morbidity.'3-'7 However, such interventions
typical of normal clinic practice. Yoon found that only
31% of patients who expressed an interest in attending
admission actually did So.17 Asthma clinics run by
general practitioners or clinic based "asthma schools"
have produced improvements in morbidity among a
more general and representative patient population,
but these use more patient and stafftime than the usual
review process. Although consultations with general
practitioners fell among patients attending one British
the reduction was
consultations with the asthma nurse, and participation
in the clinic tended to decline.6 In an American study,
two initial sessions of one hour with a nurse educator
were followed by a 12 month "open door" programme
which encouraged patients to telephone or contact
clinic staff if they had questions between clinic visits;
patients were also interviewed an unspecified number
of times during the study and asked to keep asthma
diaries. This intensive approach resulted in a reduction
in hospital admissions among 104 patients with a
history ofmultiple admissions for asthma.7
The present study was not an intensive intervention
of the kind described above. It took the pragmatic
approach of giving written information to a general
clinic population. This approach, in the past, has
improved knowledge but has failed to have any effect
on clinical outcomes.23 Our programme of personalised booklets showed beneficial effects on hospital
admission and in the number of disturbed nights and
days of restricted activity among patients without a
peak flow meter on entry to the study. Our intervention differed from previous programmes by tailoring written material to individual patients, encouraging
questions and criticisms, and focusing on the management of symptoms rather than general knowledge of
The improvement in outcome could be due to
improved pulmonary function, enhanced confidence,
or changes in response to severe exacerbations. The
reduction in days of restricted activity and disturbed
nights suggests that a real improvement in morbidity
occurred among the "educated" patients. The differences between education and control groups cannot be
attributed to differences in ownership of peak flow
meters, which were equally distributed in the groups
and showed no benefit in combination with education.
Patients themselves valued most highly the sections
of the booklets that gave them objective advice about
the action to take when they felt breathless. The most
popular topics were "what to do in a serious asthma
attack" (73%), "good breathing" (68%), and "your
own relief medication" (67%). These results suggest
that the booklets made patients aware of warning signs
and reinforced advice and management instructions on
controlling symptoms. The importance of clear written
instructions and personal management plans has been
shown in other studies.8 19 The use of a computer to
integrate education material with personal management plans was important to the success of this
programme. This allowed a large and rather impersonal
intervention to take on some of the features of a small
group programme in linking education to personal
management.
