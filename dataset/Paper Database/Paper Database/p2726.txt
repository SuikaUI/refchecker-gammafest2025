Series Foreword
This series in learning, development, and conceptual change includes
state-of-the-art reference works, seminal book-length monographs, and
texts on the development of concepts and mental structures. It spans
learning in all domains of knowledge, from syntax to geometry to the
social world, and is concerned with all phases of development, from
infancy through adulthood.
The series intends to engage such fundamental questions as:
The nature and limits of learning and maturation: the influence of the
environment, of initial structures, and of maturational changes
in the nervous system on human development; learnability
theory; the problem of induction; domain-specific constraints on
development.
The nature of conceptual change: conceptual organization and conceptual change in child development, in the acquisition of expertise, and in the history of science.
