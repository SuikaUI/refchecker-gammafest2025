ABSTRACT In recent years, researches are concentrating on the effectiveness of Transfer Learning (TL)
and Ensemble Learning (EL) techniques in cervical histopathology image analysis. However, there have
been very few investigations that have described the stages of differentiation of cervical histopathological
images. Therefore, in this article, we propose an Ensembled Transfer Learning (ETL) framework to
classify well, moderate and poorly differentiated cervical histopathological images. First of all, we have
developed Inception-V3, Xception, VGG-16, and Resnet-50 based TL structures. Then, to enhance the
classiﬁcation performance, a weighted voting based EL strategy is introduced. After that, to evaluate the
proposed algorithm, a dataset consisting of 307 images, stained by three immunohistochemistry methods
(AQP, HIF, and VEGF) is considered. In the experiment, we obtain the highest overall accuracy of 97.03%
and 98.61% on AQP staining images and poor differentiation of VEGF staining images, individually. Finally,
an additional experiment for classifying the benign cells from the malignant ones is carried out on the Herlev
dataset and obtains an overall accuracy of 98.37%.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cervical cancer is one of the malignant tumors, with a high
incidence in women. It is also the fourth leading cause of
cancer-related deaths. It poses a serious risk to women’s
health and can spread through direct or distant metastasis .
In developing countries, it is the second most prevalent malignancy after breast cancer and the third dominant cause of
cancer-related deaths after breast and lung cancer . Moreover, developing countries are more vulnerable to prevent
cancer deaths because of a lack of awareness and adequate
medical facilities, which leads to nearly 90% of cervical

cancer-related deaths . Though the occurrence of cervical
cancer in developing nations has decreased in current times,
the percentage among young women grows . Therefore,
it is essential to make a precise diagnosis for the detection
of early-stage cancer, as well as reliable techniques, which
are primarily demand . Even though there are some preliminary tests and non-invasive methods for detecting cancer
in various organs, studies of histopathological images for
detecting the cancer are inevitable. Therefore, accurate and
rapid analysis of histopathological images plays a vital role
in medical research . A pathologist who can analyze the
histological images needs to go through a rigorous training
process and demands full concentration, including the time
to analyze the samples. Besides, the accuracies are greatly

varied from person to person. Additionally, the investigation
is a very subjective and uncertain process, which brings unstable diagnostic efﬁciency . In this regard, a Computer Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) system can help the doctor to track the
cancer of histopathological images with signiﬁcant accuracy
and efﬁciency.
As discussed earlier, the histopathological study in the
ﬁeld of cervical cancer is considered as the ‘‘gold standard’’
in clinical diagnosis . However, the applications of CAD
techniques for cervical cancer are still emerging and require
in-depth development of research . To this end, this article
focuses on the Cervical Histopathology Image Classiﬁcation (CHIC) problem by using CAD systems to solve three
distinct stages of classiﬁcation using an Ensembled Transfer
Learning (ETL) framework. The workﬂow of the suggested
ETL method is shown in Fig. 1.
In Fig. 1, the acquired microscopic images for cervical
cancer are employed as training samples. Notably, the images
are stained using three immunohistochemistry approaches
(AQP, HIF, and VEGF). Then, due to the inadequate
dataset for deep learning training, augmentation operation
is performed to enhance the classiﬁcation performance.
Thirdly, four Transfer Learning (TL) approaches are built
up for the classiﬁcation, including Inception-V3, Xception,
VGG-16, and Resnet-50 networks. Fourthly, an Ensemble
Learning (EL) technique, is further implemented to obtain
a more accurate classiﬁcation result with a weighted voting
approach. Finally, the test images are utilized to evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, where we calculate the
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
The main contributions with novelties of this study are
given as follows:
(1) A state of the art approach for analyzing the cervical histopathological images is presented in this study.
To the best of our knowledge, besides our previous
work – , there have been very few studies on the
differentiation stage of cervical histopathology images
(2) A new EL approach is introduced: In order to prevent
the unicity and limitation of the classiﬁcation results by a

single learner, we use four Convolution Neural Network
(CNN) for experiments, and then adopt the weighted
voting based EL method. Through multiple comparison
experiments, we ﬁnd that precision is an optimal choice
for weighting in this work.
(3) A series of valuable data is achieved: We do the comparative experiments of the individual TL and the EL, proving
the feasibility of our method.
The structure of the paper is as follows: Sec. II introduces
the related work about the CHIC. Sec. III gives an overview
of the proposed EL method, including TL using the Xception,
Inception-V3, VGG-16 and Resnet-50 networks, and the proposed weighted voting based approach. Sec. IV elucidates the
experimental results, including the evaluation and analysis
of the proposed method. Sec. V concludes this paper and
discusses the future work.
II. RELATED WORK
A. RELATED WORK IN MEDICAL FIELDS
In , an overview on the staging diagnosis of uterine
tumors on MRI images is described. The paper of ﬁnds
that the discrete compactness is a reproducible parameter
for a computer assisted quantiﬁcation of the invasion front
pattern and it may be a phenotypic feature of cervical cancer
cells. In , a research on feature quantiﬁcation and abnormal detection of cervical cells is proposed, which realizes
the detection and identiﬁcation of individual cancer cells.
First, normal and abnormal cells are distinguished by the
differences in the shapes of cytoplasm and nuclei. After that,
afﬁnity propagation algorithm is implemented for further
analysis on the detected abnormal cells. Finally, the grading
accuracy of abnormal cells is 76.47%. In , a method
for automatic detection of images of cervical cancer cells
captured from thin liquid based cytology slides is proposed,
a two-level cascade classiﬁer is developed to obtain the
dimensional features in morphology and texture. The system
classiﬁes 20000 cells, where the ﬁnal recognition rate is
95.642%, and the false negative rate and false positive rate
are 1.44%, respectively. In , a machine learning model
with a cross-validation algorithm for the cervical cytology
image is created. In clinical practice, the examinations for
diagnosing cervical cancer include medical imaging examinations, tumor biomarker detection, and HPV DNA testing.
The diagnosis of cervical cancer depends on the analysis
of pathologists by observing pap smear or biopsy samples,
which is an expensive method. This involves examining the
abnormal cell level of samples and determining the spread of
abnormal cells . In , cancer is classiﬁed according to
the spread of abnormal cells, which is a tedious, subjective,
and time-consuming process.
B. RELEVANT CLASSICAL WORKS IN THE CAD FIELD
In , CAD techniques for tissue slice image analysis
are summarized. The paper of carries out automatic
nuclei detection, segmentation, and feature calculation of the
cervical images. In , the functions of the envisioned
CAD system for colposcopy are described, and modular and
suggests open system design for image analysis by providing
a framework and foundation for the CAD system of cervical
cancer. The paper of proposes a prototype automated
CAD system for the diagnosis of CIN using ultra-large virtual
slides of cervical cancer, the segmentation achieves an average accuracy more than 94.25%. The work of reports on
methodologies and outcomes of a study aiming at developing
robust tool to evaluate and classify histology images of cervical cancer, by using the histology images acquired from the
pathology laboratories in an Indonesian hospital to classify
cervical biopsy images based on four well known discriminatory features. The paper of uses k-means clustering,
Gabor wavelet transform, graph cutting, color segmentation
algorithms, cellular morphological methods, and binary tree
algorithms are used to classify epithelial cells and stromal
cells in the histopathological images of cervical cancer. At the
same time, a computer aided decision support system tool is
presented to help pathologists in their examination of cervical
cancer biopsies. The main aim of the proposed system is
to identify abnormalities and quantify cancer grading in a
systematic and repeatable manner. The result shows that the
speciﬁcity of k-means, Gabor wavelet, and Hybrid Graph cut
and colour segmentation methods in CAD is 80%, 87%, and
97%, respectively. The paper of develops an automated
CIN grade classiﬁcation of vertical segmented epithelium
regions, and explores a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
and Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) for CIN
classiﬁcation showing exact grade labeling accuracy as high
as 90%. In , an automated approach for detecting cervical
cancer is proposed. The Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix
(GLCM) is used to divide the image into ten vertical images to
extract texture features. Then, using k-means clustering and
Marker control watershed algorithm to segment the image.
Finally, based on the texture and lesion area features, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is used to recognize
cervical cancer, and 90% accuracy is obtained. In our previous work , a TL framework for Inception-V3 network
is proposed. First, the images are augmented by using data
rotation and mirroring. Then, a TL method based on the
Inception-V3 network is constructed to extract deep learning
features. Finally, the extracted features are designed for the
ﬁnal classiﬁcation. In the result, an average accuracy of
77.3% is achieved. In another work , we suggest a multilayer hidden conditional random ﬁelds (MHCRFs) to classify
well, moderate and poorly differentiation stages of cervical
cancer, and an accuracy of 88% is obtained on a practical
histopathological image dataset with more than 100 AQP
stained samples. Meanwhile, in , a novel MHCRFs based
cervical histopathology image classiﬁcation model is proposed to classify well, moderate, and poorly differentiated
stages of cervical cancer using a weakly supervised learning
strategy. In , we utilize graph and unsupervised learning
methods in a tissue structure clustering task, and divide the
histopathological images of cervical cancer into sparse areas

and viscose areas to predict the risk of the tissues. For more
information, please refer to our previous survey papers .
C. RELEVANT DEEP LEARNING WORKS IN THE CAD FIELD
In recent years, deep learning approaches show a robust
development trend in the cervical cancer image classiﬁcation
ﬁeld. For instance, the paper of introduces a method for
the diagnosis of histopathological images of cervical cancer
using SVM and Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN). In ,
a superpixel and CNN based segmentation method for cervical cancer cells is proposed with an accuracy of 94.50%.
In , the author introduces a computerized technique to
distinguish normal and abnormal cervical cells using deep
ANN and a learning vector quantization algorithm. As a
development of , an ANN algorithm to extract new features of cervical cells is proposed, providing a classiﬁcation method for cervical smear examination using the ANN,
and comparing it with k-means and Bayesian classiﬁers.
In our recent work , we propose an ETL framework
to classify well, moderately and poorly differentiated cervical histopathology images based on VGG-16 and Inception-
V3 networks followed by an early fusion approach, using a
practical dataset with 100 VEGF stained cervical histopathology images, an average accuracy of 80% is ﬁnally achieved.
Meanwhile, in , we introduce ensemble learners of multiple deep CNNs for pulmonary nodule classiﬁcation using
CT images obtained from the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI)
database, and achieve prediction accuracy of 84.0%. Based
on the methods mentioned above, we carry out a series of
contrast experiments in Sec. IV-F, Table. 6.
Over the last few years, CAD techniques for cervical
histopathological images are focusing on practicing classical
and machine learning feature extraction approaches for segmentation and pathologic abnormality screening. However,
there has been a minimal contribution to the differentiation of
cervical histopathological images. At the same time, our ETL
approach has shown an average performance on pulmonary
CT and histopathological image analysis. Hence, based on
these research points, we develop a new ETL method in this
III. METHOD
A. TRANSFER LEARNING
ANN is one of the primary tools employed in machine learning. It consists of input and output layers, as well as (in most
cases) hidden layers consisting of units that transform the
input into something that the output layer can use. The input
data enters the neural network and comes to the hidden layer.
After the activation function, we get the ﬁnal output. The deep
ANN usually refers to an ANN with more than two hidden
layers .
Transfer Learning (TL) is a method that uses ANNs
pre-trained on a large annotated image database (such as
ImageNet) to complete various tasks. TL focuses on storing

knowledge gained in solving a problem and applying it to
different but related problems. It essentially uses additional
data so that ANNs can decode by using the features of past
experience training, after that the ANNs can have better generalization ability . With TL technology, we can directly
use pre-trained deep learning models that are trained through
a large number of readily available datasets. Then, ﬁnd out
the layer that can be reused. Finally, we can use the output of
these layers as the input to train a network with fewer parameters and smaller scales. This small-scale network only needs
to understand the internal relationships of speciﬁc problems,
and learns the patterns contained in the data through the
pre-trained models .
In this paper, we have compared the VGG series, Inception series, and Resnet series. The ﬁnal selection is based
on the comprehensive classiﬁcation performance and number of parameters. We ﬁnally apply Inception-V3 ,
Xception , VGG-16 and Resnet-50 networks for
the TL process, where the parameters are pre-trained on the
ImageNet dataset . For these four networks, the settings
of the hyperparameters are shown in Table. 1. Among them,
the learning rate uses decay learning rate, and the decay_steps
is 5, the decay_rate is 0.1. Fig. 2 shows an example of the
feature maps extracted by these four TL networks, where the
TL method can obtain some representative information from
the images.
B. ENSEMBLE LEARNING
Ensemble learning (EL) is the strategic generation and combination of multiple models, such as classiﬁers or experts,
to solve particular computational intelligence problems .
EL is primarily used to improve the performance (e.g., classi-
ﬁcation, prediction, and function approximation) of a model,
or reduce the likelihood of an unfortunate selection of a poor
one. Other applications of EL include assigning conﬁdence
to the decision made by the model, selecting optimal (or near
optimal) features, data fusion, incremental learning, nonstationary learning, and error-correcting .
The combination of learners may provide beneﬁts in terms
of statistics, computation and representation. In this paper,
the EL adopts the weighted voting based method. Its integration includes T base learners {h1, h2, h3, . . . , hT }, where the
output of hi on example x is hi(x). Particularly, in this paper,
we select four TL methods, so T = 4. The learner hi predicts a label from the set of category labels {c1, c2, . . . , cN},
the predicted output of hi on example x is represented as

including classiﬁcation accuracy, recall, precision, and
F1-score. Finally, as the recall to be the weight achieves the
best classiﬁcation result, we select it as the weight in this
IV. EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS
A. IMAGE DATASET
To test the effectiveness of the proposed ETL method in this
paper, a practical histopathology image dataset of cervical
cancer tissue sections is applied. The detailed information
about this dataset is as follows.
Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University provide
image samples and give image-level labels;
Staining method: Immunohistochemical (IHC) Staining,
including AQP, HIF, and VEGF approaches;
Magniﬁcation: 400×;
Microscope: Nikon (Japan);
Acquisition software: NIS-Elements F 3.2;
Image size: 1280 × 960 pixels;
Image format: *.png;
Image bits per pixel depth: 3 × 8 = 24.
Image category and morphological characteristics: There
are 307 images in the dataset, where 33 are well differentiated, 35 are moderate differentiation, and 28 are poor
differentiation of AQP staining; 39 are well differentiation,
38 are moderately differentiation, and 34 are poor differentiation of HIF staining; 29 are well differentiation, 33 are
moderately differentiation, and 38 are poor differentiation of
VEGF staining.
• Well differentiation: The tumor cells are closer to normal
cells, cell heteromorphism is relatively small, cell size
and morphology are similar.
• Moderate differentiation: Most cancer cells are concentrated in moderate differentiation. The characteristic is
between well differentiation and poor differentiation of
cervical cancer cells.
• Poor differentiation: The cell structure is not visible, and
the parts are disordered.
Among them, the well differentiated tumor cells are the least
malignant, the poorly differentiated tumor cells have the
malignancy,
moderately

differentiated tumor cells are moderately malignant .
An example of this dataset is shown in Fig. 3.
B. DATA AUGMENTATION
Data augmentation adds value to the underlying data by transforming the information inside the dataset. Since the total
number of sample datasets is too small (only 307), the neural
network trained on the small dataset is prone to over-ﬁtting.
So, we use the data augmentation technique to enhance the
original data set. The increasing training set can improve
the generalization ability of the neural networks, as well as
help the neural networks to learn some features with scale,
rotation, and color invariance, thus improving the prediction
performance of the classiﬁer.
We use data rotation and mirroring to augment our images.
For each sample picture xi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, n is the total number of pictures in a sample set X, we ﬁrst divide it into 9 equalsized sub-images z(i,j), i = 1, 2, . . . , n, j = 1, 2, . . . , 9. Then
we use the mirror edge padding to ﬁll in the sub-images of
equal length and width, and obtain the image z′
(i,j). For each
(i,j), we apply two data augmentation operations: In the ﬁrst
operation, we rotate each image into 0◦, 90◦, 180◦and 270◦;
In the second operation we do the horizontal ﬂipping, vertical
ﬂipping, and channel ﬂipping. So that each sub-image z′
can generate 16 images, where the image labels are the same

as the original image xi. Hence, each sample image xi is
augmented to 144 images. Finally, the size of the data set is
increased from 307 to 44208 after data augmentation. Our
images have a small ﬁeld of view, and most of them are
cancer regions with a single stage of differentiation when they
are prepared. Therefore, we make the patch label inherit the
image-level label.
C. EXPERIMENTAL SETTING
Histopathological images are usually noisy. However,
the proposed technique is a deep learning based approach,
which provides feature detection and extraction automatically . Therefore, the proposed method does not
need a noise reduction step. In the experiment, the augmented 44208 images are applied to examine the proposed
EL method. The training set, validation set, and test set
are divided according to the ratio of 8 : 1 : 1 as shown
in Table. 2. In order to make full use of the dataset, we randomly select 80% of the data set as the training set, and
then randomly select 50% from the remainder of the dataset
as the validation set, and the rest of the data as the test
D. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
The performance of the classiﬁers is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The accuracy
is the ratio of the number of samples correctly classiﬁed by
the classiﬁer to the total number of samples. The precision
reﬂects the proportion of the positive samples that are determined by the classiﬁer to be positive samples. The recall rate
reﬂects the positive case of correct judgment accounting for
the proportion of the total positive samples and the F1-score is
an indicator that comprehensively considers the accuracy and
the recall . Table. 3 describes these performance metrics.
In this paper, the samples of the categories studied at this time
are positive samples, and the samples of other categories are
negative samples.
As shown in Table. 3, TP is the True Positive (positive
sample is predicted to be positive), TN is the True Negative
(negative sample is predicted to be negative), FP is the False
Positive (negative sample is predicted to be positive), and
FN is the False Negative (positive sample is predicted to be
negative).

E. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
1) EVALUATION OF THE TL AND ETL RESULT
We use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate
the TL and the proposed ETL method. Especially, we carry
out 9-fold cross-validation to obtain an overall balanced evaluation on the IHC dataset (each staining method 3-folds), and
the results are shown in Table. 4. The results are analyzed
in three aspects: differentiation stage (well, moderate, and
poor differentiation), staining method (AQP, HIF, and VEGF
staining), and experimental method (TL and ETL method).
For the ﬁrst aspect: Differentiation stage (well, moderately,
and poor differentiation). It can be seen from Table. 4 that
the poor differentiation stage achieves the best classiﬁcation
accuracy on all TL methods and the ETL method. Furthermore, this stage also achieves the best classiﬁcation results on
precision and F1-score among others. For recall, the moderate
differentiation stage achieves the best classiﬁcation results
on all TL methods and the ETL method except the VGG-
16 TL approach. As for the VGG-16 TL method, the poor
differentiation stage achieves the best classiﬁcation results.
Moreover, all evaluation indexes of the proposed ETL method
have higher values than those of the individual TL method.
On the whole, the poor differentiation stage achieves the best
classiﬁcation results among the three differentiation stages,
and the proposed ETL method has the best classiﬁcation
performance.
For the second aspect: The staining method (AQP, HIF, and
VEGF staining). It is observed from Table. 4 that for accuracy,
the VEGF staining method obtains the best classiﬁcation
results among all TL methods and the ETL method except
Resnet-50 network. As for the Resnet-50 network, the HIF
staining technique achieves the best classiﬁcation results. For
precision, the VEGF staining algorithm achieves the best
classiﬁcation results compared to other TL methods and the
ETL method. Furthermore, the VEGF staining method also
achieves the best classiﬁcation results on F1-score of all. For
recall, the AQP staining technique achieves the best classiﬁcation results on Inception-V3 and Xception TL methods and
the ETL method. As for VGG-16 TL approach, the VEGF
staining algorithm achieves the best classiﬁcation results, and
the HIF staining technique achieves the best classiﬁcation
results for ResNet-50. Moreover, the proposed ETL method
has a higher value than those of the individual TL method.
Overall, the VEGF staining system achieves the best distribution results among the three staining approaches.

TABLE 5. The overall accuracy of De-novo trained CNNs, TL methods and
ETL method. The first row shows three staining methods. (In [%].)
For the third aspect: Experimental method (De-novo
trained CNNs, TL and ETL method). Table. 5 exhibits the
overall performance of the proposed techniques. It can be
seen from the table that the accuracy of each TL algorithm is about 1% to 3% higher than the method of training
models from scratch (De-novo trained CNNs). At the same
time, each transfer training process saves about 4 hours than
the De-novo trained CNNs. This understanding recommends
training CNNs using TL. Finally, it is observed that the
advanced ETL technique has higher correctness than any of
the single TL methods, which proves that the sophisticated
ETL approach has the best classiﬁcation performance.
2) VISUALIZED ANALYSIS
In order to show the classiﬁcation performance of the proposed model more intuitively, we exhibit confusion matrix
and loss curve for a visualized analysis. As shown in Fig. 4
and Fig. 5, the ETL method has low probability of error
classiﬁcation, and the ETL method has higher stability. The
accuracy and loss curve of training and validation sets are
shown in Fig. 6. It is clear to see from the curve that the
VGG-16 and Resnet-50 networks are more stable.
Moreover, the histogram of the individual TL and EL with
their accuracy is provided. As shown in Fig. 7, after EL,
the accuracy of well, moderate, and poorly differentiated
is increased. For well differentiation classiﬁcation results,
the accuracy of AQP staining is improved by 1.66%, HIF
staining is increased by 0.75%, and VEGF staining is
increased by 1.74% compared with the highest accuracy
of single TL classiﬁcation. For moderate differentiation,
the accuracy of AQP staining is risen by 1.23%, HIF staining
by 0.32% and VEGF staining by 2.16% compared with TL.
Similarly, for the poor differentiation, AQP staining, HIF
staining and VEGF staining improved by 1.3%, 0.18% and
0.42%, respectively. It is worth noting that compared with
the highest accuracy of single TL classiﬁcation, the overall
accuracy of AQP staining increased by 2.10%, HIF staining
by 0.63%, and VEGF staining by 2.15%. Above all, the effectiveness of the EL strategy is proved.

staining methods of VGG-16 network.
Finally, Fig. 8 exhibits the output of our recommended
algorithms. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that the correctly
predicted images have full information about the stage of
differentiation, so they are easy to distinguish. The wrongly
predicted images contain little information about the stages
of differentiation of tumor cells. Furthermore, in the data
augmentation process, we use image padding, which may
add redundant information. These reasons can disturb the
computer to classify the differentiation stages of cervical
cancer histopathology microscopic images.

In our previous work, different methods are introduced to
classify well, moderate and poorly differentiated cervical

histopathological images. In order to show the performance
of the proposed ETL method in this paper, we compare it
with the TL method based on Inception-V3, the ETL method
based on VGG-16 and Inception-V3, the method based on
multi-layer hidden conditional random ﬁeld and the methods
combining classical features with SVM, ANN, and Random
Forests (RF) classiﬁers respectively. The classical features
include Scale-invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), GLCM,
Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), and color histogram
features. In Table. 6, all the comparison methods and results
mentioned above are summarized.
As shown in Table. 6, the accuracy of the single TL
method is about 30% higher than the average accuracy
of the classical method. The accuracy of the ETL method 
is 2.7% higher than the single TL method. However, our
proposed method achieves the highest accuracy of 98.61%
among all the methods, and the accuracy is 10.61% higher
than the second , , showing the effectiveness of our
ETL method in this paper.
G. COMPUTATIONAL TIME
Finally, we describe the computational time of our proposed
ETL method. In our experiment, we use a workstation with
Intel® CoreTM i7-7700 CPU with 3.60 GHz, 32 GB RAM,
and GeForce GTX 1080 8GB. The training time for each
staining method is about 8.5 hours, and the test time of each
staining method is about 5 seconds. Although the training
time takes more time, the test time costs only a few seconds,
showing the feasibility of our proposed ETL method.
H. ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT
1) IMAGE DATASET
In order to evaluate the generalization ability of the proposed
ETL method, a publicly available Herlev dataset is
employed, which is a cytopathological image set for cervical
cells. This dataset includes 917 single-cell images, where
242 images belong to a benign class and 675 images belong
to a malignant class. According to experimental setting of
the existing work, the training, validation, and test sets are
divided according to the ratio of 3: 1: 1. So, the number of
benign cells in these three datasets is 144, 49, and 49 respectively, while the number of malignant cells in these three
datasets is 405, 135, and 135 respectively. To solve the problem of the unbalanced dataset, the benign cell images in the
training set and the validation set are augmented. First, each
original image is rotated by 180◦and ﬂipped by a mirror.
Then, the images of benign cells with the same number of
malignant cells are randomly selected as the training and
validation sets. An example of the Herlve dataset is shown
in Fig. 9.

2) PERFORMANCE COMPARISON BETWEEN TL
AND ETL METHODS
The TL and ETL methods are used for binary classiﬁcation on
the Herlev dataset . Their 3-fold cross-validation results
are shown in Table. 7.
From Table. 7 we can ﬁnd that among the single TL methods, the classiﬁcation performance of the Resnet-50 network
is the best, and the highest value of all evaluation indicators
is obtained. Among them, accuracy is 95.65%, which is
about 2.5% to 5.5% higher than other networks. Precision

is 96.35%, which is about 1.5% to 2.5% higher than other
networks. Recall is 97.78%, which is about 3% to 5% higher
than other networks. F1-score is 97.06%, which is about 1.8%
to 3.8% higher than other networks. However, it is worth
noting that the ETL method performs better than all the single
TL methods, obtaining an accuracy of 98.37%, a precision
of 98.53%, a recall of 99.26%, and a F1-score of 98.89%.
It shows that the ETL method proposed in this paper can
improve the performance of classiﬁcation on Herlev dataset
effectively.
3) PERFORMANCE COMPARISON BETWEEN ETL AND
OTHER EXISTING METHODS
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method,
a comparative analysis with existing work on Herlev dataset
is presented in Table. 8. For more details, please refer to our

Analysis’’ .
From the comparison Table. 8, we can ﬁnd that our proposed ETL method has a certain degree of competition in
accuracy and precision compared with the existing methods. These results validate the robustness of our proposed

algorithm, which is not only applicable for cervical
histopathological image analysis, but also suitable for cervical cytopathological images.
V. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, weighted voting based EL is proposed to
classify cervical histopathological images. Especially, three
cervical cancer differentiation stages are classiﬁed, where
the highest overall accuracy of 97.03% is achieved on AQP
staining method. Meanwhile, the highest accuracy of 98.61%
is achieved on poorly differentiated of VEGF staining. However, this method presents some deﬁciencies worthy to be
pointed out. Firstly, we use four base learners, it requires
a very sophisticated computer for its implementation and
presents very high computational cost, and it adds to the
workload as well. Secondly, there is no patient-level label
for our current IHC dataset, so this paper does not do basic
studies based on patients. At the moment, we are collecting
more data and working in this direction. In the future, we plan
to develop more efﬁcient and simple systems to do the classiﬁcation of cervical histopathology images.
