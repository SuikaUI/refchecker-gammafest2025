INTRODUCTION
Protein–chemical interactions are essential for any biological system; for example, they drive the metabolism of the
cell or initiate many signaling cascades and most pharmaceutical interventions. A large collection of such interactions can, therefore, be used to study a variety of
cellular functions and the impact of drug treatment on
the cell. For such research, it is important to have, as
complete as possible, data on protein–chemical interactions. By treating proteins and chemicals as nodes of a
graph, which are linked by edges if they have been found to
interact (1), we can adopt a network view that enables us to
integrate many different sources. The concept of STITCH
(‘search tool for interacting chemicals’) was from the beginning to combine sources of protein–chemical interactions
from experimental databases, pathway databases, drug–
target databases, text mining and drug–target predictions
into a uniﬁed network (2–4). This network abstracts the
complexity of the underlying data sources, making largescale studies possible. At the same time, links to the original
sources are retained, making it possible to trace the provenance of the data. The underlying STITCH database can
be accessed in multiple ways: via an intuitive web interface,
via download ﬁles (for large-scale analysis) and via an API
(enabling automated access on a small to medium scale).
Here, we present recent improvements to the database and
user interface of STITCH. Already in the previous
versions, it has been possible to query STITCH using
protein or chemical names, InChIKeys and SMILES
strings. New in this version is the possibility to upload
spreadsheets with chemical descriptors and experimental
data that can be directly added to the network, as described
later in text. We also for the ﬁrst time use the evidence

set of proteins, containing 1133 species. We updated the

set of chemicals (6), and ﬁnd interactions with 390 000
distinct chemicals. In human, high-conﬁdence interactions
for 172 000 compounds are available in STITCH 4
(Figure 1), compared with 110 000 in STITCH 3 (4). In
total, the human protein–chemical interaction network
contains 2.2 million interactions (Figure 1). Applying
different conﬁdence thresholds, 570 000 interactions are
of medium conﬁdence (score cutoff 0.5) and 367 000 interactions are of high conﬁdence (cutoff 0.7).
SOURCES OF INTERACTIONS
Protein–chemical interactions are presented in four different channels: experiments, databases, text mining and predicted interactions. We import the following sources of
experimental information: ChEMBL [interactions with
reported Ki or IC50 (7)], PDSP Ki Database (8), PDB
(9) and—new to STITCH—data from two large-scale
studies on kinase–ligand interactions (10,11). From the
latter studies, we extracted 74 291 interactions between
229 compounds and 414 human kinases. We converted
the reported residual kinase activities (10) and kinase
afﬁnities (11) to probabilistic scores, which gave rise to
14 187, 9431 and 5977 interactions of at least low,
medium and high conﬁdence, respectively. The second
channel is made up of manually curated drug–target databases: DrugBank (12), GLIDA (13), Matador (14), TTD
(15) and CTD (16); and pathway databases: KEGG (17),

PREDICTION OF INTERACTIONS
STITCH contains veriﬁed interactions (from the sources
listed earlier in text) and predicted interactions, based
on text mining and other prediction methods. In the textmining channels, interactions were extracted from the literature using both co-occurrence text mining and Natural
Language Processing (21,22). For the ﬁrst time for
STITCH, we not only use data from MEDLINE abstracts
and OMIM (23) but also from full-text articles freely available from PubMed Central or publishers’ Web sites.
In previous versions, we have used medical subject
headings (MeSH) terms in text mining and when importing external databases. These terms allowed us to expand
concepts like ‘alpha adrenergic receptors’ to individual
proteins. We used to map MeSH terms to proteins using
a combination of automatic and manual approaches,
which led to errors in some cases. Furthermore, the
mapping was only valid for human proteins. We have,
therefore, started to use terms from the Gene Ontology
[GO terms, (24)] to deﬁne groups of proteins. We excluded
GO annotations based on mutant phenotypes (IMP) and
electronic
annotations
coverage of GO annotations for all species in STITCH.
We only mapped GO terms to proteins for species
where at least 10% of the proteins have been annotated,
namely Drosophila melanogaster, Escherichia coli, Homo
sapiens, Mus musculus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
As the coverage of synonyms is lower than for MeSH
terms, we manually added additional synonyms to GO
Figure 1. Cumulative distribution of scores. For each conﬁdence score threshold, the plot shows the number of chemicals (top) and protein–chemical
interactions (bottom) that have at least this conﬁdence score in the human protein–chemical network. For example, there are 172 000 chemicals with
a high-conﬁdence interaction (score at least 0.7). As there are many interactions with low conﬁdence scores, we use a minimum score threshold of
0.15. Steps in the data correspond to large numbers of compounds that have the same maximum score in manually curated databases or the
ChEMBL database (with different conﬁdence levels).

terms to increase the text-mining sensitivity. As one GO
term corresponds to multiple proteins, the resulting conﬁdence score for the individual protein–chemical interactions
down-weighted
interactions that are directly associated with a single
protein. We, therefore, determined a correction factor
through benchmarking (as a function of the number of
member proteins in the GO term). For each channel, we
looked at the GO terms that are interacting with chemicals.
We then checked if the member proteins that are part of the
GO terms are in turn interacting with chemicals. For each
of these chemicals, we determined the fraction of member
proteins that are interacting. For example, if a drug was
known to bind two of the three a2-adrenergic receptors, it
was added as a data point (x = 3, y = 2/3) to the benchmark data. The data points were then ﬁtted for each
channel by the following function:
ð Þ ¼ x  a
For larger groups, the function approaches x1 (i.e. interacting with one protein is not predictive for the other
proteins).
In this version of STITCH, we introduced a fourth
channel, namely predicted protein–chemical interactions
based on chemical structure. Countless articles on the prediction of drug–target interactions have been published in
the last years [e.g. (25–27), reviewed in (28)]. In many cases,
however, the actual predictions are not available. We,
therefore, implemented a relatively simple and transparent
prediction scheme based on Random Forests (29,30): for
each target for which >100 binding partners are known
from the ChEMBL database, we attempted to make a prediction. To avoid biases, we ﬁrst excluded highly similar
chemicals, enforcing a maximum Tanimoto similarity of
0.9 (using Algorithm 2 described by Hobohm) (31) using
2D chemical ﬁngerprints calculated with the chemistry development kit (32,33). We then added ten times as many
random chemicals as non-binders to the training set and
used the ﬁngerprints as predictors for all compounds.
Using 10-fold cross-validation, we assessed how predictive
the model is (by calculating the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between the training data and the cross-validation
results). We used the correlation as a correction factor to
decrease the conﬁdence score of the predicted interactions,
which were predicted for all compounds occurring in the
ChEMBL database. We repeated this procedure three
times for each compound and used the median predicted
score, to decrease the effect of the random negative set. As
interactions were predicted from the experimental channel,
the predictions and experimental channels are not independent of each other. To compute the combined score
(which is shown on the network), we therefore took the
highest of either score, instead of combining the scores in
a Bayesian fashion as it is done for the other channels.
In total, predictions were made for 767 proteins across
15 species. The median correlation between the training
data and the cross-validation prediction was 0.90.
Links between compounds were also extracted from the
aforementioned sources, if possible. (e.g. chemical reactions from pathway databases or co-mentioned chemicals
from text mining.) We also predicted shared mechanisms
of action from MeSH pharmacological actions, the
Connectivity Map using the DIPS method (34), which

Developmental Therapeutics Program NCI/NIH (35).
The latter screening data replaces our previous analysis
of the NCI60 panel. We considered only the 70 of 115
cell lines against which >10 000 compounds have been
screened and centered the negative logarithm of GI50
values with respect to both compounds and cell lines.
For the 47 692 compounds in the data set, we calculated
all-against-all covariance across cell lines and converted
these to probabilistic scores. This resulted in 114 072,
24 889 and 6890 pairs of compounds of at least low,
medium and high conﬁdence, respectively.
To account for the fact that many interactions are
determined in model species, we transfer interactions

similarity
between two proteins was used to determine the conﬁdence in the transferred score. This had the disadvantage
that when transferring evidence from a selective binder
(e.g. inhibiting only one subtype of a receptor), all
subtypes of the receptor in the target species would
receive a similar score. In the new scheme, only the

INTEGRATION WITH USER DATA
Users can now upload a spreadsheet (e.g. in Microsoft
Excel format) with experimental data to STITCH using
the ‘batch import’ functionality (Figure 2). For each
compound, the spreadsheet may contain: the name of
the compound, the chemical structure (as SMILES
string, InChI or InChIKey), an internal identiﬁer and a
readout value. STITCH uses the name and chemical structure to ﬁnd the compound in the STITCH database.
The name provided by the user can then be shown in
the interaction network, and the downloadable ﬁles
contain both the name and the user’s internal identiﬁer
(if provided). The readout value may be a numerical
value, e.g. the activity of a compound in a screen. The
user can then select a palette from the ColorBrewer2
color schemes (36). The palette is used to convert the numerical value into a color, which is then used to highlight
the compounds in the network with a colored halo
(Figure 3). It is also possible to directly specify colors
(in standard hexadecimal notation).
The majority of users access STITCH via the web interface, where networks can be retrieved using single or
multiple names of proteins or chemicals. Furthermore,
users can query STITCH with protein sequences and
chemical structures (in the form of SMILES strings).
The networks can then be explored interactively or
saved in different formats, including publication-quality
images. Proteins and chemicals can be clustered in the

ﬁrst ﬁve rows of the spreadsheet and ask the user to identify columns that contain the name, chemical structure or a numerical readout (b). Selected
columns are highlighted in green. STITCH uses heuristics to suggest which kind of information the columns contain, e.g. by identifying SMILES
strings as structural descriptors.

interactive network viewer and enriched GO terms among
the proteins can be computed (5,37). The set of all interactions is also available for download under Creative
Commons licenses (with separate commercial licensing
for a subset). In this way, STITCH can be used to drive
large-scale studies. Many research groups have already
used STITCH 3 in this way; a few examples illustrating
different utilities follow: STITCH has been used to determine which proteins cause side effects during drug treatment (38,39) by combining the STITCH network with
data from a side effect database (40). The database has
also been instrumental for the identiﬁcation of druggable
proteins to predict polypharmacological treatment of
diseases on the basis of network topology features (41).
For a method that predicts drug targets based on
chemogenetic assays in yeast, STITCH has been chosen
as a benchmark set (42). Lastly, STITCH has also been
integrated into other tools, for example ResponseNet2.0
and QuantMap (43,44).
