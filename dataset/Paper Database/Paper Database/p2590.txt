While only 20% of harvested lands are actually irrigated, 40% of global agricultural production originates from irrigated areas. Therefore, assessing irrigation requirements is essential
for the development of effective water-related policies for an efficient management of water
resources. Moreover, global-scale analyses are becoming increasingly relevant, motivated
by globalized production and international trade of food as well as by the need of common
strategies to address climate change.
In this study, a comprehensive model to estimate crop growth and irrigation requirements
of 26 main crops at global scale is presented. The model computes a soil water balance
using daily precipitation and reference evapotranspiration based on a high-resolution ERA5
reanalysis dataset from the European Copernicus Program. The irrigation requirement,
defined as the minimum water volume to avoid water stress, is computed for year 2000 at
the resolution of 5 arc-min (or 0.0833˚) and aggregated at different spatial and temporal
scales for relevant analyses.
The estimated global irrigation requirements for 962 km3 is described in detail, also in
relation to the spatial variability and to the monthly variation of the requirements. A focus on
different areas of the world (California, Northern Italy and India) highlights the wealth of information provided by the model in different climatic conditions.
National data of irrigation withdrawals have been used for an extensive comparison with
model results. A crop-specific validation has also been made for the State of California,
comparing model results with local data of irrigation volume and independent estimates of
crop water use. In both cases, we found a good agreement between model results and real
1. Introduction
Agriculture plays a main role in a world where population is expected to grow rapidly in the
next decades. Agriculture is the human activity which requires most of the withdrawn freshwater, with 20% of irrigated harvested lands providing 40% of global food production . Ensuring the availability of irrigation water to meet agricultural requirements is a primary concern
for the future of humanity, due to the difficulty of finding a balance between the increasing

needs for food production, threats due to climate change, and other human uses . The climate change is expected to produce a large-scale impact on all the human activities and our
mitigation strategies must match up the complexity of a globalized food production. Therefore, a global assessment of irrigation requirements is important to manage agricultural and
water resources at different spatial scales, investigate crop shifts and understand new
opportunities of global food trade for water conservation .
Along this study, the irrigation requirement is intended as the amount of water provided to
crops when precipitation does not entirely satisfy the evapotranspiration demand. A number
of high-resolution assessments of global irrigation requirements exist. The first ones were
based on WaterGAP , WATERSIM , LPJmL and H07 models, which mostly did
not consider multi-cropping practices (i.e. the sequence of multiple growing seasons on the
same area, e.g. “winter” and “spring” wheat) and provided little crop-specific results. The comparison in Table 1 shows that latest assessments are generally referred to year 2000, because of
the availability of crop-specific information of irrigated areas for that year. This is the case for
the GCWM , GEPIC , the assessment based on the CROPWAT model proposed by
FAO , and the WATNEEDS model .
Table 1 shows that the spatial resolution of global models has increased over the years,
mainly because of the release of crop-specific datasets of irrigated areas. With the exception of
Chiarelli et al. , who uses high-resolution daily precipitation, the previous models are
rarely based on daily data or they provide results on lower spatial resolutions (e.g. 1˚ in Hanasaki et al. ). The present study introduces new daily global data for both precipitation and
reference evapotranspiration, working on a high spatial resolution grid to best reproduce detail

within the global scale. The reference evapotranspiration was calculated with temperature
data, according to the Hargreaves-Samani method , and calibrated through global comparison with a widely used monthly dataset.
The introduction of hydroclimatic data from remote sensing has brought an important
improvement to global models. Satellites are increasingly designed and used for agricultural
applications , helping to identify irrigated lands and indirectly to estimate irrigation
volume . The European Copernicus Program, started in 2014 as a continuation of GMES
(Global Monitoring for Environment and Security), developed a system of satellites known as
Sentinel Constellation to continuously monitor the Earth environment .
The model presented in this study aims to assess global irrigation requirements exploiting
the potential of satellite products from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), in the
computation of a soil-water balance approach based on the FAO methodology . Model
application is limited to year 2000, in order to match available data of crop harvested areas and
growing periods. For year 2000, spatial coverage resulting from 26 main crops is provided by
the MIRCA2000 database. Our estimate of irrigation requirements has been compared both to
results of other models and to actual data from irrigation volumes on different spatial scales.
The assessment of irrigation requirements is based on data of agricultural areas equipped for
irrigation (AEI), and related calendars of growing periods. We used data from MIRCA2000
 which provides global gridded data on a 0.0833˚ spatial resolution (cell, or pixel, dimension of about 9x9 km at the Equator) for 26 different crops. The dataset includes information
about cropping intensity, i.e. the ratio between gross harvested area (hectares that are actually
harvested in one year, considering multiple growing seasons) and net sown area (area of the
agricultural fields). Growing periods are defined for temporary crops (i.e. those that are both
sown and harvested during the same year) on a monthly basis. In order to use this information
within a daily assessment, we assumed that sowing and harvest occur on the 16th and the 15th
day, respectively, of the given months, similarly to other studies (e.g. ). The length of a
growing season is then considered as the number of days between the sowing and harvest
dates. Growing periods for perennial crops (i.e. those that don’t need to be replanted every
year, like fruit trees) are defined by the green-up dates instead. Such dates are taken from Chapagain & Hoekstra and refer to the FAO agro-climatic zones system (GAEZ) .
2.1. Climate data
In this study we use the new global re-analysis dataset ERA5, released by Copernicus in 2018
 , which includes hourly climate data that combines satellite information and ground measurements for 1950-present at the spatial resolution of 0.25˚ (i.e. about 28 km at the Equator).
ERA5 is a global reanalysis product, based on a large number of hourly climate data sets, produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) as an
improvement over the previous ERA-Interim product (45 arc min, 6-hour temporal resolution). Climate data were downloaded through the Application Programming Interface (API)
of ECMWF and subsequently processed to match the MIRCA2000 spatial grid.
The two main climate variables used in this study are precipitation (P) and reference evapotranspiration (ET0). In order to obtain daily rainfall, hourly precipitation available in ERA5
was aggregated summing data from 1:00h to 0:00h in each day. The reference evapotranspiration (ET0), defined as the evapotranspiration rate [mm/day] from a hypothetical well-watered
grass surface with fixed characteristics ,was calculated using the Hargreaves-Samani

method . The expression for daily ET0 [mm/day] reads:
ET0;i ¼ kHS  Ra;i  Tmean;i þ 17:8
ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
Tmax;i   Tmin;i
where i is the specific day, Tmax,i, Tmin,i and Tmean,i are respectively the maximum, minimum
and mean daily temperatures [˚C] and Ra,i is the equivalent evaporation [mm], obtained by
dividing the top-of-atmosphere radiation by the latent heat of vaporization of water (1/λ =
0.408). The empirical coefficient kHS was initially fixed to 0.0023, as in the original formula
proposed by Hargreaves-Samani . All the variables required for the application of (1) were
taken from ERA5 and were aggregated on a daily scale. The top-of-atmosphere radiation
could be calculated using a geometric approach, but we choose to use the ERA5 product to be
consistent with the spatial grid of temperature data.
Although the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) method is a valid alternative to the mostly recommended Penman-Monteith (PM) method , we introduce a spatial variability of the kHS
coefficient, that is calibrated to provide consistency with the annual estimates from PM available in the CRU Time-Series global dataset . This procedure was developed according to
the monthly calibration described by Heydari et al. . The yearly HS evapotranspiration has
been upscaled on a 0.5˚ resolution to match the spatial grid of CRU. The kHS coefficient were
obtained by multiplying 0.0023 by the ratios between annual PM and HS reference evapotranspiration values. Finally, the kHS values were downscaled to match the MIRCA2000 grid, proportionally to the uncalibrated ET0 values in each pixel. The calibrated empirical coefficients
were used to calculate the daily ET0, according to (1).
2.2. Analysis of reference evapotranspiration
The daily ET0 from Eq (1) has been computed on the global grid of 0.0833˚ for the whole year
2000. The mean value of the calibrated kHS coefficients in Eq (1) was 0.0024 over the irrigated
cells, with a standard deviation of 0.0004. The calibration produced higher coefficients along
coastal and arid regions, which is consistent with the tendency of HS to underestimate ET0 in
these scenarios .
Results obtained have been compared with the PM reference evapotranspiration from CRU
Time-Series for the months of January and July, as shown in Fig 1. The scatter plots compare, on a global scale, the monthly ET0 from the PM and HS methods, in primarily cultivated
areas, i.e. in cells where the harvested portion is greater than 90% of the pixel’s area. The Pearson correlation index (R) between the two datasets is 0.987 for January (Fig 1a) and 0.978 for
Fig 1. Comparison between the CRU-TS v.4 ET0 (Penman-Monteith, monthly data) and the monthly average
ERA5-based Hargreaves-Samani ET0. The comparison was made considering all the cells around the world where the
harvested area is at least 90% of the pixel, for the months of January (a) and July (b).

July (Fig 1b). Similar results were obtained considering all the pixels with at least 1% of harvested area. This ensures that no substantial bias emerges from the monthly comparison.
The two ET0 from HS and PM have also been compared in every cell, grouping the results
by climate conditions. Fig 2 shows the boxplots over agro-climatic zones for the months of January (a) and July (b), according to the GAEZ thermal agro-classification . Zones are

obtained on the basis of climate data from CRU-TS according to the indications given by
Van Velthuizen et al. , and are shown in Fig 2d. The three levels in each boxplot show the
percentage differences corresponding to 25%, 50% and 75% of harvested areas in each climatic
zone. The asterisks indicate the area-weighted mean percentage difference. The pie chart in
Fig 2c shows the percentage of irrigated areas per climate region: tropics (24.5%), sub-tropics
summer rainfall (27.9%), sub-tropics winter rainfall (14.4%), temperate sub-continental
(28.6%); the sum of areas equipped for irrigation in the oceanic-temperate, continental temperate, boreal and arctic zones are less than 5%. Since 85.5% of total harvested areas are in the
northern hemisphere, in temperate regions January is mostly a winter month: this explains the
substantial negative differences found where the HS method is less effective due to low temperatures. On the other hand, HS and PM methods are more aligned on tropical (orange) and
sub-tropical regions (beige and yellow). Also the temperate sub-continental region (green),
that accounts the largest fraction of temperate areas, shows a good alignment during summer
and winter. In summary, except for a few isolated cases on tropical and temperate-continental
regions, we found monthly correlation indices between HS and PM typically higher than 0.8.
This is consistent with results from previous studies, where HS was found a reliable method
on a global scale and also with studies in arid and semi-arid regions where R reaches 0.97
Although ERA5 provides data of potential evapotranspiration, ETp (defined as the maximum amount of evaporation, under existing atmospheric conditions, from a surface of pure
water), this variable is the result of an energy-balance approach which is conceptually different from ET0. We have compared our results with this dataset, finding marked local differences, with annual rate of ET0 computed with HS being up to 25% lower than ETp, with winter
ETp being too large in central Asia and North America and with unclear low values in some
intensively harvested regions (central France, the Amazon, the Great Lakes region of the USA,
Myanmar, Laos, New Guinea). For these reasons, ETp is not recommended to be used in the
assessment of crop water requirements.
3. Methods
For assessing irrigation requirements on a global scale, a water balance model has been developed, improving the methodology proposed by Tuninetti et al. . The model calculates the
irrigation requirement using a soil-water balance on land equipped for irrigation, taking as
input the climatic data and the agricultural information described in the previous paragraphs.
We evaluated the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for each day, according to the FAO’s
approach , i.e.
ETa;i ¼ ET0;i  kc;i  ks;i;
where ET0 and ETa are expressed in mm/day, i is the specific day, kc is a dimensionless coefficient specific for each crop and growing phase (or crop coefficient), and ks is the water stress
coefficient, that takes values from 0 to 1.
When ks = 1, the evapotranspiration is not affected by water stress and reaches the maximum rate, named crop evapotranspiration (ETc). If ks = 0, the crop reaches the wilting point
because of the dry soil condition, and there is no evapotranspiration.
The study of Chapagain & Hoekstra provides the crop-specific information to divide
the growing period into four phases (initial, crop development, mid-season, late season) and
assigning daily crop coefficients. As described by Allen et al. , the crop coefficient remains
constant during the initial stage (kc = kc,ini). In the development stage, kc grows linearly from
kc,ini to kc,mid, i.e. the constant value of the coefficient in the mid-season stage, and finally, in
ERA5-based global assessment of irrigation requirement and validation

the late season stage, it decreases linearly from kc,mid to kc,end. This information is available for
the ten different climatic zones summarized in Fig 2 (based on the GAEZ thermal agro-classification ).
The water stress coefficient ks is calculated according to the FAO methodology , i.e.
if  Si  1   ri
Þ Sfc   Sw
if  Sw < Si < 1   ri
Þ Sfc   Sw
if  Si  Sw
In Eq (3), Si is the soil moisture [mm] in day i, calculated multiplying the water content [%]
and depth of the root zone [mm]. In the same equation, Sfc and Sw are the levels of soil moisture [mm] corresponding to field capacity (i.e. the maximum amount of water that can be
stored in soil after drainage by gravity action) and wilting point (i.e. the dry soil condition,
when crops do not have available water), respectively. The depletion fraction, ρi, is the percentage of total available water that can be used by a crop without reaching water stress. The term
(1 –ρi)Sfc, also known as Si
, is the soil moisture at incipient water stress or stomata closure
[mm]. According to the FAO methodology , the depletion fraction ρ of day i can be calculated as
ri ¼ rst þ 0:04 5   ETc;i
where ETc,i is the crop evapotranspiration in the absence of water stress [mm] and ρst is a
crop-specific standard value of the depletion fraction at ETc = 5mm/day. This expression is
related to the sensitivity of crops to weather conditions, as higher temperatures imply faster
stomata closure, in equal soil moisture conditions. The depletion fraction is found to vary in a
range between 0.1 and 0.8.
To apply Eq (3), we used the 30-arc-sec global dataset of available water capacity, i.e. the difference between field capacity and wilting point, from the Harmonized World Soil Database
by JRC .
We used the data from Allen et al. to set the maximum rooting depths for irrigated
lands: roots of temporary crops are supposed to increase linearly in the first two phases of the
growing period, from a sowing depth of 0.2 m, and then remain equal to the maximum value
for the rest of the season. Roots of perennial crops are supposed equal to the maximum length
for the entire year. In this way, the model calculates the actual available water for each day of
the growing period.
The daily soil-water balance expresses the variation of soil moisture in the root zone, calculated as a function of inputs and outputs:
Siþ1   Si ¼ Pi þ Ii   ETa;i   PSi;
In Eq (5), all variables are expressed in mm. Si is the soil moisture on day i and ranges
between field capacity and wilting point conditions (Sw  Si  Sfc); Si+1 is the soil moisture
resulting from the daily water balance, used as the initial condition on the following day; Pi is
precipitation; and ETa,i is the actual evapotranspiration, calculated according to Eq (2). During
dry periods, low rainfall may be insufficient to compensate for evapotranspiration and soil
moisture reaches the water stress level (S), the condition in which plants start to close their
stomata. The daily irrigation requirement, Ii, is defined as the water needed to avoid water
stress, the additional depth that guarantees Si  (1 –ρi)Sfc according to Eq (3). In the event that
daily precipitation brings soil moisture to field capacity, any further input of rainfall that

cannot be stored in the soil is called precipitation surplus, PSi. In Eq (5), this variable represents the sum of runoff and ground percolation. Since irrigated fields are usually almost horizontal, surface runoff and groundwater lateral movements in the root zone were considered
negligible: PSi is assumed equivalent to deep percolation.
On the sowing date of temporary crops, the initial soil moisture is assumed equal to field
capacity. For crops grown on paddy fields a specific hypothesis is required: an additional
depth of 200 mm is considered to saturate the soil before each sowing date, as suggested by the
FAO methodology . This water is not included in the estimation of rice irrigation requirement, because it is not directly used by the plants, and is explicitly reported in the results.
Considering that precipitation may occur in different hours of the day, even during the
night when evapotranspiration is negligible, we introduced a random assignment of input
rainfall, occurring before or after the calculation of ETa.
The model evaluates the irrigation requirement for each growing season in a cell. If a crop
is repeatedly cultivated on the same field, the final amount of I is the sum made for all seasons.
Instead, if the same crop is cultivated on different fields within the same cell, the final I for that
crop is the area-weighted average between the two requirements. The total volume of irrigation
requirement is calculated on a monthly or annual scale, considering the contribution of the 26
where V, Ic and AEIc are, respectively, the total irrigation requirement volume [m3], the irrigation requirement [mm] and the irrigated area [ha] for a specific crop c.
The averaged requirement considering the entire area of a cell is Igrid = V/(10 Agrid), computed as the ratio between the total volume [m3] of irrigation requirement and the area Agrid
[ha] of the 0.0833˚ grid cell: this is used here to compare irrigation requirements from different
regions in the world. The spatial variability of Igrid values is consistent with the actual distribution of irrigated areas and cropping intensities within cells.
4. Results
4.1. Global irrigation requirement
The model described above was applied using the climatic and agricultural data of year 2000,
and the global volume of irrigation requirement was estimated in 962 km3. Fig 3a shows the
spatial distribution of annual cell-averaged requirements (Igrid) and Fig 3b also shows the spatial distribution of cell-averaged precipitation surplus (PS).
Factors influencing the Igrid are the ratio between annual precipitation and the reference
evapotranspiration (i.e. the Budyko index), the temporal variability of these forcings (even in
wet regions a significant amount of irrigation may be required if the precipitation is strictly
seasonal), and the extension of AEI in each pixel of the grid. For example, in Bangladesh the
Budyko index is 1.5 but the high rainfall rate is concentrated in the monsoon season, and the
tropical high evapotranspiration quickly leads crops to water stress during dry periods: so we
found high Igrid. In the central and northern parts of Australia, the irrigation requirement is
typically higher than 900 mm/year, but the very low density of harvested areas keeps the cell
average Igrid below 1 mm/year (in this region, less than 0.1% of the territory is usually equipped
for irrigation). In arid and semi-arid regions we found high Igrid values (e.g. over 750 mm/year
in the Indo basin, over 800 mm/year in the Nile delta and over 720 mm/year in California)
and negligible precipitation surplus due to the lack of precipitation. In many European and

American temperate regions, high Igrid levels usually depend more on AEI density than on climate conditions. For instance, Italy’s northern Po Valley requires much more irrigation than
southern territories: despite south of Italy is typically drier, northern high rates depend on the
density of harvested areas (especially rice paddies).
The global precipitation surplus (PS) over irrigated lands was found as 672 km3 and the spatial distribution of PSgrid is shown in Fig 3b. Although PS is a “water loss” for the water balance
of the root zone, it has an important role in the hydrological cycle and ecosystem functioning.
This rainfall water is not used by the crops, but it is an important source of recharge for
The comparison of national estimates (i.e. the sum of I and PS volumes from Eq (6) over
national areas) shows that 171 countries in the world require irrigation, and in 106 of them the
PS volume is higher than I. If part of this precipitation surplus could be stored and used during

the growing season, this would lead to a significant decrease in water withdrawals. For example, the irrigation required by China was estimated to the second highest in the world (130
km3/year) and even a higher precipitation surplus (193 km3/year); in theory, it could be possible to satisfy all the Chinese irrigation requirements by using annual precipitation on AEI.
Despite the apparent similarity between Fig 3a and 3b, we found a low annual correlation
between irrigation requirement and precipitation surplus: the Pearson index (R) between Igrid
and PSgrid is 0.38. We found an even lower correlation comparing the annual distribution of I
and PS (water depths over AEI) for which R = −0.16: the higher correlation between Igrid and
PSgrid is due to their common dependence on irrigated areas and cropping intensities. On a
monthly scale, where the variability of P and ET0 is more important, we found higher correlations between I and PS (e.g. RJuly = -0.29 and RDecember = -0.20).
In considering individual crops it is significant that, according to FAOSTAT, more than
48% of total agricultural production in tonnes in year 2000 included only four crops: sugar
cane, rice, wheat and maize. The irrigation required by these four was 58% of the global estimation. Rice’s requirement is the largest, nearly 30% of total. This is mainly because of the
huge extension of paddies, the high cropping intensity (e.g. in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and
Punjab in northern India, there are three consecutive growing seasons of rice per year) and the
high sensitivity of rice to soil moisture depletion. Paddies are artificially maintained at a high
moisture level, and field capacity is frequently reached even with weak precipitation, with a
consequent major loss of PS during rainfall events in the growing period. Table 2 summarizes
our findings on the crop-specific results, classifying them by the extent of irrigated areas from
MIRCA2000.
Fig 4 shows the temporal distribution of crop-specific volumes of irrigation requirements
for year 2000, calculated according to Eq (6) and cumulated at monthly scale. The largest volume is required from June to September, mainly because most of the summer crops are harvested in the northern hemisphere (e.g. 90% of maize I is required during these four months).
In contrast with other seasonal crops, wheat is massively cultivated during winter and spring,
and requires more irrigation from December to May. For example, more than 46% of wheat
AEI are in India and Pakistan, where this crop is mainly harvested from November to May
and most of the rainfall occurs in the summer. Winter wheat is also largely harvested in
Europe, U.S. and China, and is usually planted between October and December. In contrast,
in the northern part of India (e.g. Punjab) wheat is mainly harvested from June to November
as well as in southern Europe and in the US Northwest. The monthly volumes of irrigation
required by rice, wheat and cotton are well aligned with results from the GCWM model,
described by Siebert & Do¨ll , even if we found lower values of total irrigation requirement
in spring months.
4.2. Regional results on three intensive areas
To better explore the spatial variability of results and to verify the ability of the model to provide
estimates for various climate scenarios, the monthly water balance on three intensively harvested regions has been analyzed in more detail. These are: Central Valley (CV, California), Po
Valley (PV, Italy) and Punjab (PU, India), belonging respectively to sub-tropic winter rainfall,
temperate sub-continental and sub-tropic winter rainfall climatic zones. The three areas have
similar geographical extents (about 52000 km2, 47000 km2 and 50000 km2 respectively), but
heterogeneous portions of areas equipped for irrigation (42%, 32% and 72% respectively). Fig 5
shows the monthly variability of the main water-balance terms, i.e. the climate variables (P and
ET0), the area-weighted values of irrigation requirements, and precipitation surplus. The cumulative volumes of I and PS are also shown (on the right axes). In the lower part of each panel, the

bar graphs show the monthly distribution of AEI by actual crop harvested. CV is mainly cultivated with perennial crops (23% of total AEI), fodder grasses (18%), grapes (9%) and cotton
(12%); PV has maize (43%) and rice (10%) in the warm season and perennial crops over the
entire year (9%); PU is mainly harvested with wheat (45%), rice (23%) and cotton (19%).
Irrigation requirements of CV and PU are comparable (19.0 km3 and 20.6 km3 respectively)
but monthly values are very different, mainly because of the difference in precipitation and
evapotranspiration rates. In California, the maximum irrigation requirement is close to 190
mm for the month of July due to the combination of high ET0 and very low precipitation. In
this region, all the water surplus is concentrated in the winter months, with a maximum of 105
mm in February, while the high evapotranspiration rates of warm months (e.g. over 150 mm/
month in all the summer period) maximize the irrigation requirement. The Po Valley average
reference evapotranspiration is lower and precipitation is higher than in CV and PU, due to
the temperate climate. I reaches 50 mm only in July: a short period if compared with five
months in California and six in Punjab. Almost no irrigation is required in Po Valley from
October to April, due to the combined effect of high rainfall and low ET0. In this area, the

irrigation requirement is mainly concentrated in the summer period, but it only reaches 2.2
km3 (a small volume, compared with CV and PU). Annual water surplus over PV is 3.8 km3, a
huge volume if compared with the two other regions, but this surplus is mainly concentrated
in the October-November period. In fact, in year 2000 Po Valley was afflicted by an intense
flood event in November, so we can assume the high water surplus is strongly related to that
specific event.

4.3. Classification over water-stressed areas
Additional insights from the results can be gained by grouping the volumes of irrigation
requirement according to the classes of agricultural water risk described in the Water Risk
Framework, published by the Water Resources Institute . This framework includes a global
dataset of water risk indices , combining indicators of
physical risk, water quality and regulatory aspects for several human activities. We used the
“Agricultural Water Risks” indices to classify the irrigation requirements assessed by our
Fig 6 shows the distribution of irrigation requirement volumes by classes of agricultural
water risk: a high risk means that the requirement volume may be hard to satisfy. Irrigation
water could be unavailable (quantitative risk) or polluted (qualitative risk), and this may be
critical for crops.
Only 1.2% of global I volume falls within the low-risk class, mainly required in North
America and Oceania. Unfortunately, 44.5% of irrigation requirement is exposed to a
medium-high risk, and 28.4% to a high or extremely high risk.

agro-climatic zones: Central Valley (California, sub-tropic winter rainfall), Po Valley (Italy, temperate sub-continental) and Punjab (India, sub-tropic
summer rainfall). The variables on both the axes have been quantified considering the monthly harvested AEI, as shown in the lowest part of the plots.

Southern Asia is the most exposed area to agricultural water risk: most of the irrigation
required in this region (about 25% of global I) falls into the medium-high, high and extremely
high-risk classes. This is due to the fact that India and Pakistan are two of the most productive
countries, with two of the most water requiring agricultural systems.
About 87% of North American I is affected by low and medium risk, with western states
(e.g. California) being more exposed to quantity and quality limitations than are the central
and eastern regions. In North Africa, agricultural areas along big rivers are less exposed by risk
(e.g. the Nile delta) while the small fraction of croplands in the arid and semi-arid territory is
exposed to medium or high risk. The largest part of European irrigation requirement is
exposed to medium risk, but the nature of the risk is different depending on the climate region
(e.g. Po Valley is more exposed to quality-related risk, while Spain and southern Italy to quantity-related risk).
5. Discussion
5.1. Comparison with other global assessments
In comparing the results of this study with previous assessments, one must take into account
that all global assessments are affected by some uncertainty. The quality of input data, spatial

and temporal resolution, modelling assumptions such as the length and number of growing
seasons or the classification of some crops in macro-categories (e.g. “others annual”) play an
important role in the assessment of irrigation requirements. In this study, a part of the uncertainty is reduced using a model based on actual daily data of precipitation and temperature.
Table 3 shows a comparison of irrigation requirement results from the global models introduced in Table 1. The comparison points out the alignment of our estimation to the literature
and how much the improvement of the input detail affects the final result.
The estimate from this study is well aligned with most of the previous works, especially with
assessments based on the MIRCA2000 dataset. The differences between the latest models may
have several causes: the use of different climate datasets, the modelling approach for the crop
growth (e.g. Siebert & Do¨ll use average global values of crop coefficients, neglecting climate-related differences) and the initial soil moisture conditions (e.g. Chiarelli et al. performed a sensitivity analysis assuming three different scenarios to simulate the initial moisture
condition on the sowing date). The GCWM model from Siebert & Do¨ll provides three
results, obtained using different methods to estimate the reference evapotranspiration: 1180
km3/year using Penman-Monteith and two results using different alternatives of the Priestley-
Taylor method (1448 km3/year and 1145 km3/year). The estimate from the H07 model
(1320 km3/year) was reported by Siebert & Do¨ll , and refers to the 1986–1995 period.
Compared to later studies, the older models seem to overestimate the irrigation requirement. This is probably due to the fact that most of these models were not based on crop-specific data of irrigated areas and growing calendars, so the assessments were performed with a
larger number of assumptions, using average values to model the crop development. For example, Do¨ll et al. performed the assessment classifying rice paddies separately and aggregating all the other crops .
5.2. Comparison with national data
Model results, in terms of irrigation requirement volumes, have been cumulated at the
national scale and compared with data of agricultural withdrawal (W) for the year 2000, provided by AQUASTAT and by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) . The national irrigation withdrawals are the volumes of water taken from
surface water bodies or groundwater to be used in agriculture, in fields equipped for irrigation.
Withdrawals include the volumes required by crops and the water losses due to inefficiencies
in the distribution and irrigation systems.

The ratio between I and W can be reasonably associated with a national mean irrigation
efficiency (E), defined as the ratio between the amount of water withdrawn for agricultural
purposes and the theoretical volume required by crops. The irrigation requirements are equal
to withdrawals in the ideal condition of maximum efficiency (no water losses in the irrigation
system) and absence of water stress during the growing season. In the real systems withdrawals
are generally higher than requirements. The comparison between these two volumes is important to validate our estimations: the difference between I and W may depend on the technological level of the country, on the harvested crops (e.g. the irrigation efficiency of rice paddies is
generally very low) and on the availability of freshwater.
Fig 7 shows the logarithmic scatter plot of the 81 national withdrawals and requirement volumes. Nations are grouped by classes of efficiency, delimited by dotted, dashed and continuous lines: 45 nations lie between 0.1 and 0.5 and 18 nations between 0.5 and 1. More than 80%
of required volumes belong to nations within these ranges (54% belongs to nations with efficiency between 0.1 and 0.5). India, China and the USA are the countries with higher irrigation
requirement: 25.4%, 13.5% and 12.0% of global irrigation volumes, I, respectively. Spain is the
European country with the highest irrigation requirement (15.7 km3/year, near 1.6% of global
For 12 countries, the irrigation efficiencies were estimated to be lower than 0.1: in most of
these countries the irrigation water volumes are very small, due to the lack of irrigated lands.
Japan appears to have a surprisingly low efficiency (0.06), considering its economic and technological levels, but this may be a consequence of a massive presence of rice paddies (about
54% of total harvested areas, according to FAOSTAT) which have a very low irrigation efficiency: Do¨ll et al. assume an irrigation efficiency for rice lower than 0.1.
For 6 nations the mean efficiency is higher than 1 (irrigation requirement higher than agricultural withdrawals), e.g. United Kingdom (1.4), United Arab Emirates (1.5), Czech Republic
(4.5). Withdrawals lower than requirements in nations with high water-demand states like
United Arab Emirates may be due to deficit irrigation practices, in which a provision of lower
water volumes than actual requirements are due to lack of water availability . Results are
consistent with the efficiencies estimated by Siebert & Do¨ll , with similarities in some critical nations (e.g. they obtain E = 2.55 in Czech Rep. and E = 1.79 in UK). In some of these
nations, high efficiency values may be due to the low magnitude of irrigation requirement and
withdrawals.
5.3. U.S. irrigation requirements
A more detailed validation of the model has been done using data from the USA, for which the
Geological Survey (USGS) provides local information about irrigation withdrawals in year
2000 . Irrigated lands are more concentrated in the western US, especially in the Central
Valley of California, in Idaho and other northwestern states, but also in Nebraska and Arkansas (concentrated in the Mississippi region). According to this dataset, the USA withdrawal for
irrigation was 196.4 km3 in year 2000. Building a weighted linear regression between the
observed withdrawals and the irrigation requirements in each USA state (using AEI, i.e. Areas
Equipped for Irrigation, as weight), we estimate an angular coefficient (i.e. the expression of
the overall irrigation efficiency) of 0.58. This result is comparable with the value of 0.6 provided by Do¨ll et al. with the same procedure .
California is the US state with the largest extension of AEI and presents an irrigation efficiency of 0.64 (higher than the average value of United States). Fig 8 shows the comparison
between our crop-specific estimates of irrigation requirement (I) and the data of applied irrigation water (AW), which is the volume of withdrawn water that is actually delivered to the crop

fields. This information is available for seven crops, provided by the California Department of
Water Resources (CDWR) for year 2000 . Rice is the crop with the largest difference
between I and AW, and this is consistent with the low efficiency associated to paddies. The
same dataset also provides estimates of the crop-specific irrigation requirements in California.
We validated our model comparing our results with the estimates from the CDWR (ICDWR), as
shown in Fig 8.
The irrigation requirements obtained in this work are well aligned with the ICDWR: for
example, we find results for maize, rice and grapes corresponding to 98.0%, 94.5% and 93.7%

of ICDWR estimations respectively. Large differences between I and ICDWR volumes for cotton
and sugar beets are consistent with the differences of cropland extent between CDWR and
MIRCA2000. The ratio between AEI from MIRCA2000 and CDWR is 0.27 for sugar beets and
0.73 for cotton, and the ratios between I and ICDWR are 0.29 and 0.85 respectively.
Unfortunately, the other crop-specific information available in California are grouped into
categories (e.g. fruits or vegetables) that do not match the MIRCA2000 dataset, thus further
comparisons cannot be performed.
6. Conclusions
This work presents a model for the assessment of global irrigation requirement based on the
high-resolution dataset ERA5 from the Copernicus Climate Data Store. The model assesses the

minimum irrigation required to avoid water stress, working on a daily soil water balance and
modelling the crop development according to the FAO methodology, limiting uncertainties
related to climate-forcing data by using satellite information. The reference evapotranspiration
is calculated following the Hargreaves-Samani method, which requires only information about
surface temperature and solar radiation, and fits very well when compared to more complex
and data-intensive methods like Penman-Monteith.
The model was used to assess the irrigation requirements for 26 crops in the world, working
on crop-specific agricultural areas equipped for irrigation, while the focus on year 2000 is
motivated by agricultural data availability permitting comparison of results with previous
studies, many of which were focused on that year. Due to the difficulties in simulating crop
development on a global scale in many different climatic, technological and cultural scenarios,
the main uncertainty remains the correct modelling of the length of growing periods.
The global irrigation requirement for year 2000 was found to be about 962 km3, which is an
amount comparable both with results from models driven by long-term climate data and from
models working with monthly time series. The spatial distribution of irrigation requirements
(0.0833˚) points out their dependency on the extension of local areas equipped for irrigation,
the crop intensity and the kind of crop harvested, as well as the lack of precipitation during
growing periods. The model also estimates that an important amount of rainfall occurring
along the growing seasons is lost as surplus over irrigated lands (672 km3, about 68% of irrigation requirement), mainly motivated by the seasonal variability of precipitation.
The comparison between irrigation requirements and national data of agricultural water
withdrawals shows a good agreement between the two variables, with reasonable values of irrigation efficiencies. The model has been validated through a comparison between crop-specific
estimations of irrigation requirements and data provided by the California Department of
Water Resources, which highlights a very good fitting.
The classification of irrigation requirements by classes of agricultural water risk shows that
most of the requirement in South and East Asia is exposed to high and very high risk of not
being satisfied, due to possible unavailability of irrigation water in terms of quantity and quality. The global estimation described in this work is a first step of a wider project of irrigation
assessment, in which the temporal variability and the use of additional data from remote sensing are foreseen.
