Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, and use of therapeutic
peptides to target and kill cancer cells has received considerable attention in recent
years. Identification of anticancer peptides (ACPs) through wet-lab experimentation
is expensive and often time consuming; therefore, development of an efficient
computational method is essential to identify potential ACP candidates prior to in vitro
experimentation. In this study, we developed support vector machine- and random
forest-based machine-learning methods for the prediction of ACPs using the features
calculated from the amino acid sequence, including amino acid composition, dipeptide
composition, atomic composition, and physicochemical properties. We trained our
methods using the Tyagi-B dataset and determined the machine parameters by 10fold cross-validation. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of our methods on
two benchmarking datasets, with our results showing that the random forest-based
method outperformed the existing methods with an average accuracy and Matthews
correlation coefficient value of 88.7% and 0.78, respectively. To assist the scientific
community, we also developed a publicly accessible web server at www.thegleelab.

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is a heterogeneous group of several
complex diseases, rather than a single disease, which is
characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and the ability
to rapidly spread or invade other parts of the body. This
inherent complexity and heterogeneous nature of cancer
has proven to be a major hurdle for the development
of effective anticancer therapies . Conventional
methods for cancer treatment, including radiotherapy and
chemotherapy, are expensive and often exhibit deleterious
side effects on normal cells. Additionally, cancer cells are
capable of developing resistance to current anticancer
chemotherapeutic drugs . Therefore, it is necessary
to continually develop novel anticancer drugs to attenuate
cancer cell proliferation. Peptide-based therapy has
several advantages over the use of other small molecules
due to their high specificity, increased capability for
tumor penetration, and minimal toxicity under normal
physiological conditions .
Anticancer peptides (ACPs) are peptides capable of
use as therapeutic agents to treat various cancers. Recent
studies showed that ACPs are selective toward cancer
cells without affecting normal physiological functions,
making them a potentially valuable therapeutic strategy
 . ACPs contain between 5-30 amino acids and exhibit

cationic amphipathic structures capable of interacting
with the anionic lipid membrane of cancer cells, thereby
enabling selective targeting . In the previous decade,
multiple peptide-based therapies against various tumor
types have been evaluated and are currently undergoing
evaluation in various phases of preclinical and clinical
trials , confirming the importance of developing novel
ACPs for cancer treatment.
Experimental identification and development of
novel ACPs represent extremely expensive and often
time-consuming processes. Therefore, development of
sequence-based computational methods is necessary to
allow the rapid identification of potential ACP candidates
prior to their synthesis. To this end, computational
methods, including AntiCP, iACP, and that described
by Hajisharifi et al , have been developed for
ACP prediction . Existing methods separately
use properties, such as amino acid composition (AAC),
binary profile, dipeptide composition (DPC), and Chou’s
pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC), extracted
from the primary sequence as input features to a support
vector machine (SVM) for the development of a prediction
model. Surprisingly, all of these methods use the same
machine-learning (ML) method, with the two methods
[that of Hajisharifi et al and iACP] using the same
dataset for prediction-model development. These methods
produced encouraging results, and iACP and AntiCP
remain the only publically available programs for assisting
the scientific community .
Although, the existing methods have specific
advantages for ACP prediction, it remains necessary to
improve prediction accuracy. In this study, we developed
ML-based methods [SVM and random forest (RF); named
SVMACP and RFACP, respectively] to predict ACPs
(MLACP) using combinations of features calculated
from the peptide sequence, including AAC, DPC, atomic
composition (ATC), and physicochemical properties
(PCP). When tested upon benchmarking datasets, our
proposed methods outperformed the existing ones in
predicting ACPs. Moreover, we developed a web tool to
assist the scientific community working in the field of ACP
therapeutics and biomedical research.
Dataset construction
A detailed description of dataset construction is
given in the ‘materials and methods’ section. An overview
of our methodology is shown in Figure 1. Briefly, we
generated three different datasets, namely Tyagi-B dataset,
Hajisharifi-Chen (HC), and LEE dataset. The histogram
of peptide-length distribution of these datasets is shown
in Figure 2. Most of the ACPs contain <35 amino acid
residues and non-ACPs have a wider size distribution in
Tyagi-B dataset (Figure 2A), which was utilized in the
development of a prediction model. HC and LEE datasets
were treated as benchmarking datasets. Among these, HC
showed similar distribution between ACPs and non-ACPs
(Figure 2B), whereas, in LEE dataset, most of the ACPs
contained <25 amino acid residues and non-ACPs showed
a wider distribution (Figure 2C).
Compositional analysis
To perform compositional analysis of ACPs and
non-ACPs, AAC, DPC, PCC, and ATC frequencies were
calculated using the Tyagi-B and HC datasets. AAC
analysis revealed that certain residues, including A, F,
K, L, and W, were dominant in ACPs, whereas D, E, G,
N, and Q were dominant in non-ACPs (Welch’s t test; p
< 0.01). PCP analysis indicated that only two properties
(hydrophobicity and residue mass) were dominant in
ACPs, whereas the remaining nine properties were
dominant in non-ACPs. ATC analysis revealed that
hydrogen and carbon content dominated at a slightly
higher level in ACPs as compared with non-ACPs (Figure
3A). Moreover, DPC analyses revealed that 104 out of 400
dipeptides were differentially present in ACPs and non-
ACPs (p < 0.01). Our analyses also revealed that the 10
most abundant dipeptides in ACPs and non-ACPs were
KK, AK, KL, AL, KA, KW, LA, LK, FA, and LF and KG,
GL, GV, LD, GI, DL, LS, SG, LV, and TL, respectively
(Figure 3B).
Based on these findings, it was evident that the
most abundant dipeptides in ACPs consisted primarily
of pairs of positively charged-aromatic or –aliphatic
amino acids, positively charged-positively charged amino
acids, or aliphatic-aromatic amino acids, whereas the
most abundant dipeptides in the non-ACPs were pairs of
aliphatic–negatively charged amino acids and aliphatic–
hydroxyl-group-containing amino acids. As expected,
these results agreed with AAC analysis, which showed
that positively charged and aromatic amino acids were
abundant in ACPs, whereas negatively charged and
hydroxyl-group-containing amino acids were the most
abundant in non-ACPs.
Construction of SVMACP and RFACP
In this study, we considered two most commonly
used ML methods (i.e. RF and SVM) to predict ACPs.
One of the most important steps in ML method is feature
selection. Here, we considered both composition- and
property-based features (Figure 4). AAC, DPC, ATC, and
PCP contained 20, 400, 5, and 11 features, respectively.
First, we developed a prediction model based on an
individual composition and subsequently developed
hybrid models based on the combination of all possible
compositions. For each model, we optimized the ML
parameters (SVM: C and γ; RF: ntree, mtry, and nsplit)
by using 10-fold cross-validation on Tyagi-B dataset.
Oncotarget
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
During 10-fold cross-validation, the Tyagi-B dataset was
randomly divided into 10 parts (with ~10% ACPs and non-
ACPs resident in each part), from which nine parts were
used for training, and the 10th part was used for testing.
This process was repeated until all the parts were used
at least once as a test set, and the overall performance on
all 10 parts was evaluated. The optimal parameters which
gave the highest MCC was selected as the final one. It
should be noted that we performed ten independent 10fold cross-validations to verify the robustness of the ML
parameters.
The following subsections describe the development
of different models and the criteria used for final-model
selection.
AAC-based models
Previous studies showed that AAC-based ML
methods had been developed for the classification of
different classes of peptides . During compositional
analysis, we found significant differences between ACPs
and non-ACPs (Figure 3). Therefore, we utilized these
differences to classify peptides as ACPs or non-ACPs
using ML models. Table 1 shows that the SVM model
produced the best classification, with an accuracy of 0.858
and an MCC of 0.664, while the corresponding values for
the RF model were 0.868 and 0.689, respectively.
DPC-based models
DPC provides additional information regarding the
global and local arrangement of residues in a sequence
as compared with AAC. DPC-based ML methods have
been previously utilized to classify different classes of
peptides . Therefore, in this study, we developed
RF- and SVM-based models using DPCs. The SVM
model produced the best classification, with an accuracy
of 0.853 and an MCC of 0.653, whereas the corresponding
Figure 1: Flowchart showing steps involved in the development of prediction model (MLACP methodology).
Oncotarget
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
values for the RF-based model were 0.850 and 0.644,
respectively. The performance of the DPC-based model
was similar to that of the AAC-based model.
ATC-based models
We calculated a set of ATCs from the given peptides,
because these were previously shown to be useful for
the prediction of antihypertensive peptides .
Therefore, in this study, we developed RF- and SVMbased models using ATC. Our results showed that the
SVM-based model produced the best classification, with
an accuracy of 0.802 and an MCC of 0.519, whereas the
corresponding values for the RF-based model were 0.826
and 0.587, respectively. However, the performance of the
ATC-based model was slightly worse relative to that of the
AAC- and DPC-based models (Table 1).
PCP-based models
For each dataset, we calculated a set of PCPs for
each peptide, because these were previously shown to be
useful for the prediction of different classes of proteins
 . Therefore, in this study, we developed SVM- and

number of peptides. (A) Tyagi-B dataset. (B) HC dataset. (C) LEE dataset.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
RF-based models using PCPs. Results indicated that the
SVM-based model produced the best classification, with
an accuracy of 0.759 and an MCC of 0.420, whereas the
corresponding values for the RF-based model were 0.814
and 0.553, respectively. However, the performance of this
model was worse relative to that of each of the other three
models (Table 1).
The hybrid model
Although individual composition-based models
showed good or acceptable performance, to further
improve the collective performance, we combined these
features using all possible combinations to construct
hybrid models. This approach has been widely applied
in different peptide- and protein-composition-based
classification methods . Table 1 shows that a hybrid
model containing all of the composition- and propertybased features produced the best classification among the
different SVM-based hybrid models. Figure 5A shows the
profile of classification accuracy verses the variations of
parameters C and γ using all composition- and propertybased features. The best classification accuracy of 0.872
peaked at (ln(C), ln(γ)) = (0.778, 2.178) was selected as
the final model (SVMACP). Moreover, Table 1 shows that
an RF-based hybrid model containing all of the features
and a model containing only three features (excluding
DCP) produced the same results. Notably, adding DCP
features into the three combined features did not detract
from the predictive performance; therefore, we selected
the model containing all of the composition- and propertybased features as the final prediction model (RFACP).
Figure 5B shows the profile of classification accuracy
verses variations in the parameters ntree and mtry using
all composition- and property-based features. The best
classification accuracy of 0.872 peaked at (ntree, mtry) =
(450, 3) was selected as the final RF-based model.
Performance of our methods against AntiCP
using the HC dataset
We evaluated the performance of our methods
(SVMACP and RFACP) against that of the AntiCP
(model_1 and model_2) using the HC dataset, with the

results shown in Table 2 . The methods in the Table 2
are ranked according to the accuracy, which reflects the
prediction capability of the method. For comparison,
we also included iACP and the methods presented by
Hajisharifi et al results, wherein the authors used
the same dataset for their prediction model development
 . Among the methods evaluated using the HC dataset,
RFACP ranked at the top, with MCC, accuracy, sensitivity,
and specificity values of 0.885, 0.946, 0.889, and 0.981,
respectively. Additionally, RFACP performance was
significantly better than that of AntiCP models, which
exhibited ~8% and ~54% decreases in model_2 and
model_1 accuracy, respectively, and SVMACP, which
exhibited an ~6% decrease in accuracy. Furthermore,
comparison of RFACP relative to iACP and that of
Hajisharifi et al showed that RFACP results
were slightly better than those of the method presented
by Hajisharifi et al , which exhibited a decrease
in accuracy of ~2%, and similar to iACP results. Table
2 shows that SVMACP ranked second among all of
the methods, exceeding the performance of the AntiCP
models, which exhibited ~1% and ~48% decreases in
Figure 4: Overview of feature extraction. We used both composition-based and property-based information from a given peptide
sequence and used as input feature to ML method. AAC, DPC, ATC, and PCP contained 20, 400, 5, and 11 features, respectively.

accuracy for model_2 and model_1, respectively. When
comparing both AntiCP models, it was observed that
model_1 predicted almost all of the given peptides as
potential ACPs, suggesting that model_2 performance is
better in ACP prediction.
Performance of our methods and other existing
methods using the LEE dataset
We evaluated the performance of our methods
(SVMACP and RFACP), and the existing methods
including iACP, and AntiCP (model_1 and model_2)
on the LEE dataset. Notably, our LEE dataset contained
844 peptides, which was ~3-fold larger than previously
used benchmark datasets. Table 3 shows that RFACP
was ranked at the top, with MCC, accuracy, sensitivity,
and specificity values of 0.674, 0.827, 0.706, and 0.948,
respectively. Additionally, the performance of RFACP was
slightly better than that of SVMACP, which showed a ~1%
decrease in accuracy, and significantly better than AntiCP
models, which exhibited ~7.5% and ~30% decreases in
accuracy for model_2 and model_1, respectively, and
iACP, which exhibited ~12% decreases in accuracy.
SVMACP ranked second in performance, which was
significantly better than AntiCP models, which exhibited
~6% and 28.7% decreases in accuracy for model_2
and model_1, respectively, and iACP, which exhibited
11% decreases in accuracy. AntiCP model_2 and iACP
occupied the third and fourth positions, respectively, with
AntiCP model_1 exhibiting the worst performance. This
evaluation clearly showed that RFACP and SVMACP
exceeded the performance of the existing methods.
Interestingly, although SVMACP and RFACP produced
the same results (MCC: 0.697 and 0.872, respectively)
on the training dataset, RFACP performance was slightly
better on the benchmarking datasets (~6% better on the HC
dataset and ~1% better on the LEE dataset) relative to that
of SVMACP. This result showed that the RF-based method
was more effective than the SVM for ACP prediction. A
previous study reported successful application of RF for
many biomedical classification problems .
Moreover, a detailed comparison of our methods and the
existing methods in terms of methodology is provided in
Table 4 , showing that our methodology exceeded current
methods while using a slightly larger training dataset,
different ML methods, additional features, and larger
benchmarking datasets.

this end, an online prediction server called MLACP was
developed to allow ACP prediction using the methods
presented here. The prediction server is freely accessible
at the following link: www.thegleelab.org/MLACP.html.
Users can paste or upload query peptide sequences in the
FASTA format, and after submitting peptide sequences,
retrieve results in a separate interface. To enable the
reproducibility of our findings, all datasets used in this
study can be downloaded from the MLACP web server.
DISCUSSION
Anticancer peptides exhibit a broad spectrum of
activity, including the ability to kill cancer cells, destroy
primary tumors, prevent metastasis, and perform these
actions at adequate concentrations without damaging
normal cells or vital organs . To identify highly
efficient ACPs, an experimentalist should screen a peptide
from the existing peptide libraries or scan the entire

protein in overlapping-window patterns associated with
areas of peptide chains, and test each segment for its
potential anticancer activity, which seems laborious and
time-consuming. Therefore, the development of sequencebased computational methods capable of determining
ACP candidates will be helpful to researchers, who are
keen to rapidly screen ACPs prior to its synthesis, thereby
accelerating ACP-based research. Here, we developed two
MLACP methods, RFACP and SVMACP.
AAC, DPC, ATC, and PCP analyses revealed that
ACPs most often consist of positively charged, aromatic,
and hydrophobic residues. Previous studies showed
that peptide hydrophobicity plays an important role in
membrane permeabilization and/or anticancer activity [9,

39]. Furthermore, we observed a significant difference
in residue preference between ACPs and non-ACPs,
which prompted us to use these as input features to ML
methods to encourage improved classification. The major
advantage of ML methods is their capability to consider
multiple features simultaneously, often capturing hidden
relationships .
In this study, we employed two different ML
algorithms, SVM and RF, for ACP prediction, whereas
existing methods use only SVM . This is the first
application of an RF-based method in ACP prediction,
with systematic approaches employed to select between
SVMACP- and RFACP-based prediction models.
Notably, MLACP represents the only method utilizing
a combination of all composition- and property-based
features as inputs; however, other existing methods
[AntiCP, iACP, and that of Hajishari et al ] utilize
only one of the following properties, AAC, DPC, binary
profile, or PseAAC, separately as an input feature to
SVM in order to develop their prediction models .
Although, AAC and DPC features were used in earlier
studies, this is the first study describing the use of PCP
and ATC features for ACP prediction. To show the effect
of including PCP and ATC in MLACP (i.e. RFACP and
SVMACP), we evaluated a prediction model (which
contains only AAC and DCP as input features) on LEE
datasets. Supplementary Information 1 shows that
improvement of both ML-based methods is found by
adding PCP and ATC into MLACP.
We used two benchmarking datasets (HC and LEE)
to evaluate the performance of our methods along with
the existing methods. Using the HC dataset, RFACP and
SVMACP, respectively, ranked as the first and second most
effective predictors, with significantly better performances
than the existing AntiCP methods (model_2 and model_1).
Interestingly, RFACP accuracy was better than that of the
method described by Hajisharifi et al using the
same training set. Recently, Chen et al evaluated
their method along with the AntiCP method using a
smaller benchmarking dataset (300 peptides). Indeed, this
was the first instance where ACP-prediction methods were
evaluated using standard benchmarking dataset. However,
the LEE dataset constructed in this study was almost 3-fold
larger than previously reported benchmarking datasets.
Such a large-sized benchmarking dataset is sufficient to
evaluate the performance of various methods, with our
benchmarking results showing that RFACP significantly
outperformed existing methods (AntiCP and iACP) both
in terms of accuracy and MCC. SVMACP ranked as the
second most effective ACP predictor, with performance
still significantly better than those of the other existing
methods. The improved performance of our methods
is primarily due to the larger size of training dataset,
rigorous optimization procedures to select ML parameters,
inclusion of new features, the combination of various
properties, and the choice of ML method. However, a
limitation of this method is that the prediction might not
be accurate for longer peptides (length > 50 amino acids)
due to their exclusion from the training dataset. Although,
our current method is focused on the sequence-based
prediction, further studies focused on structure-based
membrane-peptide interaction is needed
Consensus algorithms combine output from
different predictors popular tools used in various fields
of bioinformatics; however, these methods remain in the
early stages of development for use in ACP prediction. To
generate higher confidence in ACP prediction, we have
presented the option of considering consensus results from
RFACP and SVMACP methods. Similar approaches were
recently implemented via generation of consensus results
to predict ACPs from Achatina fulica mucus for further
experimentation .
The comparatively low cost and minimal time
required for the in silico identification of ACPs when
compared to the tedious and expensive experimental
procedures make these computational tools more
attractive among the scientific community. In this study,
we developed a novel method to predict ACPs from the
sequence information and our results showed that the
prediction accuracy is significantly higher than the existing
methods. Our developed MLACP tool is freely available
for research use as a web server. We hope that our method
will be useful to both experimentalists and computational
biologists.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
As demonstrated by a series of recent publications
 in compliance with Chou's 5-step rule ,
to establish a really useful sequence-based statistical
predictor for a biological system, we should follow the
following five guidelines: (a) construct or select a valid
dataset to train and test the predictor; (b) formulate
the biological sequence samples with an effective
mathematical expression that can truly reflect their
intrinsic correlation with the target to be predicted; (c)
introduce or develop a powerful algorithm (or engine)
to operate the prediction; (d) properly perform crossvalidation tests to objectively evaluate the anticipated
accuracy of the predictor; (e) establish a user-friendly
web-server for the predictor that is accessible to the
public. Below, we are to describe how to deal with these
steps one-by- one.
Dataset collection
Training dataset
We utilized the Balanced 1 (B1) and Balanced 2
(B2) datasets described previously to generate a new
dataset called the Tyagi-B dataset. In total, we obtained
450 ACPs (225 each from B1 and B2) and 450 non-ACPs
Oncotarget
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
(225 each from B1 and B2) by combining both the B1
and B2 datasets. Additionally, we applied the following
screening procedures on B1 and B2 datasets: 1) peptides
that contained non-natural amino acid residues, 2) peptides
with length >50 amino acid residues, and 3) redundant
and/or similar peptides defined by the CD-HIT program
( by applying a 90%
sequence-identity cut-off. It should be noted that similar
peptides were removed only from the training dataset and
not from the benchmarking dataset. To avoid overfitting
in the prediction model, we excluded redundant or similar
peptides. Since very few peptides have length greater than
50 amino acid residues, we also excluded these peptides to
avoid outlier in the prediction model. After the screening
procedure, we obtained 187 ACPs and 398 non-ACPs
(Tyagi-B dataset) for use in developing the prediction
Benchmarking datasets
To compare our methods with existing methods,
we generated two datasets: 1) one based on the dataset
reported from previous studies and 2) another based on
our own search against the existing databases. We named
the first and second datasets as Hajisharifi-Chen (HC)
and LEE datasets, respectively. It should be noted that
Hajisharifi et al and Chen et al developed
their prediction models using the same dataset, which
contained 138 ACPs and 206 non-ACPs. After applying
the screening procedure described in the previous section,
we obtained 126 ACPs and 205 non-ACPs (HC dataset).
Construction of the LEE dataset proceeded as
follows. We applied the screening procedure described
in the previous section to an independent dataset (ACPs
and non-ACPs: 150 peptides each) reported by Chen
et al , obtaining 140 ACPs and 94 non-ACPs.
Furthermore, we extracted 229 and 53 experimentally
validated ACPs from CancerPPDB ( 
raghava/cancerppd/) and APD3 ( 
AP/database/antiC.php), respectively . Because few
experimentally determined non-ACPs are present in the
LEE dataset, we obtained 98 non-ACPs from the Tyagi
independent datasets and generated 234 random peptides
Swiss-Prot
( with these representing a set of
non-ACPs for the LEE dataset. This strategy for creating
a negative-control dataset was implemented in previous
studies . In total, we generated 844 peptides (422
ACPs and 422 non-ACPs; LEE dataset). We note here that
the peptides in the LEE dataset are unique (i.e., they are
present neither in our training dataset nor the prediction
models used by previous methods).
Feature generation
The aim of this experiment was to train either
an SVM or RF model to accurately map input features
extracted from a peptide primary sequence to predict
its class (i.e., ACP or non-ACP), which is considered a
classification problem. The most crucial part of this task
is extraction of a set of relevant features. All possible
features used in this study are shown in Figure 4, and the
definition of each composition-based feature is provided
AAC is defined as the fraction of each amino
acid present in a given peptide sequence. AAC can be
calculated by using the following equation:
Frequency of amino acid
Length of the peptide
where i can be any natural amino acid. The AAC has a
fixed length of 20 features.
Atomic composition (ATC)
Recently, Kumar et al reported the number
and types of atoms present in naturally occurring amino
acids. In this study, we utilized those data and calculated
the frequency of each atom (C, H, N, O, and S) present in
the given peptide sequence. The ATC has a fixed length of
five features.
DPC represents the total number of dipeptides
normalized by all the possible combinations of dipeptides
present in the given peptide sequence. DPC has a fixed
length of 400 (20 × 20) features which can be calculated
using the following equation:
Total number of Di
Total number of all possible di
peptides ,  (2)
where DPC(j) is one of 400 possible dipeptides.
PCP represents the physicochemical class of
residues present in a given peptide sequence. We
calculated the percentage composition of polar (D, E, R,
K, Q, N), hydrophobic (C, V, L, I, M, F, W), charged (D,
E, K, H, R), aliphatic (I, L, V), aromatic (F, H, W, Y),
positively charged (H, K, R), negatively charged (D, E),
tiny (A, C, D, G, S, T), small (E, H, I, L, K, M, N, P, Q,
V), and/or large (F, R, W, Y) amino acid residues, as well
as peptide mass , and used these eleven
properties as an input feature.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
where all four properties have been considered in ACP

prediction. Notably, PCC and ATC have never been
considered prior to this, whereas DPC and AAC have been
utilized in existing ML-based methods for ACP prediction
Methodology
We employed RF- and SVM-based ML methods to
develop a prediction model using the Tyagi-B dataset. The
description of the two ML methods is provided below.
RF is an ensemble technique utilizing hundreds
or thousands of independent decision trees to perform
classification and regression and that has
been used for numerous biological applications. A
detailed description of the RF algorithm has been reported
elsewhere . The three most influential parameters
of this algorithm, including the number of trees (ntree),
number of variables randomly chosen at each node split
(mtry), and minimum number of samples required to
split an internal node (nsplit), require optimization. We
optimized these parameters using a grid search within the
following ranges: ntree from 10 to 500, with a step size of
10; m from 1 to 7, with a step size of 1; and nsplit from 2
to 10, with a step size of 1.
The SVM is a well-known supervised-ML technique
used for developing both classification and regression
models, and a detailed description of an SVM has been
reported elsewhere . In this study, we
experimented with several common kernels, including
a linear, a Gaussian radial-basis function (RBF), and
a polynomial. Among these, RBF worked best for our
purposes. A RBF-SVM requires optimization of two
critical parameters: γ, which controls how peaked
Gaussians are centered on the support vectors; and C,
which controls the trade-off between training error and
margin size . These two parameters were
optimized using a grid search within the following ranges:
C from 2−15 to 210 and γ from 2−10 to 210 in log2 scale.
In this study, we used SVM and RF as implemented
in the scikit-learn package .
Cross-validation
In statistical prediction, the following three crossvalidation methods are often used to examine a predictor
for its effectiveness in practical application: independent
dataset test, subsampling test, and jackknife test. However,
of the three test methods, the jackknife test is deemed the
least arbitrary that can always yield a unique result for a
given dataset as elaborated in and demonstrated by
Eqs.28-30 in . Accordingly, the jackknife test has been
widely recognized and increasingly used by investigators
to examine the quality of various predictors .
However, to reduce the computational time, we adopted
the 10-fold cross-validation in this study was done by
many investigators .
Evaluation metrics
To measure prediction quality, we used the
following four metrics: sensitivity, specificity, accuracy,
and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Since,
the conventional formulae of these metrics lacking
intuitiveness and not easy-to-understand for most
biologist, particularly MCC. Chen et al derived
a new set of equations for the above-mentioned metrics
based on Chou’s symbols used in studying protein signal
peptide cleavage site . The new formulae for these
metrics are given in equation (3).
Sensitivity
Specificity
where N+ represents the total number of ACPs investigated,
+ represents the number of ACPs incorrectly predicted as
non-ACPs, N − represents the total number of non-ACPs
investigated and N+
− represents the number of non-ACPs
incorrectly predicted as ACPs. The formulae given in eq
(3) is more intuitive and easy-to-understand, particularly
for the meaning of MCC, as concurred by a series of
studies published recently . The set
of metrics is valid only for the single-label systems. For
the multi-label systems, whose existence has become more
frequent in system biology and system medicine , a completely different set of metrics is needed as
defined in .
Development of a prediction server
An online prediction server was also developed
using hypertext markup language and Java script,
with a Python script executing in the backend upon
submission of peptide sequences in the FASTA
format. Users can submit single or multiple sequences

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
containing only standard amino acid residues in FASTA
format, after which the MLACP web server outputs the
results  of  RFACP and SVMACP for a given peptide
Statistical analysis
The differences in AAC, ATC, PCP, and DPC
between ACPs and non-ACPs were analyzed using
Welch’s t test. The data are presented as mean ± standard
error (SE). Statistical differences were considered
significant at p < 0.01, indicates that the difference is
statistically meaningful. All statistical analysis was
performed using our own script.
