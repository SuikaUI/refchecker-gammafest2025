Conventional diﬀusion ⟨∆R2(t)⟩= 2Dt gives way to subdiﬀusion ⟨∆R2(t)⟩∼tµ, 0 < µ < 1 when
the waiting time distribution ϕ(τ) is non-integrable. We have studied a model system, colloidal
particles functionalized with DNA “sticky ends” diﬀusing on a complementary coated surface. We
observe a crossover from subdiﬀusive to conventional behavior for ⟨∆R2(t)⟩and ϕ(τ) as temperature is increased near the particle-surface melting temperature consistent with a simple Gaussian
distribution of sticky ends. Our results suggest that any system with randomness in its binding
energy should exhibit subdiﬀusive behavior as it unbinds. This will strongly eﬀect the kinetics of
self-assembly.

Diﬀusive processes are of wide interest in understanding various phenomena from the self-assembly materials
 to the kinetics of reaction , the migration of large
molecules , transport in complex networks and protein dynamics . Typically diﬀusive behavior is characterized by the mean squared displacement (MSD) increasing linearly with time. However, for many physical
systems, an anomalous time dependence is found . That is, ⟨∆R2(t)⟩∼tµ, with µ ̸= 1. As has been analyzed in the continuous random walk model (CTRW) , subdiﬀusion (µ < 1) may arise when there is a broad
distribution of local waiting times, ϕ(τ) ∼τ −(1+µ); while
superdiﬀusion (µ > 1) corresponds to long-range correlations in velocities or “Levy ﬂights”. Although mechanisms
for anomalous diﬀusion have been studied theoretically
and numerically, there have been few experimental tests of
subdiﬀusion where displacements, and waiting times are
experimentally measured and compared with a theoretical model. In this letter we present an investigation of a
model system: Licata and Tkachenko analyzed such systems and found complex behavior including self-diﬀusion.
Moreover, this colloidal system with its speciﬁc reversible
bonds is often used for self-assembly where the kinetics, often slow relaxational kinetics, are important to understand
both the formation process and the ﬁnal structures .
A basic question for complex self-assembly is how particles diﬀuse on each other’s surface once they are bound
and how long should the system be allowed to equilibrate.
A schematic of the experimental geometry is shown in
The DNA used contains 61-nucleotides(ordered
from IDT, Coralville, IA), hybridized from its 5′ end with
complementary DNA strands including 49 nucleotides,
leaving one base as a hinge and 11 unpaired bases for use
as “sticky ends”. The particles used in the study are 1.05
µm streptavidin coated beads (density ∼2.2 × 103kg/m3)
purchased from Invitrogen and the substrate is a silicon
wafer coated with 5 nm Cr and 20 nm Au.
strands (labeled as C in Fig.1) are connected at the 5′
end to a TEG spacer terminated by a biotin group which
attaches to the streptavidin on the particles.The complementary DNA strands (C′-sequence) have a TEG spacer

consisting of 1.05µm diameter streptavidine-coated beads and

by short(h ∼15nm) complementary DNA strands (C/C’). A
sterically stabilizing polymer brush prevents non-speciﬁc binding between particles and surface.
attached to a thiol group which binds to the Au surface.
The coverage of the surfaces was measured by radioactive
labeling (32P) tracer DNA’s. This determination shows
that the average spacing between strands on the particle
and gold surfaces are about 12 nm and 18 nm respectively. The entire preparation process was performed in
the buﬀer(pH 7.5) with a total concentration of 10 mM
phosphate, 50mM NaCl and 0.5% w/w Pluronic surfactant (F108, the Polymer brush shown in the FIG.1). The
particles are heavy so that their motion is conﬁned in the
region near the bottom plane. Therefore, the system can
be treated as 2D in our experiments.
The aggregation of complementary DNA functionalized colloids is well described in Refs and characterized by the fraction of singlet, unpaired particles
as a function of temperature.
Here we adapt a similar convention and plot the melting curve, FIG.2(a), for

particle-substrate binding as the fraction of moving particles. “Moving” is deﬁned as a displacement larger than
50nm (1 pixel) between frames (frame rate=1Hz). The
free energy of a single tethered DNA bond is ∆Ftether =
∆H0 −T ∆S0 −T ∆Sp, with ∆H0 = −322.4 kJ/mol K,
∆S0 = −935.6J/mol K for the sequence we used and
∆Sp is the entropy loss due to the restriction of its motion when joining the surface between beads . The
binding free energy of the bead is therefore
∆Fbead = −RT ln[(1 + ke−∆Ftether/RT )Nb −1].
where, Nb is the maximum number of bridges which can
form between surfaces and k indicates the number of bonds
that opposing sticky ends can reach. A simple geometrical
estimate gives Nb ≃150 and k ≃13 for our conﬁguration.
The solid line in FIG.2(a) is a model ﬁt (the
expression given in Ref. ) using ∆Sp = −14.76R.
Displacement vs time measurements were taken by
tracking individual particles with a microscope (Qimage
Retiga 1300 camera on a Leica microscope 100x, 50 nm
pixel size) over the temperature range 43 −47oC. Care
was taken to avoid any slow drift of the camera during
our observation. The sample is restrictedly sealed from
the atmosphere so that there is no external ﬂow and evaporation of the solution.

44.3oC,44.5oC and 44.7oC are shown in FIG.2(c).
each temperature 10 diﬀerent particles trajectories were
measured from 10sec to 10hrs. For all the temperatures,
the experiments were repeated for 10 separate samples.
At temperatures above the melting temperature of 45
oC, FIG.2(a), conventional diﬀusion was observed with
D47oC = ⟨∆r2(t)/4t⟩≈(0.38 ± 0.02)µm2/s. This value
is about 56% of the free diﬀusion (Df) value due to hydrodynamic proximity of the surface.
At 44.7oC, the
diﬀusion constant is greatly reduced, D44.7oC ≈1.4 ×
10−3µm2/s ∼D47oC/270 but diﬀusion is still conventional, ⟨∆R(t)2⟩∝t. At this temperature, the particle
is bound by DNA hybridization to the surface for a certain waiting time τ, escapes from the surface and diﬀuses
freely for an average time, τfree ∼0.4s, an average stepsize, l ∼pD47oCτfree ∼0.8µm and then rebinds to the
surface. The characteristic distance l ∼hg = kBT/mg is
the gravitational height. Therefore, in our system diﬀusion is governed by a well deﬁned stepsize h and a temperature dependent distribution of waiting times, τ.
⟨τ⟩exists, D ≃h2
g/⟨τ⟩. On further lowering the temperature the DNA binding becomes more important and
as the waiting time increases the ensemble averaged MSD
becomes subdiﬀusive. A power law ﬁt to the experimental results gives µ = 0.35 ± 0.02, 0.53 ± 0.02, 0.78 ± 0.03
as T = 44.1oC, 44.3oC, 44.5oC, FIG.2(b). In this regime,
mobility decreases precipitously as temperature is lowered
and the dynamics is remarkably slowed down. The fact
that the residence time τ in the “traps” becomes very
long compared to ⟨τfree⟩allows us to treat our system
with a standard CTRW model in this temperature range.
For T < 44.1oC, the probability for particles to desorb
from the surface is too small to distinguish any signiﬁcant
Intrinsically, subdiﬀusive behavior is related to the waiting time, τ, before each step. In these experiments we have
measured the waiting time along with the displacement for
all particle trajectories. Again we use a simple protocol
that a particle is not moving if its displacement is less than
50nm (1 pixel). Here, we recorded τ of each step during
the diﬀusion process for every single particle, which statistically gives the likelihood of a particle sitting in a position
for time τ before performing next jump. The results can
be further converted into probability density distribution
of waiting time, ϕ(τ), which is shown in FIG.3 for the four
temperatures studied. The log-log plots show good ﬁts to
power laws ϕ(τ) ∼τ −(1+µ′) with µ′ = 0.32, 0.55, 0.73, 1.00
respectively.
Generally, if the number of bonds (Nb) formed between

a particle and surface is constant for a ﬁxed geometry, the
characteristic time for this particle to stick on the surface is given by ¯τ(Nb, T ) = 1
ω exp (−∆Fbead(Nb, T )/kBT).
Here the escape attempt frequency ω ∼
Rh ln(R/h) ∼
20Hz, which is the inverse of time to diﬀuse a DNA bond
length (h ∼15nm) .
However, in our experiment,
where the particle explores the DNA covered substrate,
the number of bonds Nb varies for each particle-surface
conﬁguration due to shape and coverage heterogeneities.
Thus, instead of treating Nb as constant, it is more reasonable to introduce a statistical distribution ρ(Nb) for the
probability of Nb bonds connecting particle to surface. For
each Nb, there is a characteristic time ¯τ(Nb, T ) as above
and the unbinding is a Poisson process with the probability
of survival at time τ: Ps(τ) ≈e−τ/¯τ(Nb,T ). For a normalized distribution of bond numbers ρ(Nb), this probability
becomes P(τ, T ) = P
Nb̸=0 ρ(Nb)e−τ/¯τ(Nb,T ) and the distribution of waiting times, τ,
ϕ(τ, T ) = −dP(τ, T )
¯τ(Nb, T ) exp(−
¯τ(Nb, T )).
ϕ(τ)∆τ gives the escape probability during the interval
τ →τ + ∆τ. Assuming that the heterogeneities in particle and surface coverage are uncorrelated, we take ρ(Nb)
as a Gaussian distribution ρ(Nb) =
2πσ2 exp(−(Nb−¯
with the mean value ¯N and variance σ. Here, the mean
number of the contacts is determined by our radioactive
trace measurement:
¯N ≃150. Therefore, the distribution has only one unknown, the variance σ, which can be
adjusted to the data.
In FIG.4 (a) we show the calculated and measured ϕ(τ) superposed where a least square
ﬁt was used to obtain σ = 29.8 ± 0.04 . Why does
this work so well given that our ϕ(τ) (Eq.(2)) is not an
obvious power law? In FIG.4(b), we plot ϕ(τ) for the temperature range of interest on log-log scales. It is clear that

In random walk theory, subdiﬀusion occurs when the average waiting time diverges, ⟨τaver⟩∼
τ ·τ−(1+µ)dτ →
∞(µ < 1). Finite ⟨τaver⟩gives linear diﬀusion. Nevertheless, our statistical model indicates that (from Eq.(2)):
ρ(Nb)[(1 + ke−∆Fbead/kBT )Nb −1]
so that ⟨τaver⟩remains ﬁnite.
If we wait long enough,
the particles must eventually exhibit conventional diﬀusion.
If ⟨τaver⟩is much longer than the total observation time (τtotal ∼10hrs), the particle will not explore the end of the power law tail of ϕ(τ, T ).
the subdiﬀusive behavior in this experiment happens only
for comparatively short observation time during which
the particles are not in equilibrium.
It is interesting
to ask how many ⟨τaver⟩one has to wait before getting
conventional “equilibrium” diﬀusion rather than subdiffusion.
Since our experimental ⟨τaver⟩depends on T ,
we can observe this crossover simply by increasing the
temperature.
For T = 44.1oC, 44.3oC, 44.5oC, τaver =
1.32 × 106s, 3.10 × 105s, 8.25 × 104s respectively, all of
which are longer than τtotal and exhibit subdiﬀusion. But
for T = 44.7o, τaver = 2.5 × 104s < ttotal ∼3 × 104s and
we observe conventional diﬀusion.
In summary, we have observed subdiﬀusion and a
crossover to conventional diﬀusion in a model system of
sticky particles made from DNA-functionalized colloids
and a complementary DNA coated surface. We show theoretically that the subdiﬀusion results from a distribution
of local waiting times related to a Gaussian distribution
of binding energies and Poisson statistics.
This is useful directly for studying the kinetics of DNA-based selfassembly and particularly its temperature dependence.
However, the fact that almost all “sticky” systems have
some Gaussian randomness in their binding energies suggests that subdiﬀusion should be ubiquitous over a temperature range near the dissociation point. We ﬁnd that
the crossover to conventional diﬀusion occurs as soon as
the measurement time is longer than the average escape
