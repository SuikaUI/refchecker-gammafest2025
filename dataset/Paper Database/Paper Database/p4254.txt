The stage of disease and general ﬁtness of patients usually
inﬂuences the treatments they receive. Because of this, tests
of treatments and treatment comparisons need to ensure
that treatment comparison groups are made up of patients
who are as similar as possible. Without this assurance, any
differences in the progress of patients receiving different
treatments cannot conﬁdently be ascribed to differential
effects of treatments: they may simply reﬂect differences in
the characteristics of patients receiving the different
treatments. This is the rationale underlying random
allocation (randomization) to treatment groups in randomized trials—to ensure that whether treatment is given or
withheld is unrelated to factors inﬂuencing the prognoses of

presents challenges that are judged likely to be very
difﬁcult to overcome. One such example relates to the need
to assess the effects of bone marrow transplantation in the
Randomized comparisons of treatment with and without
bone marrow transplantation in this form of leukaemia have
been judged unlikely to be achieved successfully, yet it is
clearly important to obtain reliable, unbiased estimates of
the effects of transplantation—wanted and unwanted—
because the disadvantages may outweigh any advantages of
this invasive treatment.
In 1991, Richard Gray and Keith Wheatley reported an
ingenious method for obtaining unbiased estimates of the
effects of bone marrow transplantation without conducting
a traditional randomized trial.1 They pointed out that
unbiased comparisons could be made between child patients
who had a genetically compatible sibling, and so in principle
could receive a matched sibling bone marrow transplant,
with other child patients who had no genetically compatible
sibling, and so were incapable of receiving a matched sibling
bone marrow transplant. Because having or not having a
genetically compatible sibling is a matter of chance—it is
determined by random assortment of genes at the time of
gamete formation and conception—this situation produces
what is effectively a randomized comparison.
Whether a child with leukaemia belongs to the group
with genetically compatible siblings or the group without
such siblings will not be related to potential confounding
factors such as disease stage and general ﬁtness at the
time of diagnosis. In a form of ‘intention-to-treat
analysis’, Gray and Wheatley noted that an unbiased
comparison meant comparing all the patients with a
genetically
compatible
without such a sibling, regardless of whether or not
every patient with a potential donor actually received a
transplant (Figure 1).1
Gray and Wheatley appear to have been the ﬁrst authors
to refer to this particular way of capitalizing on chance
events in nature to create unbiased comparison groups to
assess the effects of a treatment. They called it ‘Mendelian
randomization’. Several further studies have now been
carried out using their design,2–4 including studies to assess
the effects of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.5–7 Some of these studies have conﬁrmed that like is
being compared with like in comparison groups deﬁned in
this way.3–6 They have also shown that there are differences
in prognostic factors between groups deﬁned by the
treatment they received; differences that would confound
a conventional observational analysis comparing different
treatments.4–6
The basic design outlined in Figure 1 might be improved
by taking into account the number of siblings each patient
has.8 Patients with more siblings have a greater chance of
having a genetically compatible donor, and therefore groups
deﬁned by having a compatible donor will differ according
to average number of siblings and thus will differ by factors
that may be related to prognosis. Indeed, a later study
found that the number of siblings could itself be related to
survival.9 The study by Gray and Wheatley (Gray, personal
communication) and another more recent study4 applied an
analysis restricted to patients with at least one sibling, but
exact stratiﬁcation or matching on number of siblings might
be a more robust approach.

MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION IN OTHER
Mendelian randomization as a term has also recently been
used to describe methods for obtaining unbiased estimates
of causal associations in observational studies in aetiological
epidemiology. In part, these developments reﬂect a
response to well-publicized cases of conventional observational epidemiology having produced misleading information about supposed causal or protective factors, for
example, for b carotene and cancer, vitamins C and E and
coronary heart disease, and hormone replacement therapy
and cardiovascular disease. Observational epidemiological
studies suggested that these factors had important protective
effects, but randomized controlled trials failed to conﬁrm
this. The probable reason for these discrepancies between
analyses of observational data and randomized trials is that
there is considerable confounding between, for example,
dietary vitamin C or E intake or taking b carotene
supplements and various behavioural and socio-economic
factors related to increased risks of disease.
Mendelian randomization—the random assortment of
genes from parents to offspring which occurs during gamete
formation and conception—provides a method of assessing
whether certain environmental exposures are causally
related to a disease. The association between risk of a
disease and a genetic variant that inﬂuences the exposure or
mimics the biological link between a proposed exposure and
disease is not generally susceptible to the ‘reverse causation’
confounding
interpretations
conventional observational studies.
THE CONTRIBUTION OF MARTIJN KATAN
A Dutch researcher, Martijn Katan, was an early exponent
of what has since become termed Mendelian randomization.
observational
suggesting that low serum cholesterol levels were associated
with an increased risk of cancer, and thus that treatment to
lower cholesterol could have detrimental effects.10 This
association might be explained by early cancer lowering
cholesterol levels (reverse causality) or by confounding
factors (such as cigarette smoking), both of which are
related to future cancer risk and to lower circulating
cholesterol levels.11
Katan pointed out12 that polymorphic forms of the
apolipoprotein e (APOE) gene were related to different
average levels of serum cholesterol. If low circulating
cholesterol levels were indeed a causal factor for cancer,
individuals with the genotype associated with lower average
cholesterol levels should be expected to have higher cancer
risk. If, however, reverse causation or confounding
generated the association between low cholesterol levels
and cancer, then no association would be expected between
the APOE genotype and cancer. Individuals with lower
cholesterol because of their genotype, rather than because
existing clinically unrecognized cancers had lowered their
cholesterol, would not have a higher risk of cancer; nor
would there be substantial confounding between genotypeassociated differences in cholesterol levels and lifestyle or
socio-economic factors. Although Katan did not have any
data to investigate these possibilities, he advocated a study
design taking these considerations into account.12
As far as I am aware, Katan’s intriguing suggestion has
not yet been explicitly applied to address the important
question he posed, although sporadic reports relating APOE
to risk of speciﬁc cancers continue to appear.13–17
However, several examples where the phenotypic effects
of polymorphisms are well-documented provide encouraging evidence of the explanatory power of Mendelian
randomization.8,18,19

WHY THE TERM ‘MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION’?
Gregor Mendel (1822–1884) concluded from his hybridization studies with pea plants that ‘the behaviour of each pair
of differentiating characteristics [such as the shape and
colour of seeds] in hybrid union is independent of the other
differences between the two original plants’.20 This
formulation was actually the only regularity that Mendel
referred to as a ‘law’. In Carl Correns’ 1900 paper (one of a
trio appearing that year which are considered to represent
the rediscovery of Mendel) he refers to this as Mendel’s
Morgan23 discusses independent assortment and refers
to this process as being realized ‘whenever two pairs of
characters freely Mendelize’. Morgan’s use of Mendel’s
surname as a verb did not catch on, but Morgan later
christened this Mendel’s Second Law,24 and it has been
known by this name, or as ‘The Law of Independent
Assortment’, ever since. The law suggests that inheritance
of one trait is independent of—that is, randomized with
respect to—the inheritance of other traits.
The analogy with a randomized controlled trial will
clearly be most applicable to parent–offspring designs
investigating the frequency with which one of two alleles
from a heterozygous parent is transmitted to offspring with
a particular disease. However, at a population level, traits
inﬂuenced by genetic variants are generally not associated
with the social, behavioural and environmental factors that
confound relationships observed in conventional epidemiological
‘randomization’
approximate and not absolute in genetic association studies,
empirical observations suggest that it applies in most
circumstances.25,26
As discussed above, the term ‘Mendelian randomization’
itself was introduced by Gray and Wheatley in a somewhat
different context, in which advantage is taken of the random
assortment of genetic variants at conception to provide an
unconfounded study design for estimating treatment effects
for childhood malignancies.1,27 However, the term has
recently become widely used with the meaning ascribed to
The notion that genetic variants can serve as an indicator
of the action of environmentally modiﬁable exposures has
been expressed in many contexts. For example, since the
mid-1960s various investigators have pointed out that the
autosomal dominant condition of lactase persistence is
associated with milk drinking. Associations of lactase
persistence with osteoporosis, bone mineral density or
fracture risk thus provide evidence that milk drinking
protects against these conditions.28,29 In a related vein, it
was proposed in 1979 that as N-acetyltransferase pathways
are involved in the detoxiﬁcation of arylamine, a potential
bladder carcinogen, the observation of increased bladder
cancer risk among people with genetically determined slow
acetylator phenotype provided evidence that arylamines are
involved in the aetiology of the disease.30
Since that time various commentators have pointed out
that the associations of genetic variants of known function
with disease outcomes provides evidence about aetiological
factors.31–35 However, these commentators have not
emphasized the key strengths of Mendelian randomization:
the avoidance of confounding, bias due to reverse causation
or reporting tendency, and the underestimation of risk
associations due to variability in behaviours and phenotypes.18
These key concepts were present in Martijn Katan’s
1986 Lancet letter in which he suggested that genetic
variants related to cholesterol level could be used to
investigate whether the observed association between low
cholesterol and increased cancer risk was real,12 and by
Honkanen and colleagues in their understanding of how
lactase persistence could better characterize the difﬁcult-tomeasure environmental inﬂuence of calcium intake than
could direct dietary reports.36 Since 2000 there have been
several reports using the term ‘Mendelian randomization’ in
the way it is used here,8,37–40 and its use is becoming
widespread. The fact that Mendelian randomization is one
of a family of techniques referred to as ‘instrumental
variable’ approaches for obtaining robust causal inferences
from observational data has also been recognized,41 and
statistical approaches to instrumental variables analysis
developed within econometrics have been applied to data
from Mendelian randomization studies.25,42
