Demand Driven
Acquisition (DDA)
Build your collection with ebooks
that reflect user needs
Demand-Driven Acquisition
(DDA), pioneered by
ProQuest nearly two
decades ago, enables libraries
to offer on-demand access to
a vast selection of ebooks.
With this flexible acquisition
model, users can instantly
access thousands of titles,
enhancing their learning and
research experiences.
Purchases or loans are
triggered only after a
meaningful user engagement
or actions like downloading or
printing, making it a win-win
for both libraries and users.
By tapping into real-time user
needs, DDA helps libraries
build collections that are both
relevant and cost-effective.
Librarians can manage DDA
programs through Ebook
Central, Rialto, and OASIS.

Why Demand-Driven Acquisition (DDA)?
Maximize your
budget efficiency
With DDA, libraries can
select from over 2 million
titles, offering users
broad ebook access while
directing funds to materials
that are actively utilized.
Libraries can establish
specific price rules, set
spending limits, automate
budget tracking and
create customizable alerts
to help ensure balanced
budgeting.
DDA empowers you to
build a collection that truly
reflects the needs of your
academic community.
Create user-centric
collections
Maintain full control
over acquisitions
Enhance access
and ownership
Innovative models like
Access to Own (ATO)*
enable you to grow your
ebook collections by
applying loan expenditures
toward perpetual
purchases.
As your library evolves,
DDA can easily scale to
accommodate new trends
and emerging subjects in
academic research.
Mediated DDA allows
libraries to make datadriven decisions and
maintain control over
title selection, with staff
approval required for all
acquisitions.
Utilize data-driven
Ensure scalability
and adaptability
*ATO, exclusive to ProQuest, attributes library loan spending to title ownership.

Traditional DDA
Titles are only triggered for
purchase or loan if used, and
librarians have complete
control over the subjects,
publishers, cost, publication
dates and other parameters for
their consideration pools.
Short-Term Loans (STL)
As part of their DDA programs,
libraries can choose to take
affordable STLs without
commitment to purchase. Most
libraries offer these just-in-time
rentals to provide immediate
access that users expect,
however STLs can also be
Access-to-Own (ATO)
A mix of traditional DDA and
STL where loan fees contribute
towards buying the book.
Librarians have complete
control over their selection
pools, which are immediately
discoverable and accessible
to researchers, and loans are
only purchased if ebooks are
used. For libraries that prefer
ownership, ATO is a useful

needs to be because they’re
the ones who use it and know
what they require.”

Pioneered by ProQuest, Extended Access prevents turnaways
on limited user titles. It allows libraries to upgrade to multiuser access, take an STL, or purchase another copy when
an ebook is in use. Extended Access can be automated or
mediated, offering flexibility for budget-conscious libraries
and limited access models.
“Using DDA allows us to
understand patron needs more
directly, which means we are
spending our funds on content
that better fills their needs
and that is ultimately what is
important.”

Why librarians love
Demand Driven Acquisition
“We have compared usage
expenditures of DDA
purchases and short-term loans
with past spending and usage
patterns. So far, we have found
that while spending is slightly
increased, usage has been
greatly increased.”
