Introduction
Osteoporosis is an important yet underdiagnosed and
undertreated bone disease whose direct and indirect
costs are estimated to substantially increase in the coming
decades.1–4 As such, efforts to increase osteoporosis
screening and treatment are important for reducing the
impending global public health burden of fragility fractures. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the most
widely used screening tool for low bone mineral density
(BMD), but its planar nature precludes direct trabecular
assessment of the spine. An additional opportunity for
osteoporosis screening exists using bone data obtained
from body CT scans, which are frequently performed in
older adults for a wide variety of indications.5–10 In particular, manual CT-based L1 trabecular attenuation measurements have been shown to correlate with DXA-based BMD
categories, is predictive of future fragility fractures, and
this level is imaged on both thoracic and abdominal CT
scans.11,12
Advances in radiology image processing have the potential to provide fully automated measurements of CT-based
images that are more objective than manual human
measures, and can be applied to larger patient cohorts.13–15
In this study, we implemented an image-processing algorithm that performs automatic volumetric segmentation of
the lumbar trabecular space on CT scans and then estimates

Objective: To validate a fully automated CT-based spinal
trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) tool and apply it
to a longitudinal screening cohort.
Methods: The automated BMD tool was retrospectively
applied to non-contrast abdominal CT scans in 1603
consecutive asymptomatic adults (mean age, 55.9 years;
770 M/833 F) undergoing longitudinal screening (mean
interval, 5.7 years; range, 1.0–12.3 years). The spinal
column was automatically segmented, with standardized L1 and L2 anterior trabecular ROI placement. Automated and manual L1 HU values were compared, as were
automated supine-prone measures. L1-L2 CT attenuation values were converted to BMD values through a
linear regression model. BMD values and changes were
assessed according to age and gender.
Results: Success rate of the automated BMD tool was
99.8 % (four failed cases). Both automated supine vs
prone and manual vs automated L1 attenuation measurements showed good agreement. Overall mean annual
rate of bone loss was greater in females than males
(–2.0% vs −1.0%), but the age-specific rate declined
faster in females from age 50 (–2.1%) to age 65 (–0.3%)
compared with males (–0.9% to −0.5%). Mean BMD was
higher in females than males at age 50 (143.6 vs 135.1  mg
cm–3), but post-menopausal bone loss in females
reversed this relationship beyond age 60. By age 70,
mean BMD in females and males was 100.8 and 107.7  mg
cm–3 , respectively.
Conclusion: This robust, fully automated CT BMD tool
allows for both individualized and population-based
assessment. Mean BMD was lower in men than women
accelerated
post-menopausal
bone loss in women resulted in lower values beyond
Advances in knowledge: This fully automated tool can
be applied to routine abdominal CT scans for prospective or retrospective opportunistic BMD assessment,
including change over time. Mean BMD was lower in men
compared with women aged 50–60 years, but accelerated bone loss in women during this early post-menopausal period resulted in lower BMD values for women
beyond age 60.

BMD. Utilizing a large, unique CT-based adult screening cohort
undergoing longitudinal colonography assessment,16 we sought
to validate this BMD tool, including both measurement fidelity
and objective population-based assessment according to age and
gender over time.
Methods and materials
Patient population
This was a HIPAA-compliant retrospective cohort study
performed at a single academic medical center. The need for
patient consent was waived by the IRB. Asymptomatic, generally
healthy outpatient adults aged 50–70 years at the time of their
initial screening CT colonography (CTC) study, and who had at
least two CTC studies over time at the University of Wisconsin
between January 2004 and March 2017, were eligible for inclusion. For patients with more than one follow-up CTC, the initial
and last scans were utilized for primary analysis. Patients whose
scans were performed less than 1 year apart were excluded as
relevant decreases in BMD would be less likely over such a short
follow-up period. A total of 1607 patients were initially eligible
for inclusion. We also searched the electronic medical records
of included patients for evidence of osteoporosis screening with
central DXA (spine and/or hips), either before or after their
initial CT examination used in this study.
Age at initial CT, length of time between CT studies, and gender
were collected as exposure variables. After excluding four failed
cases, the final cohort consisted of 1603 adults (833 females and
770 males), with a mean age at initial CT of 55.9 ± 5.0 years.
The mean interval to follow-up CT was 5.7 ± 1.9 years (range,
1.0–12.3 years). Outcome variables were the automated CT-derived L1 trabecular attenuation values [in Hounsfield units
(HU)] and the calculated BMD values, which were based on the
average trabecular HU at L1 and L2.
CT image acquisition
Per standard CTC screening technique,17,18 breath-hold supine
and prone acquisitions were performed without i.v. contrast
on a variety of 8–64 channel multidetector CT scanners (GE
Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). These CT scanners undergo daily
QA, including HU calibration testing. Scan parameters included
1.25 mm collimation and slice thickness, 120 kV, variable
low-dose mAs settings, and 1 mm reconstruction interval. The
1.25 mm supine series was utilized for primary BMD analysis,
include rate of change over time; prone series BMD measurements were also obtained for intra patient comparison.
Automated trabecular spine segmentation and
BMD estimation
A fully automated method was developed to segment the trabecular spine from CT images, which was developed and tested on a
separate patient cohort.19 The CT images were sent offline from
PACS for anonymization prior to accessing the BMD tool. The
algorithm first extracts the spinal column based on thresholding,
region growing, watershed, and directed graph search. Second,
the segmented spinal column is then partitioned into individual vertebrae using curved planar reformation and dynamic
programming. For each vertebral body, the cortical bone was
automatically eroded to isolate the trabecular space.
An oval region of interest (ROI) was automatically placed in the
middle transverse (axial) cross-sections of extracted L1 and L2
vertebrae (Figure 1). The location of the ROI was set at the anterior one-third of the anteroposterior center axis of the vertebral
body, to simulate the established manual method.11,20,21 The size
of the ROI was standardized at one-half of the vertebral body
lateral width by one-fourth of the vertebral body anteroposterior height, using a single slice at the vertebral midline. Mean
HU values were calculated within the ROIs for L1 and L2 and
converted to BMD estimation through a linear regression model
trained by a set of QCT images with calibration phantoms.

30% loss, or annual mean rate of BMD change of −3%/year. Note also the significant interval weight loss. 3D, three-dimensional;

Full paper: Validation of fully automated CT-based BMD assessment
To estimate BMD from HU, we used a previously derived calibration curve obtained from phantoms used in dedicated QCT
scans, which demonstrated excellent correlation (r2 = 0.98).19
The curve maps CT attenuation in HUs to BMD in milligrams
per milliliter.
Comparison of manual and automated trabecular
attenuation values
To further assess the automated L1 HU measurement, we
compared manual L1 attenuation measurements in a random
subset of 588 patients, using a previously validated method, with
placement of a single ROI in the anterior L1 trabecular space,
just off the mid-vertebral level.8,11,21
Statistical analysis
Annual rate of change in BMD was assessed in overall and
percentage-based terms. The rate of annual BMD change was
estimated by calculating the difference between initial and
follow-up BMD and dividing it by the scan interval in years
(Figure 1). The full patient range at initial CT (50–70 years) was
utilized for age-specific BMD values; age-specific rates of BMD
loss were considered for the 50–65 year-old range, as there were
insufficient data points for rates of change beyond 65 years.
Intrapatient comparison between automated L1 HU values on
the supine and prone CT series were compared as an internal
quality assurance measure in a subset of 2851 CT scans. For
all other purposes, BMD values for the supine CT series were
utilized. Multivariate linear regression was performed to estimate the effects of age and gender on annual change in BMD
and to model expected annual change in BMD. Interaction of the
effects of age and gender on outcome variables were included in
the regression analyses. Bland-Altman analysis was utilized for
comparing manual and automated L1 attenuation measurement,
and for comparing automated supine and prone BMD measurements. In addition, the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient (r2, the correlation of determination) was derived for these
comparisons. All statistical analyses were performed using R
software (R Core Development Team, v3.3.2).
QA performance of the BMD algorithm
The automated BMD tool successfully derived an L1 HU and
BMD value in 99.8% (1603/1607) of cases. There was good
agreement (r2 = 0.90) between the automated supine and prone
BMD measurements (Figure 2), with a mean difference of −0.15
mg cm–3, without bias. Bland–Altman 95% limits of agreement
were −21.7 to 21.4 mg cm–3. In the subset of 588 patients, supine
manual and automated L1 attenuation measurements also showed
good linear agreement (Figure 3; r2 = 0.80). The Bland–Altman
95% limits of agreement for the attenuation difference were
−32.8 to 22.4 HU. Automated L1 attenuation measurements were
slightly increased relative to manual measurements by 5.2 HU on
average, without bias.
BMD change over time at CT
Overall results for the entire cohort, not stratified by age, are
shown on Table 1. The overall mean annual change in BMD was
−2.0% per year in females and −1.0% per year in males (−1.5% per
year for the entire cohort). However, a deeper understanding is
gained when the results are stratified by age and gender (Table 2).
As expected, mean BMD decreased with increasing age from 50
to 70 years for both males and females (Figure 4). Mean BMD in
females was higher than males at 50 years of age (143.6 vs 135.1
mgcm-3), but accelerated post-menopausal bone loss in females
reversed this relationship beyond 60 years of age. However,
the rate of bone loss progressively declined more rapidly with
increasing age in females compared with males (Figure 5). By
65 years of age, the mean rate of annual bone loss was slightly
greater in males compared with females (−0.5%/year vs −0.3%/
year). By 70 years of age, mean BMD in females and males was
100.8 and 107.7 mg cm–3, respectively. Age at initial CT, sex,
and their interaction term were all significantly associated (p <
0.001) with mean BMD at initial CT, annual mean rate of change

Clinical osteoporosis screening with DXA
A total of 377 patients underwent DXA for osteoporosis
screening prior to their initial CT screening study, corresponding
to 23.5% (377/1603) of the cohort. Another 17.3% (278/1603) of
patients underwent DXA study after the date of the initial CT
study. Nearly 90% of patients screened with DXA were females.
To date, 59.1% (948/1603) of patients from this study have not
been screened by DXA.
Discussion
In this study, we determined annual age- and gender-specific
rates of trabecular spine BMD change in an adult screening
cohort using fully automated CT-based software. We found that
annual rates of BMD loss peaked in females ages 50–55 years,
corresponding to the early post-menopausal period (mean age
of menopause in females is 51 years). This is in agreement with
prior DXA22 and qCT23–25 data that demonstrated accelerated bone loss in females during late perimenopause and early
post-menopause. Prior to this accelerated post-menopausal
BMD loss in females, we found that age-matched males actually

have lower lumbar trabecular BMD than females, on average.
Although not widely appreciated, this lower BMD level in males
has been previously shown for adults in the third decade of life.26
We also found that rates of BMD loss progressively slowed after
menopause in females, which is also in accordance with previously published results. In combination, these data stress the
potential importance and possible preventive opportunity for
this accelerated BMD loss seen in the early post-menopausal
period in females. Because these changes occur before the age
of recommended osteoporosis screening, other interventions
might be considered.
Perhaps more important than redemonstrating normative
BMD levels and rates of BMD loss according to age and gender
is the fact that all our CT-based measurements were obtained
automatically without reader input. This robust automated
tool, representing an improvement over an earlier version,19
demonstrated a very low failure rate, and correlated well with
the manual L1 trabecular ROI measurements. Manual L1 HU
measures have been previously validated for clinical important
outcomes,6,8,11,12,20 and are now being used every day in our
routine clinical practice to provide opportunistic BMD information. Use of an automated tool could greatly expand utilization
of this opportunistic screening approach, and enhance the value
of our CT interpretations. In addition, this tool could be applied
retrospectively within a group or practice to provide population-based screening. As we have shown, there is a substantial
subset of patients who may otherwise not be screened by DXA,
and opportunistic screening with CT could therefore have a
meaningful impact. Although one could argue that many of
these patients were not yet of the recommended age for osteoporosis screening, many osteoporotic fractures occur prior to initial
DXA screening. Furthermore, the majority of patients undergoing DXA who have a fragility fracture will have a non-osteoporotic T-score (i.e. greater than −1.0),11 which may relate in
part to the planar nature of DXA. As a volumetric cross-sectional
imaging technique, CT is able to directly assess the trabecular
bone without the issues of overlying cortical bone and degenerative changes.

In general, rapid advances in artificial intelligence and machine
learning applied to cross-sectional imaging could eventually lead
to fully automated measurements that provide objective assessment to complement a radiologist’s interpretation.13–15 Beyond
this BMD tool, we are currently investigating a number of
abdominal CT-based machine learning algorithms to automatically measure abdominal aortic calcification, hepatic attenuation, muscle mass for sarcopenia, and visceral and subcutaneous
fat. While potentially providing useful information in isolation,
the combination of these tools could conceivably synergize to
provide meaningful cardiometabolic risk assessment and stratification. In addition, a companion machine learning algorithm for
automatically detecting vertebral compression fractures was not
applied in this study but could be used in concert with automated
BMD assessment.27
One strength of our study design was the relatively unique longitudinal CT series in an asymptomatic screening cohort, which
was ideal for applying this automated tool to assess for age- and
gender-based differences in BMD values and rates of BMD loss.
In addition, CT has intrinsic advantages over the clinical standard of DXA, which is a planar technique that cannot directly
assess the spinal trabecular space. However, we also acknowledge limitations of the current study. The small but measurable
increased offset in automated L1 attenuation over 5 HU over the
manual technique likely relates to placement of the automated
ROI in the central aspect of the anterior trabecular space, where
a stripe of increased linear density can be seen on sagittal CT
reconstructions and at gross anatomy.28 In addition, one would
expect some offset in HU measurements between supine and
prone measurements given the known effects related to positional changes within the scanner.29 The phantomless technique with calibration on one scanner in a limited data set could
potentially lead to inaccuracies or variability in the conversions
from HU to mg/cc. However, HU values are calibrated as part of
daily quality control, and a recent study found that phantomless
BMD results based on HU values represent good estimates
across different scanners.30 We did not investigate the impact
of other risk factors, such as those included in the FRAX tool,31
nor did we search for prevalent or incident factures, all of which
would require a detailed patient-by-patient search. We plan to
investigate the predictive ability of this automated BMD tool by
applying it to a large retrospective cohort both with and without
future fragility fractures.
In conclusion, this fully automated BMD tool can be applied
opportunistically to routine abdominal CT scans for prospective
clinical or retrospective population-based assessments, including
monitoring changes over time.
Numbers in parentheses represent 95% confidence intervals.
Accelerated bone loss in the early post-menopausal period in
females leads to overall lower BMD values beyond age 60. Note,
however, that the rate of BMD loss progressively decreases faster
in females than in males, resulting a lower rate of BMD loss by
age 65. Data for rates of change beyond age 65 were too sparse
for accurate reporting.
Plots using lines of best fit show that females demonstrate accelerated bone loss over the post-menopausal 50–60 year age range,
but that this rate of loss progressively declines faster than males.
Shaded areas around lines correspond to 95% CIs for the mean
annual rate of BMD change.
