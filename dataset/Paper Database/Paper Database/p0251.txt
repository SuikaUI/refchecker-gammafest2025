Early identification and accurate diagnosis play a crucial role in effective malaria treatment. However, underdiagnosis presents a significant challenge in reducing mortality rates, and traditional laboratory diagnosis methods have limitations in terms of time consumption and error susceptibility. To overcome these challenges, researchers haveincreasingly utilized Machine Learning techniques, specifically neural networks, which provide faster, cost-effective, and highly accurate diagnostic capabilities.Methods:This study aimed to compare the performance of a traditional neural network (NN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) in the diagnosis and classification of different types of malaria using blood smear images. We curated a comprehensive malaria dataset comprising 1,920 images obtained from 84 patients suspected of having various malaria strains. The dataset consisted of 624 images of Falciparum, 548 images of Vivax, 588 images of Ovale, and 160 images from suspected healthy individuals, obtained from local hospitals in Iran. To ensure precise analysis, we developed a unique segmentation model that effectively eliminated therapeutically beneficial cells from the image context, enabling accurate analysis using artificial intelligence algorithms.Results: The evaluation of the traditional NN and the proposed 6-layer CNN model for image classification yielded average accuracies of 95.11% and 99.59%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the CNN, as a primary algorithm of deep neural networks (DNN), outperforms the traditional NN in analyzing different classes of malaria images. TheCNN model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance, delivering enhanced accuracy and reliability in the classifying of malaria cases.Conclusion:This research underscores the potential of ML technologies, specifically CNNs, in improving malaria diagnosis and classification. By leveraging advanced image analysis techniques, including the developed segmentation model, CNN showcased remarkable proficiency in accurately identifying and classifying various malaria parasites from blood smear images. The adoption of machine learning-based approachesholds promise for more effective management and treatment of malaria, addressing the challenges of underdiagnosis and improving patient outcomes.Keywords:Malaria Parasites,Image ProcessingArtificial Neural NetworkDeep LearningConvolutional Neural Network*Corresponding authors:Hamidreza Rokhsati Email: GhaderzadehEmail: cite this article as:Fasihfar Z, Rokhsati H, Sadeghsalehi H, Ghaderzadeh M, Gheisari M.AI-driven malaria diagnosis: developing a robust model for accurate detection and classification of malaria parasites.Iranian Journal ofBlood and Cancer. 2023;15(3):112-124.
Өstands for orienting the regular stripes to parallel stripes of the Gabor function. Ψrefers to the stage offset of the sinusoidal function. In addition, σ is the sigma or standard deviation of the Gaussian envelope. Finally,
ɣrepresents the spatial aspect ratio and determines the support elasticity of the Gabor function.Therefore, consideration of a set of Gabor filters containing diverse frequencies and orientations can bebeneficial in extracting the advantageous features of the images. Thus, in the discrete domain, 2D Gabor filters are expressed as (Eq. 9 and 10):Where B and C refer to the normalizing factors that should be estimated, notably, two-dimensional Gabor filters are highly used to process the images, particularly in extracting the features toanalyze and segment the texture, as Fig 4 illustrates.After segmenting the images and obtaining the segmented image that includes essential blood components for malaria diagnosis and classification. These images need a classifier to classify the featuresin the next step. In this research, we used two standard classifiers in classifying features of malaria parasite images. The reason for using these two classifiers was their acceptable performance in previous studies.Based on the research design, each image has been read into MATLAB. Then, the images

have been resized and serialized for generating the input to the MatConvnettoolbox. It should be mentioned that before running data to the CNN network for training, normalization has been used for improving the local contrast and brightness and whitening the whole dataset through an eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) operation on the covariance matrix.3.ResultTwo models were used in the present study. Both models were tuned after the initial design, and their hyperparameters were adjusted to optimize them to reach an optimal model. 3.1. Performance MetricsThe sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy evaluationcriteria were established based on the model's performance using a confusion matrix to objectively assess the efficacy of the chosen method. Sensitivity in this context was outlined as the proportion of infected cases that the model accurately identified to all actual malaria cases. The ratio of accuratelyidentified non-infected cases as all real non-infectedcases define specificity. Accuracy was further defined as the percentage of all malaria-infected and non-infected cases that were correctly identified from the blood pictures. The formulas of the evaluation criteria are given in equations

These metrics' values are displayed in the Table 8.The performance metrics of the two models are compared in Figure 6. A quick look at the chart reveals that the CNN network outperformed in detecting various types of malaria parasites and distinguishing between these classes.After analyzing all the evaluation criteria values, it was concluded that the method suggested by the CNN algorithm performed better in identifying and classification various types of malaria. This improved performance is thought to be the automatic extraction of image features.4.Conclusion and Feature WorkThe approaches employed in the current study include several segmentation techniques, normalizationand
