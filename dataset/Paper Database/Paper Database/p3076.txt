Recent work in natural language generation has begun to take linguistic variation into account,
developing algorithms that are capable of modifying the system’s linguistic style based either
on the user’s linguistic style or other factors, such as personality or politeness. While stylistic
control has traditionally relied on handcrafted rules, statistical methods are likely to be needed for
generation systems to scale to the production of the large range of variation observed in human
dialogues. Previous work on statistical natural language generation (SNLG) has shown that the
grammaticality and naturalness of generated utterances can be optimized from data; however
these data-driven methods have not been shown to produce stylistic variation that is perceived
by humans in the way that the system intended. This paper describes PERSONAGE, a highly
parameterizable language generator whose parameters are based on psychological ﬁndings about
the linguistic reﬂexes of personality. We present a novel SNLG method which uses parameter
estimation models trained on personality-annotated data to predict the generation decisions
required to convey any combination of scalar values along the ﬁve main dimensions of personality. A human evaluation shows that parameter estimation models produce recognizable stylistic
variation along multiple dimensions, on a continuous scale, and without the computational cost
incurred by overgeneration techniques.
1. Introduction
Although language can be seen as simply a method for exchanging information, it also
has a social function . Speakers use linguistic
cues to project social aspects of utterances, such as the speaker’s personality, emotions,
and social group, and hearers use these cues to infer properties about the speaker.
Although some cues appear to be produced through automatic cognitive processes
 , speakers may also overload their

communicative intentions to try to satisfy multiple goals simultaneously , such as projecting a speciﬁc image to the hearer
while communicating information and minimizing communicative effort . The combination of these pragmatic effects
results in the large range of linguistic variation observed between individual speakers
 .
Much of the research on generating utterances that manifest different linguistic
styles has focused on text generation applications such as journalistic writing or instruction manuals . Recent research in language generation for dialogue applications has also begun to take linguistic variation into account, developing algorithms
to modify the system’s linguistic style based on either the user’s linguistic style, or other
factors such as the user’s emotional state, her personality, or considerations of politeness
strategies .
There is growing evidence that dialogue systems such as intelligent tutoring systems
are more effective if they can generate a range of different types of stylistic linguistic
variation . Most
of this work uses either templates or handcrafted rules to generate utterances. This
guarantees high quality, natural outputs, which is useful for demonstrating the utility
of stylistic variation.
Handcrafted approaches mean that utterances have to be constructed by hand
for each new application, however, leading to problems of portability and scalability
 . Statistical natural language generation (SNLG)
has the potential to address such scalability issues by relying on annotated data rather
than manual parameter tuning. It also offers the promise of techniques for producing
continuous stylistic variation over multiple stylistic factors by automatically learning a
model of the relation between stylistic factors and properties (parameters) of generated
utterances . It is difﬁcult to produce such continuous
variation over multiple factors with a rule-based or template-based approach . Moreover, to date, no one has shown that
humans correctly perceive the generated variation as the system intended, nor has
anyone shown that an SNLG approach can produce outputs that are natural enough to
be used in dialogue applications such as intelligent tutoring systems, interactive drama
systems, and conversational agents, where some types of stylistic variation have already
been shown to be useful.
In previous work, we argue that the Big Five model of personality provides a
useful framework for modeling some types of stylistic linguistic variation. This model
of human personality has become widely accepted in psychology over the last 50 years
 . Table 1 tabulates each Big Five trait along with some of the important
trait adjectives associated with the extremes of each trait. We believe that these trait
adjectives provide an intuitive, meaningful deﬁnition of linguistic style. In previous
work we describe a rule-based version of PERSONAGE, which here we will refer to as
PERSONAGE-RB . In PERSONAGE-RB, generation parameters are implemented, and their values are set based on correlations between linguistic cues and the Big Five traits that have been systematically documented
in the psychology literature . For example, parameters for the extraversion

trait include verbosity, sentence length, and the production of positive content. We
showed experimentally that humans perceive utterances generated by PERSONAGE-RB
as conveying the extremes of all Big Five traits (e.g., neuroticism (low) vs. emotionally
stable (high), see Table 1). Our evaluation uses a validated perceptual questionnaire
from the personality psychology literature .
PERSONAGE-RB only generates 10 discrete personalities emphasizing either the
high or the low end of one trait; however, psychologists measure personality traits
on continuous scales , and human
language simultaneously manifests multiple personality traits. Some computational
applications may require more than a small set of personality types, which suggests
that systems adapting their linguistic style to the user would beneﬁt from ﬁne-grained
personality models. We believe that the only way to robustly and efﬁciently learn such
ﬁne-grained variation is to model personality as a continuous variable, rather than using
arbitrary discrete personality classes. Personality generation models should thus learn
to map continuous target personality scores to discrete utterances. In order to achieve
this, the handcrafted rule-based approach would require the manual examination of
psycholinguistic ﬁndings, followed by testing in the application domain, to determine
the appropriate range for each parameter value. Extending this approach to continuous
variation that can project multiple traits simultaneously does not appear to be tractable.
The objective of this article is to present and evaluate a language generator that
is trained with a novel method, and which learns to generate stylistic variation expressing multiple continuous stylistic dimensions (in this case multiple personality traits).
Before presenting our method, let us review existing paradigms for statistical language
generation.
1.1 Previous Statistical Language Generation Methods
Previous work on SNLG has focused on three main approaches: (a) learning statistical language models (SLMs) from corpora in order to rerank a set of pre-generated
Downloaded from by guest on 26 March 2025
Computational Linguistics
Volume 37, Number 3
utterances; (b) learning utterance reranking models from user feedback rather than
corpora; and (c) learning generation parameters directly from data.
The ﬁrst approach has used SLMs to rerank a large set of candidate utterances, and
focused on grammaticality and naturalness . The seminal work of
Langkilde and Knight in this area showed that high quality paraphrases can be
generated from an underspeciﬁed representation of meaning, by ﬁrst applying a very
underconstrained, rule-based overgeneration phase, whose outputs are then ranked by
an SLM scoring phase. The SLM scoring gives a low score (rank) to any ungrammatical
output produced by the rule-based generator. We will refer to this as the overgenerate
and scoring (OS) approach.
In a novel twist, Isard, Brockmann, and Oberlander applied this method to
the generation of dialogues in which conversational agents with different personalities
discuss movies. The SLM ranking model blends SLMs from blogs annotated with Big
Five personality traits with SLMs from Switchboard, a much larger conversational
dialogue corpus. Their CRAG-2 generator discretizes the blog personality ratings into
three groups (low, medium, and high), and models personality with three distinct SLM
models for each trait. Each model estimates the likelihood of the utterance given the
personality type. A cache model based on recently used linguistic forms can also be
combined, in order to model recency effects and alignment . This approach was integrated into a demonstrator, but it does not generate
continuous variation (discretization of personality ratings), and to our knowledge it
has never been evaluated to test whether the variation produced is perceivable by
A second approach to SNLG is a variant of the OS technique that trains the scoring phase to replicate human judgments rather than relying on the probabilities or
frequencies of a SLM. This approach typically uses higher-level syntactic, semantic,
and discourse features rather than only n-grams, with typical results demonstrating
that the performance of the scoring models approaches the gold-standard human ranking with a relatively small training set . An advantage of this approach is that human
judgments can be based on any aspect of the output, such as stylistic differences in
politeness or personality. Walker et al. showed that this technique can be used
to model individual preferences in rhetorical structure, syntactic form, and content
In previous work, we also applied this method to scoring randomly produced
outputs of PERSONAGE . The resulting statistical generator is referred
to as PERSONAGE-OS. We randomly varied PERSONAGE’s non-deterministic decisions
points to generate a large number of paraphrases. We then computed post hoc features consisting of the actual generation decisions, surface word n-grams, and contentanalysis features from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool and the MRC psycholinguistic database . Example content-analysis features include the ratio of words related to positive emotions
(e.g., good), social interactions (e.g., pal), or the average frequency of use of each word.
Scoring models trained on personality ratings of random utterances (in-domain data)
outperformed the mean value baseline for all Big Five traits, with the best results for
agreeableness, extraversion, and emotional stability. The models for those traits predict
the ratings of unseen utterances with correlations of r = .52, r = .37, and r = .29, respectively. We also trained models on out-of-domain data, that is, 96 personality-annotated
conversation extracts (without any generation decision features). Results show that the

Trainable Generation of Personality Traits
out-of-domain models perform worse for all traits, only outperforming the baseline
for agreeableness and conscientiousness. We also explored several hybrid methods for
training that mix and blend data from different sources. Inspired by recent work on
domain adaptation, we tested whether the performance of the out-of-domain models
can be improved when training includes a small amount of data from the target domain, by applying the method of Daum´e . Whereas adding out-of-domain data
improved performance for some traits, we ﬁnd that adding a single domain feature performs as well as Daume’s method. The results showed that mixing randomly generated
in-domain utterances with rule-based in-domain utterances improves performance; the
rule-based utterances provide a way to incorporate knowledge from the personality
psychology literature into an SNLG approach. Thus, personality scoring models can
be effective, although the computational cost of the OS approach remains a major
The third SNLG approach estimates the generation parameters directly from data,
without any overgeneration phase. If the language generator is constrained to be a generative SLM, the parameters can then be learned through standard maximum-likelihood
estimation. Whereas n-gram SLMs can only model local linguistic phenomena, Belz
showed that a context-free grammar (PCFG) can successfully model individual differences in the production of weather reports . This method provides a
principled way to produce utterances matching the linguistic style of a speciﬁc corpus
(e.g., of an individual author) without any overgeneration phase. However, standard
PCFG generation methods require a treebank-annotated corpus, and they cannot model
context-dependent generation decisions, such as the control of sentence length or the
generation of referring expressions.
Paiva and Evans adopt a more general framework by learning a regression
model mapping generation decisions to stylistic dimensions extracted from a corpus,
independently of the language generation mechanism. Factors are identiﬁed by applying factor analysis to a corpus exhibiting stylistic variation, and expressed as a linear
combination of linguistic features . Textual outputs are generated with a
rule-based generator in the target domain that is allowed to randomly vary the generation parameters, while logging the parameter settings corresponding to each output.
Then the same factors found in the original corpus are measured in the random outputs,
and linear regression is applied to learn which generation parameters predict the factor
measurements. The generation parameters can then be manipulated to hit multiple
stylistic targets on a continuous scale (because factors are measured continuously) by
searching for the parameter setting yielding the target stylistic scores according to the
linear models. The generator of Paiva and Evans, trained in this way, can reproduce intended factor levels across several factors, such as sentence length and type of referring
expression, thus modeling the stylistic variation as measured in the original corpus.
Again, it has not been shown that humans perceive the stylistic differences that this
approach produces.
1.2 Parameter Estimation Models
In the previous sections, we referred to two existing methods for controlling the parameters of PERSONAGE to produce stylistic variation: PERSONAGE-RB uses handcrafted
generation parameter values for every target style of interest, and PERSONAGE-OS
uses a statistical rescoring model to rerank a set of randomly generated utterances.
The following sections develop and evaluate PERSONAGE-PE, a trainable generator

which uses a direct generation method inspired by Paiva and Evans’ approach , to
produce the stylistic variation found in personality traits, without any overgeneration
phase. Whereas Paiva and Evans learn models predicting the target stylistic scores from
the generation parameters, we train parameter estimation models (PE) to estimate the
optimal generation parameters given target personality scores, which are then used by
the base generator to produce the output utterance. As parameter estimation models
learn the reverse relationship to Paiva and Evans’ regression models, there is no need
to search for the optimal generation parameter values at generation time. We evaluate
the PE approach using the PERSONAGE base generator, whose parameters, architecture,
and capabilities are described in Section 2. Our experimental method is described in
Section 3, together with an analysis of the data required to train our models. Section 4
analyzes some of the learned models, and evaluates the quality of the generated outputs
using human judges, to compare our approach with the handcrafted PERSONAGE-RB
generator of our previous work. Finally, Section 5 discusses the implications of our
results and suggests many areas of future work.
This article makes several contributions. First, we present a novel method for training an SNLG system that can produce multiple stylistic dimensions simultaneously,
over continuous dimensions, without overgeneration or search. In order to evaluate our
approach, we present the ﬁrst empirical results showing that humans correctly perceive
the stylistic variations (of any kind based on any utterance dimensions) that a statistical
language generator intended to produce. Our evaluation of PERSONAGE-RB is the only
other result that we know of for non-statistical generators .
Our experiments show that PERSONAGE-PE produces utterances perceived by humans
as portraying different personalities, while maintaining a reasonable naturalness level
(4.0 on a scale of 1 to 7). We do not know of any other human evaluation of an
SNLG system that produces stylistic variation. Additionally, we test a wide range of
machine learning algorithms to determine the best model for each generation decision
in Section 4.1. We are not aware of any other work on SNLG to test such a wide range
of algorithms.
2. The PERSONAGE Base Generator
The architecture of the PERSONAGE base generator is shown in Figure 1; it is discussed
in detail in and , and is only brieﬂy summarized here.
The PERSONAGE architecture (Figure 1) builds on a standard natural language
generation (NLG) pipeline architecture as described in Reiter and Dale , Kittredge,
Korelsky, and Rambow , and Walker and Rambow . We assume that the
inputs to the generator are (1) a high-level communicative goal; (2) a content pool that
can be used to achieve that goal, and (3) a set of generation parameter values. In a
dialogue system, the communicative goal is provided by the dialogue manager. Two
types of communicative goals are currently supported by PERSONAGE: recommendation
and comparison of restaurants. PERSONAGE’s content pool is based on a database of
restaurants in New York City, with associated scalar values representing evaluative
ratings for six attributes: food quality, service, cuisine, location, price, and atmosphere.
The ﬁrst component of the architecture shown in Figure 1 is the content planner,
which speciﬁes the structure of the information to be conveyed. The resulting content
plan tree is then processed by the sentence planner, which selects syntactic templates
for expressing individual propositions, and aggregates them to produce the utterance’s

full syntactic structure. The pragmatic marker insertion component then modiﬁes the
syntactic structure locally to produce various pragmatic effects, depending on the markers’ insertion constraints. The lexical choice component selects the most appropriate
lexeme for each content word, given the lexical selection parameters. Finally, the Real-
Pro surface realizer converts the ﬁnal syntactic structure
into a string by applying surface grammatical rules, such as morphological inﬂection
and function word insertion. When integrated into a dialogue system, the output of the
realizer is annotated for prosodic information by the prosody assigner before being sent
to the text-to-speech engine to be converted into an acoustic signal. PERSONAGE does
not currently express personality through prosody, although there are studies that could
be used to develop such parameters .
Figure 1 also indicates the modules in which PERSONAGE introduces parameters to
produce and control personality-based linguistic variation. The generation parameters
are shown in Table 2 and organized into blocks that correspond to the modules of the
architecture in Figure 1; compare Figure 1 to Table 2. As mentioned previously, all
of PERSONAGE’s parameters are motivated by ﬁndings in the personality psychology
literature. The mapping from a ﬁnding to parameters represents a set of hypotheses
about how the ﬁnding can be implemented, however, as discussed in more detail in
Mairesse and Walker and Mairesse .
Table 2 includes a description for each parameter that explains what the parameter
does and often includes an example. For example, there are 12 content planning parameters shown in the ﬁrst block of Table 2; these control aspects of utterances such as their
verbosity, rhetorical structure, content selection parameters such as positive content,
and the level of redundancy and restatement . Table 2 also includes 13
pragmatic marker parameters, which we believe to be completely novel. These include
the introduction of HEDGES and TAG QUESTIONS. We are not aware of any other generators that produce the range of pragmatic variation illustrated here. Note also that

PERSONAGE’s generation parameters. The Type column indicates whether the stylistic effect is
modeled as a continuous (C) or binary (B) parameter (i.e., resulting in continuous or binary
parameter estimation models). Aggregation operation parameters are selection probabilities (C).

Figure 1 indicates that the lexical choice parameters in Table 2 make use of multiple online lexical resources such as WordNet and VERBOCEAN to support lexical variation.
The LEXICAL FREQUENCY parameter is calculated with respect to a corpus.
Furthermore, whereas some parameters primarily have a linear effect on an utterance (e.g., verbosity), other parameters are highly non-linear (e.g., the effect of inserting
two expletives rather than one is not as strong as the effect of inserting one expletive
rather than none). Parameters are therefore modeled as having either continuous (C) or
binary (B) values, as illustrated in column Type of Table 2. The models for continuous
Downloaded from by guest on 26 March 2025
Computational Linguistics

and binary parameters are trained using different algorithms. Section 3 will provide
examples of learned models of both types.
In addition, because generation decisions can be non-deterministic, some continuous parameter values are generation decision probabilities; for example, the input
to aggregation parameters such as CONJUNCTION is the probability that the aggregation operation is selected to combine any pair of propositions in the utterance (e.g.,
CONJUNCTION aggregates two propositions with the conjunction and). If the propositions cannot be aggregated because of syntactic constraints, another aggregation
operation is sampled until the aggregation is successful. Complete details on the implementation of individual parameters can be found in Mairesse and Mairesse
and Walker .
To make PERSONAGE as domain-independent as possible, the input parameter
values are normalized between 0 and 1 for continuous parameters, and to 0 or 1 for
binary parameters. For example, a VERBOSITY parameter of 1 maximizes the utterance’s
verbosity given the input, regardless of the actual number of propositions expressed.
In order to ensure naturalness over the full parameter range, the maximum value of
some continuous parameters is associated with an input-independent threshold (e.g.,
there cannot be more than two repeated propositions per utterance). Although the
goal of the base generator is to satisfy its input parameters, it cannot guarantee that
all input parameter values will be reﬂected in the utterance due to constraints on
the input content plan and other parameters. A consequence is that non-deterministic
decision points are introduced to satisfy these naturalness constraints (e.g., if too many
pragmatic marker parameters are enabled, only a random subset will appear in the
utterance). Therefore, the only assumption we make regarding the impact of parameter
values on the generation process is that they affect the likelihood of observing their
intended effect over a large set of utterances.
3. Generation of Personality through Data-Driven Parameter Estimation
Whereas PERSONAGE-RB uses handcrafted parameter settings to convey different personality traits, PERSONAGE-PE relies on parameter estimation models to estimate the
parameter values in Table 2 from target personality scores. At training time, our method
requires the following steps:
Use a base generator to produce multiple utterances by randomly varying
its parameters (see Section 3.1).
Ask human subjects to evaluate (rate) the personality/style of each
utterance.
Train statistical models predicting the parameter values from the
personality ratings (see Section 4.1).
Select the best model for each parameter via cross-validation (see
Section 4.2).
At generation time, the models are used to predict the optimal set of generation parameters given a set of target personality scores, and the base generator is called once
with the predicted parameter values. The architecture for the PE method is shown in
Downloaded from by guest on 26 March 2025
Mairesse and Walker
Trainable Generation of Personality Traits
PERSONAGE-PE’s parameter estimation framework.
In contrast with the overgenerate–score (OS) method discussed in Section 1.1,
parameter estimation models predict generation decisions directly from input personality scores, in the spirit of the approach of Paiva and Evans . However, whereas
Paiva and Evans’ approach searches for the generation decisions that will yield the
optimal target scores according to their model, our PE method does not involve any
search, as generation decisions are assumed to be conditionally independent given the
target personality, and treated as dependent variables in individual models.
This section further details the steps required for training parameter estimation
models. We ﬁrst explain in Section 3.1 how we collect the judge’s ratings for our training
set. Then Section 3.2 analyzes the coverage and naturalness of the collected data. Finally,
Section 3.3 describes how the models are trained.
3.1 Collecting Judgments of Random Sample
In order to train the parameter estimation models, the ﬁrst step is to collect a data
set mapping generation decisions to personality ratings. This involves the following
Generate a sample of random utterances that produces examples covering
the full range of all of the 67 PERSONAGE parameters as shown in Table 2.
Log the generation decisions that were made to produce each utterance.
Judges rate the random sample with a standard personality test shown in
Figure 3, based on Gosling, Rentfrow, and Swann . This results in
each utterance in the sample being labelled with ﬁve scalar values, one for
each of the Big Five traits.
To be the basis for training a high performing statistical generator, the random sample
must satisfy two properties. First, it must cover the full range of scalar values for
each Big Five trait or there will not be enough training data to learn how to produce
utterances manifesting those values. Second, the randomly produced utterances must
be natural enough to produce stable personality judgments. The only way to verify
that the random sample satisﬁes these properties is by ﬁrst generating the random
sample and then analyzing the judge’s ratings. We generated 160 random utterances

to constitute our random sample. Table 3 shows examples of random utterances and
the scalar ratings for each trait that result from the judgment collection process.
A major advantage of the Big Five framework is that it offers standard validated
questionnaires . Figure 3 shows the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI)
that we used to collect the personality judgments ,
adapted to our domain and task. The TIPI produces a scalar rating for each of the
Big Five traits ranging from 1 (e.g., highly neurotic) to 7 (e.g., very stable), and it was
shown to correlate well with longer questionnaires such as the Big Five Inventory, with
convergent correlations of .87, .70, .75, .81, and .65 for extraversion, emotional stability,
agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience, respectively . Although the TIPI has mostly been used as a self-report
measure of personality, it has also been used to assess personality perceptions of
observers, for example, based on short social interactions or social networking Web sites . The
judges in our experiment were researchers and postgraduate students in psychology,
history, and anthropology who were familiar with the Big Five trait theory, but not with
natural language generation. They were all native speakers of English. As illustrated in
Figure 3, the judges were asked to rate each utterance in the random sample using the
TIPI scale. They were instructed to rate the utterance as if it had been uttered by a friend
responding in a dialogue to a request to recommend restaurants. Each judge rated the
same sets of utterances corresponding to 20 communicative goals, 16 utterances per
goal, one set at a time. The order of the sets and the order of the utterances within each
set were both randomized. The judges were asked to read all the utterances in a set

before rating them. Eight utterances out of sixteen were randomly generated for
each communicative goal. The remaining utterances were generated using the
handcrafted parameter settings of PERSONAGE-RB for each end of each Big Five trait
 . The rule-based utterances are used as a comparison point,
not for training the models. The same methodology was used to collect additional
extraversion ratings for another set of 160 random and 80 rule-based utterances in a
separate experiment, resulting in 320 random and 240 rule-based utterances for that
trait, and 160 random utterances and 40 rule-based utterances for each of the other four
traits. Examples of the resulting scalar ratings are shown in Table 3. The judges also
evaluated the naturalness of each utterance on the same scale.
3.2 Generation Range and Naturalness
Analysis of the collected ratings of the random utterances shows that 67.8% of the
utterances were rated as natural (rating above or equal to 4), with an average naturalness rating of 4.38 out of 7. Figure 4 shows the distributions of openness to experience and naturalness ratings. Figure 4a illustrates that most randomly generated
utterances are not perceived as projecting an extreme personality. Table 4 examines
whether randomly generated utterances can hit the extreme ends of each trait scale by
tabulating the most extreme ratings obtained from the 8 random utterances generated
for each communicative goal with the ratings of the rule-based utterance generated
from the same goal. This comparison provides useful information regarding (a) the
potential of data-driven models to outperform handcrafted methods, and (b) whether
our training corpus is large enough to capture the range of behavior we intend to
convey. Paired t-tests over 20 communicative goals show that on average the most
extreme random utterance is signiﬁcantly more extreme for the positive end of the extraversion, emotional stability, and agreeableness scales, and signiﬁcantly more extreme
for both ends of the conscientiousness and openness to experience scales 
is compared with the ratings obtained for rule-based utterances (Rule-based). Ratings are

tailed). However, random utterances are not perceived as introverted as those generated
using the introvert parameter settings (see Rule-based/Low column for extraversion).
Compare the distributions of judgments for the rule-based extraversion utterances with
the judgments on the random sample shown in Figure 5. Nevertheless, these results
suggest that randomizing PERSONAGE’s parameters produces a wide range of variation
with an utterance sample of less than 10 utterances, for any communicative goal.
The bottom row of Table 4 also compares the naturalness of the random utterances with the naturalness of the rule-based utterances produced by PERSONAGE-RB

are less natural than the rule-based utterances, and this difference is close to signiﬁcance
(p = .075, two-tailed t-test).
It is also important to quantify the quality of the annotations by evaluating the interrater agreement between the judges. Table 5 shows that the judges agree signiﬁcantly
on the ratings of random utterances for all Big Five traits (p < .05, two-tailed), with
correlations ranging from .26 (conscientiousness) to .40 (agreeableness), which are high
correlations for human perceptual judgments. However the agreement is lower than
on the rule-based utterances. A possible explanation of both the naturalness differences
and rater agreement is that the random generation decisions sometimes produce utterances with inconsistent personality cues, which can be interpreted in different ways
by the judges. For example, the utterance ‘Err... I am sure you would like Chanpen Thai!’
expresses markers of both introversion (ﬁlled pause) and extraversion (exclamation
3.3 Training Parameter Estimation Models
Parameter estimation requires a series of pre-processing steps, in order to ensure that
the models’ output is re-usable by the PERSONAGE base generator. The initial data set
includes the random sample annotated with the generation decision features shown
in Table 2, together with the average judges’ ratings along each Big Five dimension,
as described in Section 3.1. The following transformations are performed before the
learning phase:
Reverse input and output: As parameter estimation models map from
personality scores to generation parameters, the generation decisions are
set as the data set’s output variables and the averaged personality ratings
as the input features.
Predict parameters individually: A new data set is created for each output
variable (i.e., generation parameter) as the statistical models we use only
predict one output. We thus make the simplifying assumption that
PERSONAGE’s generation parameters are independent.1
Map output variables into PERSONAGE’s input space: The generation
decisions made when generating each utterance in the random sample
were recorded. In order to ensure that the parameter estimation models’
1 Although this assumption is violated by the internal constraints of PERSONAGE’s generation process,
Section 4.3 investigates the extent to which this violation affects the models’ accuracy.

Trainable Generation of Personality Traits
output is re-usable by the base generator, the generation decision space
is mapped to PERSONAGE’s input parameter space. The conversion is
dependent on the type of generation parameter:
Continuous parameters: Generation decision values are normalized over
all random utterances, resulting in values between 0 and 1. For example,
a VERBOSITY parameter value of 1 indicates the utterance with the largest
number of propositions in the utterance set.
Aggregation operation probabilities: Frequency counts of aggregation
operations realizing a speciﬁc rhetorical relation are divided by the
number of occurrences of the rhetorical relation in the utterance. This
ratio is the maximum likelihood estimate of the conditional probability
of the aggregation operation given the rhetorical relation. For example,
if out of four INFER relations in the utterance, only one is realized using
the MERGE operation, the value for the INFER - MERGE parameter is
.25 for that utterance.
Binary parameters: No processing is required as generation decisions are
already boolean. For example, if an exclamation mark was inserted in the
utterance, the EXCLAMATION parameter value is set to 1 rather than 0.
Feature selection: Personality traits that do not correlate with a generation
parameter with a Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient above .1 are removed
from that parameter’s data set. This has the effect of removing parameters
that do not correlate strongly with any trait, which are set to a constant
default value at generation time.
Once the data is partitioned into data sets mapping the relevant personality dimensions
(the features) to each generation parameter (the dependent variable), it can be used to
train parameter estimation models predicting the most appropriate parameter value
given target personality scores. Parameters are estimated using either regression or
classiﬁcation models, depending on whether they are continuous (e.g., VERBOSITY) or
binary (e.g., EXCLAMATION). Recall that Table 2 indicated for each parameter whether it
is continous (C) or binary (B). In order to identify what model should be used for each
parameter, we compare various learning algorithms using the Weka toolbox .
Continuous parameters in Table 2 are modeled with a linear regression model
(LR), an M5’ model tree (M5), and a model based on support vector machines with a
linear kernel (SVM). As regression models can extrapolate beyond the interval, the
output parameter values are truncated if needed—at generation time—before being sent
to the base generator. Regression models are evaluated using the correlation between
the model’s predictions and the actual parameter values in the test data.
Binary parameters in Table 2 are modeled using classiﬁers that predict whether the
parameter should be enabled or disabled. We test a Naive Bayes classiﬁer (NB), a C4.5
decision tree (J48), a nearest-neighbor classiﬁer using one neighbor (NN), the Ripper
rule-based learner (JRIP), the AdaBoost boosting algorithm (ADA), and a support vector
machines classiﬁer with a linear kernel (SVM). Unless speciﬁed, the learning algorithms
use Weka’s default parameter values.

10-fold cross-validation in Section 4.2. Finally, Section 4.3 evaluates human perceptions
of utterances generated using the models.
4.1 Qualitative Model Evaluation
Before discussing our quantitative results, we use Figures 6, 7, and 8 to illustrate how
the learned models predict generation parameters from input personality scores. Note
that sometimes the best performing model is non-linear. For example, given input trait
values, the AdaBoost model in Figure 6 outputs the class yielding the largest sum of
weights for the rules returning that class. The ﬁrst rule of the EXCLAMATION model in
Figure 6 shows that an extraversion score above 6.42 out of 7 would increase the weight
of the enabled class by 1.81. The ﬁfth rule indicates that a target agreeableness above
5.13 would further increase the weight by .42. Figure 6 also illustrates how personality
traits that do not have an effect on the parameter are removed, i.e., extraversion and
agreeableness are the traits that affect the use of exclamation marks. The STUTTERING
model tree in Figure 7 lets us calculate that a low emotional stability (1.0) together with a
neutral conscientiousness (4.0) and openness to experience (4.0) yield a parameter value
of .62 (see bottom-left linear model), whereas a neutral emotional stability decreases the
value down to .17. The full parameter range obtained when varying both emotional
stability and conscientiousness is illustrated in Figure 9, which shows that the .5 cut-off

point can be reached for low emotional stability scores and mid-range conscientiousness
scores. The linear model in Figure 8 shows that agreeableness has a strong effect on the
CONTENT POLARITY parameter (.97 weight), but emotional stability, conscientiousness,
and openness to experience also inﬂuence the parameter value.
Inspection of the learned models provides interesting information about whether
ﬁndings in the psychology literature carry over to our domain. However, in order to
optimize the overall generation performance, we rely on a quantitative analysis for
selecting individual models.
4.2 Cross-Validation on Corpus of Expert Judgments
We identify the best performing model(s) for each generation parameter via a 10-fold
cross-validation. For continuous parameters, Table 6 evaluates modeling accuracy by
comparing the correlations between the model’s predictions and the actual parameter
values in the test folds. Table 7 reports results for binary parameter classiﬁers, by
comparing the F-measures of the enabled class. The F-measure measures how well the
models predict the enabled class given the small proportion of instances labelled as

the extent to which their parameter will affect the trained system.

in Figure 7 produces a correlation of .23. Concerning binary parameters, although
differences between the best performing models are not signiﬁcant, Table 7 suggests
that the Naive Bayes classiﬁer is generally the most accurate, with F-measures of .40 for
the IN-GROUP MARKER parameter, and .32 for both the insertion of ﬁlled pauses (err)
and tag questions. The results suggest that the AdaBoost learning algorithm performs
best for predicting the EXCLAMATION parameter, with an F-measure of .38 for the model
in Figure 6.
These results show that there are large variations between model performance for a
given parameter (e.g., CONCESSION POLARITY). This suggests that exploring different
learning algorithms for individual parameters is beneﬁcial. While the overall modeling
accuracy can seem relatively low—for example, there are only four parameters with
correlations above r = .25 in Table 6—it is important to keep in mind that the utterances
were randomly generated, hence the effect of a speciﬁc parameter is likely to be affected
by other random parameter values. The next section therefore evaluates whether the
models are good enough to produce reliable effects on user perceptions.
4.3 Evaluation with Naive Subjects
The evaluation presented in Section 4.2 measures how well the PE models predict the
parameters, using parameter settings in the random sample and expert judge ratings
as the predictors. We relied on a small number of expert judges to minimize rating
inconsistencies and facilitate the learning process. In order to test whether the PE
method produces high quality outputs manifesting personality, we ran an experiment
with 24 native English speakers (12 male and 12 female graduate students from a range
of disciplines from both the U.K. and the U.S.). We produced a set of 50 utterances
for this experiment using the best performing models for each generation parameter
shown in Tables 6 and 7. Given this model, we generate 5 utterances for each of 10 input
communicative goals. Each utterance targets an extreme value for two traits (either 1
or 7 out of 7) and neutral values for the remaining three traits (4 out of 7). The goal is
for each utterance to project multiple traits on a continuous scale. Here, we test whether

PE models can convey personality in extreme regions of the Big Five space. In order to
generate a range of alternatives for each input communicative goal, all target scores are
randomized around their initial value according to a normal probability distribution
with a standard deviation of 10% of the full scale (see Figure 10).
All 50 utterances were evaluated by the 24 naive subjects using the TIPI in Figure 3
 . As in the training data collection (Section 3.1),
the subjects rated one set of ﬁve utterances at a time, one for each communicative
goal. The communicative goals and the utterances were presented in random order.
To limit the experiment’s duration, only the two traits with extreme target values are
evaluated for each utterance. As a result, 20 utterances are evaluated for each trait, 10
of which were generated to convey the low end of that trait, and 10 of which target the
high end of that trait. Each utterance was also evaluated for its naturalness as before.
Subjects thus answered 5 questions for 50 utterances, two from the TIPI for each extreme
trait and one about naturalness (250 judgments in total per subject). Subjects were not
told that the utterances were intended to manifest extreme trait values.
Table 8 shows several sample outputs and the mean personality ratings from the
naive subjects for two communicative goals. For example, utterance 1.a projects a
high extraversion through the insertion of an exclamation mark based on the model
in Figure 6, whereas utterance 2.a conveys introversion by beginning with the ﬁlled
pause err. The same utterance also projects a low agreeableness by focusing on negative
propositions, through a low CONTENT POLARITY parameter value produced by the
model in Figure 8.
4.3.1 Naturalness and Inter-Rater Agreement. Figure 11 shows the distribution of the naturalness ratings. A Shapiro-Wilk test conﬁrms that the ratings are normally distributed
(W = .97, p = .31), with only one utterance out of 50 rated below 2.5 out of 7 on average.
The average naturalness is 3.98 out of 7, with a rating of 4 indicating neither agreement
nor disagreement. This is lower than the naturalness scores obtained in Section 3.2
for the random training utterances collected using a small number of expert judges.

The differences in naturalness judgments could possibly be due to (a) the different set
of judges; (b) the fact that utterances conveying extreme personality are likely to be
perceived as less natural; or (c) the fact that the expert judges made a very large number
of judgments, and thus became accustomed to judging the outputs.
Table 9 reports the inter-rater correlation over all personality ratings, averaged over
the 276 pairs of judges. The level of agreement between the naive subjects reﬂects
the difﬁculty of the personality recognition task for humans, thus providing an upper
bound on the performance to be expected from a model trained on human data. The

judges agree modestly, with correlations ranging from .17 (openness to experience) to
.41 (emotional stability). This agreement is lower than that for rule-based utterances,
which could be due to the nature of the personality cues conveyed by PERSONAGE-
RB’s handcrafted parameters. However, this difference could also result from the use of
naive judges, which we believe are less consistent in their personality judgments.
4.3.2 Modeling Accuracy. Modeling accuracy is measured using both the correlation and
mean absolute error (on a scale from 1 to 7) between the target personality scores and the
judges’ ratings. Given the relatively small number of distinct utterances being evaluated
(20 per trait), it is important to take the non-determinism of PERSONAGE into account
when evaluating the correlation between the target scores and the judges’ ratings. Evaluating correlations over the 480 ratings of each judge and utterance pair is likely to result
in an inﬂated signiﬁcance level, as it does not account for the possibility that a speciﬁc
outcome of PERSONAGE’s random generation decisions could produce the intended
personality, rather than accurate personality modeling. In order to address this issue,
we report correlations ravg between the target personality scores and the 20 personality
ratings averaged over all 24 judges (i.e., the reported signiﬁcance levels do take the
number of distinct test utterances into account). Table 10 shows that extraversion is the
dimension modeled the most accurately by the parameter estimation models, produc-

ing a .80 correlation between the target extraversion and the average subjects’ ratings
(p < .001). Emotional stability and agreeableness ratings also correlate strongly with
the target scores, with correlations of .64 and .68, respectively (p < .005 and p < .001).
The correlation for openness to experience is also relatively strong (.41), although it is
not signiﬁcant at the p < .05 level (p = .07). These correlations are unexpectedly high;
in corpus analyses, signiﬁcant correlations as low as .05 to .15 are typically observed
between averaged personality ratings and linguistic markers . Although each utterance is used to test
two hypotheses (i.e., rated for two traits), results for extraversion, emotional stability,
and agreeableness remain largely signiﬁcant even after applying Bonferroni correction
(p < .001, p < .005, and p < .005 respectively).
Conscientiousness is the only dimension whose ratings do not correlate with the
target scores. The comparison with rule-based results in Table 11 suggests that this is
not because conscientiousness cannot be exhibited in our domain or manifested in a
single utterance, so perhaps this arises from differing perceptions of conscientiousness
between the expert and naive judges. It is also possible that inconsistencies in the
training data prevented the models from learning accurate cues for conscientiousness,
as Table 5 shows that the judges disagreed the most over that trait when rating the
training utterances.
Table 10 shows that the mean absolute error varies between 1.89 and 2.79 on a scale
from 1 to 7. Such large errors result from the decision to ask judges to answer just the
TIPI questions for the two traits that were the extreme targets, because the judges tend

to use the whole scale, with normally distributed ratings (Shapiro-Wilk tests, p > .05).
This means that although the judges make distinctions leading to high correlations,
the averaged ratings result in a compressed scale. This explains the large correlations
despite the magnitude of the absolute error.
It is important to emphasize that generation parameter values were predicted based
on ﬁve target personality scores. Thus, the results show that individual traits are perceived even when utterances project other traits as well, as would be expected according
to the Big Five theory.
Table 11 compares the mean ratings of the utterances generated by PERSONAGE-PE
with ratings of 20 utterances generated with the rule-based parameter settings for each
extreme of each Big Five trait (40 for extraversion, resulting in 240 rule-based utterances
in total). Although rating differences could be due to the different set of judges, Table 11
suggests that the handcrafted parameter settings project a more extreme personality for
6 traits out of 10. However, the parameter estimation models are not signiﬁcantly worse
than the rule-based generator for neuroticism, disagreeableness, unconscientiousness,
and openness to experience. Moreover, the differences between low and high average
ratings for the parameter models shown in the right-hand-side of Table 11 are signiﬁcant
for all traits but conscientiousness (p ≤.001). Thus parameter estimation models can be
used in applications that only require discrete binary variation.
Additionally, we evaluate whether the naive subjects perceive the small differences
within each group of extreme utterances. At the beginning of this section, we mentioned
that the target scores used in the evaluation experiment were randomized according to a
normal distribution around 1 or 7, with a standard deviation of 10% of the full scale (.60).
Figure 10 shows the distribution of the target scores for emotional stability. We compute
the correlation between the target scores and the average judges’ ratings over each
group of extreme target scores.2 Table 12 shows that the naive subjects failed to detect
the small variation within each group, although results are close to signiﬁcance for the
positive end of the emotional stability scale, with a correlation of .55 for the emotionally
stable group (p = .08). This suggests that parameter estimation models could model
that trait with a high granularity given more training samples, as all that is needed is
for our models to learn to trigger relevant personality markers within extreme regions
of the stylistic space. For example, Figure 9 shows that the STUTTERING parameter value

parameter becomes enabled (i.e., above .5) for emotional stability scores below 1.81 (see
middle leaf node in Figure 7).
The low correlation observed for other traits (e.g., extraversion) shows that the
high accuracy reported in Table 10 is due to the successful modeling of large variations
between each end of the scale, rather than the small-scale variations within one side of
the dimension. Although these results are promising, future work should evaluate the
granularity of parameter estimation models over the full range of the Big Five scales.
5. Discussion
This article presents a novel SNLG method based on parameter estimation models that
estimate optimal generation parameters given target stylistic scores, which are then
used directly by the base generator to produce the output utterance. We believe that
dialogue applications such as spoken dialogue systems, interactive drama systems, and
intelligent tutoring systems would beneﬁt from taking individual stylistic differences
into account, and that theories of human personality traits represent an appropriate set
of dimensions for a computational model of this adaptation. Starting from a communicative goal, we show how personality affects all phases of the language generation
process, and that certain parameters such as the polarity of the content selected have
a strong effect on the perception of personality. We present, to our knowledge, the
ﬁrst results of a human evaluation experiment using the perceptions of naive subjects
to evaluate the stylistic variation of a language generator. The parameter estimation
method is a computationally tractable generation method that does not require any
overgeneration phase, and our results show that naive judges can recognize the intended system personality for most traits.
Whereas most previous work on SNLG is based on the overgenerate and scoring
(OS) framework , our results show that direct parameter optimization
is a viable alternative for stylistic control. Given the cost of an overgeneration phase,
parameter estimation methods might be the only alternative for real-time generation,
which is necessary for spoken dialogue interaction. The fact that the accuracy of OS
methods depends on the complexity of the overgeneration phase prevents them from
scaling to the large generation space required for stylistic variation. For example, an exhaustive search over PERSONAGE’s output space would require more than 267 parameter combinations, for each of which an utterance would have to be generated and scored.
On the other hand, the tractability of OS methods could be improved by pruning candidates throughout the generation process, as well as by using compact data
structures—such as in the OpenCCG chart realizer —although we do not know of any SNLG system using this approach. The main
advantage of the OS approach is that it can model global utterance features reﬂecting
multiple generation decisions as well as input dependencies (e.g., sentence length). The
predictive accuracy of scoring models trained on our data discussed in the introduction
suggests that OS methods could be useful for stylistic SNLG when limited to a mild
data-driven overgeneration phase, e.g., to rerank candidate utterances produced by
stochastic parameter estimation models. The OS approach therefore can be seen as a
way to relax the parameter independence assumptions required to learn robust models.
Parameter estimation models are trained on utterances generated in the application
domain. In contrast with out-of-domain corpus based methods , in-domain personality annotations not only reduce data sparsity by
constraining the range of outputs, they also allow us to explicitly model the relation
between stylistic factors and generation decisions. The parameter estimation approach
is inspired by previous work by Paiva and Evans , who present a data-driven
method for stylistic control that does not require an overgeneration phase. We extend
this work in multiple ways. First, we focus on the control of the speaker’s personality,
rather than stylistic dimensions extracted from corpora. Second, we present a method
for learning parameter estimation models predicting generation decisions directly from
input personality scores, whereas the method of Paiva and Evans requires a
search for the optimal generation decision over the model’s input space. Third, we
present a perceptual evaluation of the generated stylistic variation, using naive human
We modeled stylistic variation in terms of the Big Five personality traits, because
these traits are widely accepted as the most important dimensions of behavioral variation within human beings . Collecting reliable personality annotations for in-domain utterances is a non-trivial task, as reﬂected by the
moderate inter-rater agreement reported in Section 4.3.1. The difﬁculty is increased by
the use of random generation decisions, which is necessary to ensure that the learned
relation between personality ratings and generation parameters is not due to artiﬁcial
correlations between generation decisions. One way to increase inter-rater agreement
would be to reduce the number of parameters varied simultaneously for each utterance,
thereby decreasing the chances of observing inconsistent markers. While this would
require collecting a larger training set to model the same number of parameters, one
could ﬁlter out irrelevant parameters in a ﬁrst data collection phase, to focus on data
quality in a second phase. A second way to improve the quality of the annotations
would be to increase the size of each text sample, by simultaneously rating multiple
utterances generated from the same parameters, rather than a single utterance. This is
likely to produce models that are more robust to input variation, given a small increase
in annotation effort. Despite the difﬁculty of the annotation task, our experiments show
that parameter estimation models are able to detect a large range of personality markers
in our training set. The fact that those markers are successfully recognized by naive
judges suggests that our approach is robust to ambiguities in the data.
While the Big Five traits are widely accepted in the psychology literature, they
differ in terms of their impact on linguistic production. Results suggest that perceptions
of agreeableness and extraversion are easier to model, whereas conscientiousness and
openness to experience are more difﬁcult. A possible explanation is that these traits
are not conveyed well in PERSONAGE’s narrow domain. However, previous personality
recognition results suggest that observed openness to experience is difﬁcult to model
using general conversational data as well . It is therefore possible
that this trait may not be expressed through spoken language as clearly as other traits.
The evaluation using naive judges in Table 10 shows that the average ratings
correlate strongly with the target personality scores for all traits but conscientiousness,
with correlation coefﬁcients ranging from .41 (openness to experience) up to .80
(extraversion). It is important to note that the magnitudes of the model correlations are
high compared to traditional correlations between personality and linguistic markers,
which typically range from .05 to .10 . This is possibly due to our experimental method, which
simultaneously tests a small number of personality markers in a controlled experiment,
whereas such markers are harder to extract from the varied language samples used in
psychology studies.

Trainable Generation of Personality Traits
In terms of limitations, even though PERSONAGE’s parameters were suggested by
psychological studies, some of them are not modeled successfully by the parameter estimation approach, and thus were omitted from Tables 6 and 7. This could be due to the
relatively small training set size (160 utterances to optimize 67 parameters). However,
even with a larger training set, it is possible that some of the parameters in Table 2 are
not perceivable in our domain. Additionally, the parameter-independence assumption
of the PE method could be responsible for the poor accuracy of some models. While
this issue could possibly be resolved by training statistical models that simultaneously
predict multiple dependent variables (e.g., structured prediction methods), this would
exponentially increase the size of the parameter prediction space and further aggravate
data sparsity issues.
We also ﬁnd that parameter estimation models perform slightly worse when projecting extreme traits than the rule-based generator in the same domain (see Section 4.3.2). We believe this is due to the lack of extreme utterances in the training data to
learn from. Future work should consider whether it is possible to ﬂatten the distribution
of training data, perhaps using more knowledge or active learning methods for NLG
 .
Another limitation of the current approach is that we assume the existence of
a generation dictionary containing syntactic templates that, in some cases, express
various pragmatic effects, even though most of PERSONAGE’s variation is generated
automatically. Our dictionary is currently handcrafted, but future work could build on
research on methods for extracting the generation dictionary from data .
Finally, it is likely that both the accuracy and coverage of parameter estimation
models could be improved with a larger sample of judges and random utterances at
development time. A larger number of judges would also smooth out rating inconsistencies and individual differences in personality perception, thus allowing the direct
modeling of laypeople’s perceptions by removing the need for expert judges.
Another important area for future work is to explore the interface between the
language generator and the dialogue manager and text-to-speech (TTS) engine, because
personality also affects aspects of dialogue such as initiative and prosodic realization
 . It might be possible to apply a similar methodology to the parameterization of a dialogue manager and a TTS component, in order to
project a consistent personality to the user, or to use a reinforcement learning approach
to train the dialogue manager ,
with personality judgments as the objective function. Our results suggest that personality can be recognized by manipulating the linguistic cues of a single utterance, but it
is likely that additional cues (e.g., characterizing the system’s dialogue strategy) could
only make the user’s perception of the system’s personality more robust.
Nevertheless it is clear that the PE SNLG approach offers many advantages over
handcrafted methods. Firstly, SNLG methods can scale more easily to other domains
and other types of stylistic variation, as collecting data requires less effort than tuning
a large number parameters. In order to apply our method to a new domain or task, the
base generator would have to be modiﬁed. Although PERSONAGE was implemented
with domain independence in mind by using general parameters, handling a new communicative goal (e.g., a user request) would require modifying the syntactic aggregation
operations as well as the pragmatic marker insertion rules. Porting PERSONAGE to
a new information presentation domain would only require modifying the syntactic
templates in the generation dictionary. Once a base generator is available in the target
domain, it can be used to collect ratings for any stylistic dimension. Our parameter

estimation method can then learn to control the generator’s output from data, without
any further handcrafting or parameter tuning. A second advantage of our parameter
estimation method over handcrafted approaches is that it can learn to target scalar
combinations of the Big Five traits, whereas handcrafting all possible ways in which
multiple stylistic dimensions can affect output utterances requires considerable effort.
Thirdly, our parameter estimation method can easily model continuous stylistic dimensions, while producing such models by hand is not tractable. For example, one could
interpolate various handcrafted parameter sets to handle continuous input scales (e.g.,
to generate an utterance that is 75% extravert); however, the various weights can only
be learned reliably from data.
Our results also suggest that SNLG systems may still require handcrafting to guarantee the naturalness of the output, but that data-driven models can be used to control
various pragmatic effects. As naturalness depends on the combination of multiple
generation decisions, modeling naturalness in the PE framework would require taking
inter-parameter dependencies into account. At training time, this can be achieved by
extending each PE model with independent variables for naturalness as well as all
previous generation decisions made. During the generation process, the models would
predict future generation decisions given all previous decisions and a high input naturalness value. Although we believe this approach is tractable, it optimizes parameters
sequentially in a greedy fashion. A global optimization method would require jointly
optimizing all (past and future) parameters simultaneously. However, predictions in
such a large output space would require a much larger training set. Nevertheless, we
believe that future work should evaluate methods for jointly optimizing multiple NLG
decisions.
Finally, this work focuses on controlling the perceptions of the output of a dialogue
system, but an important next step is to use these techniques together with personalitybased user modeling methods to simultaneously model the
personality of the user and the system in dialogue. Both models provide the tools
for testing various hypotheses regarding personality-based alignment, such as the
similarity–attraction effect . Furthermore,
the optimal personality of the system is likely to be application-dependent; it would
thus be useful to evaluate how the user’s and the system’s personality affect task
performance in different applications.
