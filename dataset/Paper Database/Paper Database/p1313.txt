INTRODUCTION
Although 5-year survival rate of breast cancer is relatively
high, the recurrence rate of it is also high (about 20% to 30%,
depending on stage) . One of the major challenges in breast
cancer management is to classify patients into correct risk
groups, for better treatment and follow-up planning. Appropriate risk assessment is critically important, not only to avoid
breast cancer recurrence, but also to optimize patient’s health
and the use of medical resources. A variety of prediction models
for breast cancer prognosis have been developed and utilized.
These can be categorized as international treatment guidelines,
gene expression profiles and computer-based risk calculators
 . However all of these approaches have their own strength
and weakness.
International treatment guidelines, including St. Gallen
guidelines, were prepared by the clinical expert panels. Since
1978, the St. Gallen international expert consensus proposed
St. Gallen guidelines for the selection of the optimal adjuvant
systemic treatments for each specific patient group . By
the guideline, adjuvant chemotherapy is the recommended
treatment for patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer.
In spite of its simplicity to be applied in clinical setting, ethnic
differences have been noted in the prognosis of lymph nodenegative breast cancer. Iwamoto et al. demonstrated that

Purpose: The prediction of breast cancer recurrence is a crucial
factor for successful treatment and follow-up planning. The principal
objective of this study was to construct a novel prognostic model
based on support vector machine (SVM) for the prediction of
breast cancer recurrence within 5 years after breast cancer
surgery in the Korean population, and to compare the predictive
performance of the model with the previously established models.
Methods: Data on 679 patients, who underwent breast cancer
surgery between 1994 and 2002, were collected retrospectively
from a Korean tertiary teaching hospital. The following variables
were selected as independent variables for the prognostic model,
by using the established medical knowledge and univariate
analysis: histological grade, tumor size, number of metastatic
lymph node, estrogen receptor, lymphovascular invasion, local
invasion of tumor, and number of tumors. Three prediction
algorithms, with each using SVM, artificial neural network and
Cox-proportional hazard regression model, were constructed
and compared with one another. The resultant and most effective
model based on SVM was compared with previously established
prognostic models, which included Adjuvant! Online, Nottingham
prognostic index (NPI), and St. Gallen guidelines. Results: The
SVM-based prediction model, named ‘breast cancer recurrence
prediction based on SVM (BCRSVM),’ proposed herein outperformed other prognostic models (area under the curve=0.85,
0.71, 0.70, respectively for the BCRSVM, Adjuvant! Online, and
NPI). The BCRSVM evidenced substantially high sensitivity (0.89),
specificity (0.73), positive predictive values (0.75), and negative
predictive values (0.89). Conclusion: As the selected prognostic
factors can be easily obtained in clinical practice, the proposed
model might prove useful in the prediction of breast cancer
recurrence. The prediction model is freely available in the website (

Recurrence Prediction Model for Breast Cancer
 
 
the prognoses of patients with lymph node-negative breast
cancer in Japan tended to be more positive than those of their
Western counterparts. Thus, they concluded that the use of St.
Gallen guidelines may result in overtreatment .
Microarray technology is increasingly contributing to our
understanding of cancer biology, specifically via the study of
gene expression. Gene expression profiles, including Oncotype
DX (Genomic Health Inc., Redwood City, USA) and Mamma-
Print (Agendia, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) allow for a
more quantitative and rationalized approach to individualized
breast cancer treatments, by identifying gene activity patterns.
MammaPrint is a commercial gene-expression diagnostic test
that employs a 70-gene prognostic signature to classify the
recurrence of breast cancer, as low-risk or high-risk .
However, MammaPrint is rather expensive, and is constrained
to women with age 61 years or younger with primary invasive
breast cancer of tumor size <5 cm, stage 1 or 2, and up to 3
positive lymph nodes. Both Oncotype DX and MammaPrint
are also limited in that they assign almost all estrogen receptor
(ER)-negative patients into high-risk group .
The Nottingham prognostic index (NPI) and Adjuvant!
Online are computer-based models used for the prognosis of
breast cancer recurrence . The NPI is based on multivariate analysis, and has been employed broadly in clinical
practice. However, the NPI employs only three prognostic
factors (tumor size, tumor grade, and lymph node status) .
Adjuvant! Online is a web-based software application that
calculates patients’ 10-year survival probability, which is based
on the patient’s age, tumor size, grade, ER status, and nodal
status .
The regression analysis is one of the most widely used multivariate analysis method, assuming linear relationships between
the independent and dependent variables. However, it has been
demonstrated that much of biomedical variables are non-linear
in nature. Thus, regression method cannot be readily adapted
to non-linear problems . The support vector machine
(SVM) method was recently suggested by Cortes and Vapnik
 . It has been well established that SVM evidences superior
prediction performance in both linear and non-linear problems
 . The SVM is a firmly established data mining algorithm,
which is widely used in a variety of fields, not only in the
biomedical area, but also in the fields of engineering .
Despite its superior prediction performance, the SVM is relatively unfamiliar to the prognostic model field for cancer. Brief
descript of SVM is provided in the methods section. However,
detailed description of it is quite complex and requires long
lists of sequential equations and notations, which are quite
beyond the scope of this journal.
The aims of this study were to develop a novel prognostic
model, which is based on SVM named ‘breast cancer recurrence prediction based on SVM (BCRSVM)’ for the prediction
of Korean breast cancer recurrence within 5 years after breast
cancer surgery, and to compare the predictive performance of
the model with the previously established models, including
Adjuvant! Online, NPI, and St. Gallen guidelines. We also
identified relevant prognostic factors in breast cancer patients
after surgical interventions, and calculated the importance of
the prognostic factors by normalized mutual information .
Study population
This study used a longitudinal observation data of 733
patients, whose information was maintained in a breast cancer center of a Korean tertiary teaching hospital. A subset of
808 patients, out of the total 1,541 diagnosed, was excluded
in the study group because there was no clinical data in the
research registry, as a result of unidentified and/or incomplete
follow-up. Identifiable personal data of the patients were
removed from the data before analysis. The protocol of this
study were reviewed and approved by the Ajou University
Hospital Institutional Review Board (AJIRB-MED-MDB-10-
226). These data were relevant to the cohorts of breast cancer
patients, who underwent breast cancer surgery, between July
1994 and April 2002, with a follow-up period of at least 60
months, and a median follow-up period of 86 months. The
disease-free survival was 79.9% at the 5 years follow-up from
the surgery. The mean disease-free survival was 93.3±1.6
months for patients who developed recurrent breast cancer.
Recurrent breast cancer includes any of ipsilateral breast tumor
recurrence, contralateral breast tumor recurrence, regional
lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. Of the 733 study
population, 54 subjects were excluded from the study participants, through the following exclusion criteria: male patients
(11), with other multiple cancers (14), stage IV cancer (7), and
unidentified follow-up time (22). Thus the resulting 679 subjects with invasive breast cancer were included in the study
population (Figure 1).
Prognosis factor selection
Previously established clinical knowledge and univariate
analyses were used to select relevant variables for independent
variables to the prediction model. Of the 193 available variables
in the data set, which were composed of administrative, epidemiologic, clinical and pathologic data, 38 clinically relevant
variables were preliminarily selected by one of the authors.
Through second-rounds of consensus meeting between the
authors including physician, surgical pathologist and breast
Woojae Kim, et al.
 
 
surgeon, 14 variables were selected. Although the use of established clinical knowledge is one of the most representative
methods for preliminary screening of independent variable
selection, however, this would introduce a significant bias in
the selection process. Therefore, as a final stage of variable selection, univariate analyses based on Kaplan-Meier analysis for
categorical variables and univariate Cox regression for continuous variables were applied. Resulting statistically significant
(p-value <0.05) variables included histological grade, local
invasion of tumor, number of tumors, tumor size, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), ER status, and the number of metastatic
lymph. ‘Local invasion of tumor’ was defined as not only
immovability of tumor at palpation, due to chest wall fixation
through pathological direct tumor invasion, but also radiologically suspicious invasion to pectoralis muscle or skin. LVI
was defined as the unequivocal presence of tumor cells within
any of endothelial-lined space in the breast tissue around the
invasive carcinoma. All of the 7 variables were employed to
the construction of the prediction model.
Selection of data mining algorithm
Although many data mining algorithms have been developed,
this study entailed a comparison of the SVM, artificial neural
network (ANN), and traditional Cox-proportional hazard regression model (Cox regression). The primary purpose of the
SVM is to minimize the upper boundary of the generalization
error by maximizing the margin by the decision boundary,
called the hyperplane, which separates the subjects of one class
(or group) from another, and by minimizing the empirical
classification error by taking into consideration the inherent
complexity of the model. The SVM employs a non-linear
mapping to transform the original training data into higherdimensional data and searches for the linear optimal separating
hyperplane within this new dimension. With appropriate
non-linear mapping to a sufficiently high dimension, a decision
boundary can separate data into two classes (Figure 2). The
SVM finds this decision boundary using support vectors and
margins. In this study, the goal of SVM modeling is to classify
patients who have high risk of breast cancer recurrence. The
result of this classification shows recurrence probability of
breast cancer within 5 years after breast cancer surgery. The
ANN is a traditional data mining algorithm, and is employed
extensively in a variety of clinical areas . Usually SVM or
ANN does not consider time-to-event. However, several
approaches have been proposed to analyze data with time-toevent. The present study used single time-point approach for
the output prediction of breast cancer recurrence within 5
years after the breast cancer surgery. This approach can be used
to produce the estimates of outcome at a specific time of followup. The status (dependent) variable has either recurrent or
non-recurrent within 5 years of follow-up. The Cox regression
is a standard statistical model that reveals the relationships
between different prognostic factors and patient survival on
the basis of time-to-event. All of the selected 7 variables were
entered into the Cox regression model. Clementine 12 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, USA) was employed for model construction

and comparison.
Previously established recurrence prediction models
To compare the performance of the proposed models, 3 previously well-known prediction or classification models were
selected: St. Gallen guidelines, NPI, and Adjuvant! Online.
The International Consensus Panel, which was developed
during the 2009 St. Gallen Conference, defines low clinical-risk
factors, as node-negative, positive ER and positive progesterone
receptors (PR), histological grade 1, low proliferation, no
peritumoral vascular invasion, and tumor size of ≤2 cm .
Because PR, proliferation and peritumoral vascular invasion
were unavailable in our data set, the 4 available factors were
considered in this study.
The NPI is a prognostic model based on tumor size, histological grade, and lymph node status. The NPI point calculation
equation is as follows: tumor size (cm)×0.2+histological
grade+lymph node point (negative nodes=1; 1-3 positive
nodes=2; ≥4 positive nodes=3). The patients were divided,
according to NPI points, into the low-risk (NPI point <3.4)
and high-risk groups (NPI point ≥3.4) .
Adjuvant! Online is a computer-based prognostic model
that can be used to estimate the risk of breast cancer recurrence
and death. Patients were divided into a low-risk (recurrence
probability <30%) and a high-risk group (recurrence probability ≥30%), using Adjuvant! Online for comparison with other
prognostic models.
Prediction model validation and comparison
The holdout method was employed to reduce overfitting in
the model and to derive a reliable estimate of the performance
of the model. The holdout method randomly splits the entire
data sample into two mutually exclusive training set (70%)
and testing set (30%). The training set was utilized to generate
the prediction model and the remaining 30% of the data
(testing set) was employed to estimate the model’s accuracy.
The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
(PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), area under the curve
(AUC), and Kaplan-Meier analysis of each of the models were
calculated for performance comparison between the proposed
BCRSVM, Adjuvant! Online, NPI, and St. Gallen.
Estimation of prognostic factor importance by normalized
mutual information index
The normalized mutual information index (NMI), which is
based on mutual importance, in addition to its role in calculating
the correlation coefficient, is also used to determine the importance of an explanatory prognostic factor for the prediction of
recurrence . Mutual information is a quantitative
measure for the mutual dependence of the variables. In the
biomedical field, it is also employed to find functional genomics
clusters in the RNA expression data . We computed the
entropy of the prediction results of breast cancer recurrence
and the mutual information between prognostic factor patterns
for prediction results, after which, the calculated mutual
information was normalized. The expected fraction of uncertainty reduction, due to prognostic factors, is the NMI. This
NMI ranges between 0 and 100%. If the NMI approaches to
100%, then the 2 variables are profoundly related in some
form, either linearly or nonlinearly.
Statistical analysis
Disease-free survival (DFS) curves were estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method, and were compared using the log-rank
test. The p-values of all statistical tests were two-tailed, and pvalues equal to or less than 0.05 were employed to evaluate
statistical significance. SPSS version 18.0 software (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, USA) and R package were used for all statistical analyses.
The clinicopathologic findings of the study participants are
listed in Table 1. The mean age was 46.5±11.5. The mean
tumor size and number of tumors were 3.22±2.50 cm and
1.07±0.51 cm, respectively. There was a total of 197 of the 679

pathologic features differed significantly between the recurrent
and the non-recurrent groups (Table 1).
The significance of the selected prognostic factors was
compared. Local invasion of tumor was identified unanimously
among the 3 algorithms, as the most important factor in the
prediction of recurrence (Tables 3, 4). In the SVM and ANN
algorithms, local invasion of tumor (NMI: 55.3%, 21.5%),

algorithms, the SVM proved superior to that of the other
algorithms utilized herein. Comparing the BCRSVM based
on SVM with Adjuvant! Online, St. Gallen, and NPI, the
BCRSVM demonstrated superior performance. These results
reveal that the BCRSVM may prove to be an effective method
for the prediction of breast cancer recurrence.
In spite of the superior performance of machine learning
algorithms, use of such algorithms in daily clinical practice
has been quite limited, because they cannot be easily calculated
with traditional calculator. For the convenience of clinicians
interested in the BCRSVM, we developed a tool realizing the
BCRSVM and embedded it in the webpage ( 
ac.kr/bcr/), as shown in Figure 5.
For non-linear modeling, ANN was proposed as a supplement
or alternative to the Cox regression . Recently, SVM
has been employed for non-linear modeling in a variety of
fields, most notably bioinformatics . The SVM has been
well established in the field of machine learning, but is almost
completely unknown, as a cancer predictive and prognostic
method. Thus far, no prognostic models based on clinicopathologic data using SVM have been developed. The SVM was
first proposed by Cortes and Vapnik , and was identified
as a type of a universal feed forward network. It provides us
with a mathematical understanding of the inputs, for which
the learning method is employed. SVM also evidences the
relatively of high recognition ability for practical problems. In
particular, the SVM method is particularly well suited to
problems of a non-linear nature. The SVM helps to create a
high degree of feature space to linearize the non-linear input
spaces, and suggests an optimal segregation aspect for each
feature . One important advantage of the SVM is that the
computational complexity, which is inherent to SVM, can be
reduced via a quadratic optimization problem. SVM tends to
be less prone than ANN to over-fitting problems. Owing to
these advantages, the BCRSVM based on SVM (AUC=0.85)
also evidenced performance superior to that of the ANNbased (AUC=0.80) and the Cox regression-based model
(AUC=0.73).
Seven prognostic factors in the BCRSVM were selected, and
their importance was calculated by NMI (Table 4). Histological grade, tumor size, and number of metastatic lymph nodes
were employed for all other prognostic models, including NPI,
Adjuvant! Online, St. Gallen guidelines and the BCRSVM.
Thus, they appear to be important and consistent prognostic
factors. ER was applied as a prognostic factor in the above
three models, with the exception of NPI. Local invasion of
tumor and number of tumors has not previously been included
in other models, except for the BCRSVM. Based on the NMI
results, ‘local invasion of tumor’ appears to be an important

10.8%), and tumor size (NMI: 0.9%, 4.8%) affected the models
for the prediction of breast cancer recurrence. For the Cox
regression, histological grade, local invasion of tumor, number
of tumors, LVI, and number of metastatic lymph nodes were
associated with higher likelihoods of recurrence (Table 4).
On the basis of accuracy and AUC, SVM outperformed the
ANN and Cox regression algorithms (accuracy=84.6%, 81.4%,
and 72.6%; AUC=0.85, 0.80, and 0.73, respectively) (Table 5,
Figure 3A).
Owing to its superb performance, we developed a prediction
model based on SVM for predicting the recurrence of breast
cancer, and named it as BCRSVM. The BCRSVM model was
then compared with other well-established prognostic models.
The BCRSVM proved superior to other models (AUC=0.85).
Adjuvant! Online and NPI evidenced similar AUC (0.70, 0.71,
respectively) (Table 5). As the St. Gallen guidelines could divide
patients only into low- and high-risk groups, the AUC could
not be calculated. Its sensitivity and NPV were both 1, but its
specificity and PPV were quite low (0.01, 0.13, respectively).
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for each model,
except for St. Gallen, are plotted in Figure 3B. The DFS estimated
by the Kaplan-Meier curve revealed better discrimination of
the high-risk group from the low-risk group in the BCRSVM
than in the Adjuvant! Online or NPI models (Figure 4). Since
the low-risk group identified via the St. Gallen guidelines
included only 2 patients, the DFS curves constructed via St.
Gallen guidelines could not be plotted.
DISCUSSION
This study compared a variety of machine learning algorithms
to develop a novel prognostic model that is superior to that of
the previously employed models for the prognosis of breast
cancer recurrence. Among the various machine learning

prognostic factor for the prediction of recurrence, because it
accounts for 55.3% and 21.5% of importance in the SVM and
ANN models, respectively. Furthermore, the hazard ratio of
‘local invasion of tumor’ in the Cox regression model was also
top-ranked (9.691). However, it was not used in other previous prognostic models, because the local invasion of tumor is
a subjective measure, rather than an objective one. Thus, the
variable may evoke controversy in deciding its’ positivity.
However, crude definition of the variable, such as defined in
this study, may be possibly sufficient, as it is demonstrated in
this study. The process of defining the local invasion of tumor,
in a more precise and objective manner, seems to be yet another
challenge that remains ahead, or another model using purely
objective variables may be required. ER status and tumor size
are well known prognostic factors, however they were not
significant at the Cox regression model. Discrepancy of prognostic factors between prognostic score systems, based on
multivariate analysis, are not unusual, because of the effects of
other prominent covariates or multi-collinearities between the
variables. Possible differences in the characteristics of study
participants, between the studies, may be one of the causes.
We compared and validated the prognostic accuracy of the
SVM and ANN models to those of the other models, including
Adjuvant! Online, St. Gallen guidelines, and NPI. The St.
Gallen guidelines evidenced the highest levels of sensitivity
and NPV. However, via the application of the 2009 St. Gallen
guidelines to test the dataset (n=204), only 2 patients were
allocated to the low-risk group. In the previous study of Ishitobi
et al. , the proportion of low-risk patients, according to
the 1998 and 2009 St. Gallen guidelines, were 0% and 7%,
respectively. Additionally, in other studies, only 10% of patients
were classified as low-risk . This discrepancy in the population of the high-risk group could result in overtreatments
in clinical practice . Jung et al. reported that only a
few patients could avoid adjuvant chemotherapy via the strict
application of St. Gallen guidelines. Although the NPI employs
only three prognostic factors (tumor size, tumor grade, and
lymph node status), its AUC was ranked similarly to that of
Adjuvant! Online. Although the NPI evidenced an AUC similar to that of Adjuvant! Online, the discrepancy in the prediction values was due to the threshold value, which is used to
demarcate the low-risk and the high-risk groups. It may be
necessary, in future studies, to make efforts to readjust the
threshold values. Adjuvant! Online is a well-known web-based
prognostic model, and was validated using external data .
We also attempted to validate Adjuvant! Online using our
dataset, as Adjuvant! Online has yet to be validated in Korea.
The AUCs of Adjuvant! Online were 0.66 and 0.66 ,
respectively. In our study, the AUC of Adjuvant! Online was
0.70, which is similar to or somewhat higher than the previous
results. The AUC of the BCRSVM (0.85) was higher than that
of Adjuvant! Online (0.7) or NPI (0.71). It also exhibited relatively high predictive values for other indicators (Table 5).
Regarding the superior performance of the BCRSVM,
relative to other models, several points could be considered.
The BCRSVM, which involves the SVM algorithm, utilizes
more factors than Adjuvant! Online or NPI. Additionally, as
we employed only one hospital’s data for model development
and evaluation, the BCRSVM might be adjusted to our data.
Therefore, in future studies, it will be necessary to validate the
BCRSVM with external data, such as that acquired from other
hospitals. The BCRSVM’s parameters can be readily adjusted
with different subject populations. It may prove beneficial to
adjust prognostic models of breast cancer recurrence for each
race or country, rather than imposing a universal predictive
model for each. The study was also limited by the possible
selection bias, which is related with the exclusion of 808 patients,
who had no follow-up in the research registry.
In this study, the BCRSVM based on SVM for breast cancer
recurrence was developed, and its performance was compared
with that of the other prognostic models. The BCRSVM could
be easily employed to assist clinicians and patients in making
decisions, regarding breast cancer treatment through internet

authors are currently preparing to conduct a study that would
externally validate such results, with those from other hospitals.
