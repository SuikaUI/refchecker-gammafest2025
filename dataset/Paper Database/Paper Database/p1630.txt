Objectives: To investigate whether medical students’
motivation and Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) change over
time to enhance our understanding of these constructs as
dependent variables in medical education.
Methods: A cohort of first-year students (n=43) at a medical school in South Korea completed a self-report questionnaire on motivation and SRL - the Motivated Strategies for
Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). The same questionnaire
was administered to the same cohort in the beginning of
Year 2. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted to
determine if changes in participants’ MSLQ scores occurred
between in Years 1 and 2.
Results: Forty-one students completed the questionnaires
in both years (95% response rate). Participants’ motivation
scores significantly increased, whereas their SRL scores
decreased significantly after they went through Year 1. The
most notable change in participants’ MLSQ scores was in
the increase in their test anxiety. There was a positive
association between the participants’ test anxiety and their
cognitive strategies use in Year 1, which changed to a
negative one in Year 2. Meanwhile, participants’ test
anxiety scores and their self-regulation scores became more
negatively associated over time.
Conclusions: Our study shows that even as medical students become more motivated, they actually use fewer selfregulated strategies over time. Our findings highlight the
need for change in the medical school’s learning
environment to lessen students’ test anxiety to facilitate
their use of cognitive and meta-cognitive strategies.

Introduction
Theories and research suggest that students’ motivation and
self-regulated learning, which can be conceptualized as
students participating meta-cognitively, motivationally, and
behaviorally actively in their learning,1 are linked to their
cognitive engagement and academic achievement.2 Accordingly, motivation and self-regulated learning have garnered
attention in medical education research. Research has also
related student motivation and self-regulated learning to his
or her performance in medical school.3 Consequently,
medical school curricula are increasingly called upon to
promote students’ self-regulated learning.4
Theories and research suggest that motivation and selfregulated learning are not only mediate learning but are also
consequences of the learning; thus, they are both dependent
and independent variables in medical education.1,5,6 Furthermore, an individual’s motivation and self-regulated
learning may differ according to his or her backgrounds,
such as age and gender.6-8 Therefore, it can be hypothesized
that students’ motivation and self-regulated learning change
over time in medical school and these changes are affected
by several factors. Still, research on motivation and selfregulated learning as dependent variables to student learning and performance is scant in the field of medical education and therefore empirical evidence is lacking.
The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in
medical students’ motivation and self-regulated learning
over time in their medical studies. In doing so, this study
was meant to enhance our understanding of motivation and
self-regulated learning as dependent variables in medical
education, which has implications for inventions for promoting medical students’ motivation and self-regulated

(SKKUSOM) in South Korea. Approximately forty students
were admitted to SKKUSOM annually at the time of this
study: half graduate entrants and half undergraduate
entrants. The curriculum is a four-year program composed
of mostly lecture-based courses in basic medical sciences in
Year 1, and pre-clinical courses in the problem-based
learning format in Year 2, followed by two-year clinical
clerkships. Undergraduate-entry students undertake twoyear premed courses prior to this four-year curriculum.
We measured participants’ motivation and selfregulated learning using five sub-scales adapted from the
Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ).
Based upon the social cognitive theory of learning, MSLQ is
a self-report instrument designed to assess students’ motivational orientations and their use of different learning
strategies.2 This instrument is applicable to and has been
studied in various educational settings - from elementary
classrooms to college courses - and is known to have a
reasonable predictive validity in students’ academic
achievement.2 A few studies were conducted in medical
education research using MSLQ and they also found
association between medical students and trainees’ MSLQ
scores and their academic performance.3, 9-11
The questionnaire consists of 44 items encompassing
motivation and self-regulated learning components. The
motivation component includes three sub-scales: selfefficacy (9 items), intrinsic value (9 items), and test anxiety
(4 items). The self-regulated learning component includes
two sub-scales: cognitive strategy use (13 items: e.g., use of
rehearsal, elaboration, and organizational strategies) and
self-regulation (9 items related to use of metacognitive
strategies - e.g., planning, skimming, and comprehension
monitoring - and effort management). The items were rated
on a five-point Likert scale, from 1 being “strongly disagree”
to 5 being “strongly agree”. The original version in the
English language was translated into Korean by the investigators and was reviewed by experts for validation. The
questionnaire was also pilot tested several times in the
previous years by the authors. Reliability analysis was
performed to examine the internal consistency of this
instrument. The Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.83 to 0.90,
which is considered an acceptable range.12
The same questionnaire was administered twice to the
same cohort of students across two academic years to
investigate changes in their MSLQ scores over time in the
medical program. The first survey was conducted in the first
week of Year 1 in March, 2013. The second survey was
administered a year later in the first week of their second
year in medical school, February, 2014.
Institutional review board (IRB) approval was not requested for the present study, because it was part of the
annual survey of new incoming students, which fell under
the general exemption from our IRB for educational outcomes data.
The data were subjected to descriptive analysis in order
to calculate means for each sub-scale in MSLQ. Additionally, A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted to determine if changes in participants’ MSLQ scores occurred
between in Years 1 and 2. Furthermore, participants’ Year 1
GPAs were compared across genders and across different
entry levels using a Mann-Whitney U test to compare their
baseline performance. Correlation anslysis was also performed to investigate relationpships between variables. We
used SPSS version 20 for Windows for all statistical analyses. All significance was tested at the 95% level of
confidence.
All first-year students (n=43) were invited and agreed to
participate in this study. Two of the participants who
completed the questionnaire in Year 1 were excluded from
the second survey as they had failed to progress and therefore were dropped out of the cohort. Consequently, 41
participants (95.3% of the original cohort) completed the
questionnaires in both years, of whom 70% (n=29) were
male, 30% (n =12) were female. 46% (n=19) of the participants were undergraduate-entry and 54% (n=22) were
graduate-entry students. Participant ages ranged from 20 to
29 (M= 22.8 ± 1.93).
Participants’ Year 1 GPAs differed neither between genders (Z=1.94, p =.11) nor between undergraduate-entry and
graduate-entry students (Z=.98, p=.63). There were no
significant differences in participants’ MSLQ scores in Year
1 across genders, where Z ranges from .71 to .10 and p
ranges from .92 to .47, or across groups of different entry
levels, where Z ranges from 1.33 to .32 and p ranges from
.85 to .07. Figure 1 shows changes in participants’ MSLQ
scores between Year 1 and 2. In terms of the motivational
component in MSLQ, participants’ intrinsic value and test
anxiety scores increased significantly (Z =2.07, 3.15, respectively, p < .05), whereas there were no significant changes in
their self-efficacy scores (Z=1.01, p=.31).

(Z=2.11, 3.02, respectively, p < .05).
Table 1 shows relationships between participants’ test
anxiety scores and their self-regulated learning scores.
Participants’ test anxiety scores were positively associated
with their cognitive strategy use scores in Year 1, but these
became negatively associated in Year 2. Additionally,
participants’ test anxiety and self-regulation scores became
more negatively associated over time.

Discussion
Our findings show that medical students’ motivation and
self-regulated learning change over time. Contrary to the
literature suggesting students use more self-regulation
strategies as they become more motivated,2,13 our study
shows that even as medical students become more motivated, they actually use fewer self-regulated learning over time.
These findings may be attributable to the lecture-driven
curriculum that the study participants went through as the
literature indicates pedagogy and the assessment system
influence students’ motivation and self-regulated learning.6,
14 Still, our findings support the assertion made by White et
al.13 that there is little evidence to suggest that medical
schools are successfully helping medical students become
effective self-regulated learners, in spite of such expectation
held by many medical educators.
The most notable change in students’ MLSQ scores over
time was in their test anxiety. This finding indicates students’ test anxiety increases by the end of Year 1 through
their experiences with assessments in medical school. As
research suggests that student’s test anxiety is negatively
associated with his/her cognitive and metacognitive strategies use,2 it can be speculated that the decrease in students’
cognitive strategy use and self-regulation found in the
present study is associated with their increased test anxiety.
Our findings highlight the need for change in the medical
school’s learning environment to lessen students’ test
anxiety to facilitate their use of cognitive and metacognitive strategies.
The present study has a limitation in that it was performed with a small sample collected from a single site.
Accordingly, future research is warranted with a larger
sample to enhance the generalizability of our findings.
Furthermore, our study investigated students over one year
only when they were in the phase of the curriculum largely
dependent on lectures. A longitudinal study is warranted to
investigate whether the same pattern of changes continues
when the learning environment shifts away from lectures
and move towards a more self-directed one, such as problem-based learning courses and learning in clinical settings,
as they progress through the years in medical school.
