System Analysis via Integral Quadratic Constraints
Alexandre Megretski, Member, IEEE, and Anders Rantzer, Member, IEEE
Abstract—This paper introduces a uniﬁed approach to robustness analysis with respect to nonlinearities, time variations, and
uncertain parameters. From an original idea by Yakubovich, the
approach has been developed under a combination of inﬂuences
from the Western and Russian traditions of control theory.
It is shown how a complex system can be described, using
integral quadratic constraints (IQC’s) for its elementary components. A stability theorem for systems described by IQC’s is
presented that covers classical passivity/dissipativity arguments
but simpliﬁes the use of multipliers and the treatment of causality.
A systematic computational approach is described, and relations
to other methods of stability analysis are discussed. Last, but
not least, the paper contains a summarizing list of IQC’s for
important types of system components.

I. INTRODUCTION
T IS common engineering practice to work with the simplest possible models in design of control systems. In
particular, one often uses linear time-invariant plant models,
for which there exist a well-established theory and commercially available computer tools that help in the design.
Experiments, often preceded by simulations with more accurate models, are used to verify that the design also works
well in practice. There is also a strong need for more formal
ways to analyze the systems. Such analysis can help to identify
critical experimental circumstances or parameter combinations
and estimate the power of the models.
In the 1960–70’s, a large body of results was developed in
this direction, often referred to as “absolute stability theory.”
The basic idea was to partition the system into a feedback
interconnection of two positive operators; see – and the
references therein. To improve the ﬂexibility of the approach,
so-called multipliers were used to select proper variables for
the partitioning. The absolute stability theory is now considered a fundamental component of the theory for nonlinear
systems. However, the applicability of many of the results
has been limited by computational problems and by restrictive
causality conditions used in the multiplier theory.
For computation of multipliers, substantial progress has
been made in the last decade, the most evident example being
algorithms for computation of structured singular values .

analysis) . As a result, robustness analysis with respect
to uncertain parameters and unmodeled dynamics can be
performed with great accuracy. An even more fundamental
breakthrough in this direction is the development of polynomial time algorithms for convex optimization with constraints
deﬁned by linear matrix inequalities , . Such problems
appear not only in
-analysis but also in almost any analysis
setup based on concepts of passivity-type.
The purpose of this paper is to address the second obstacle to
efﬁcient analysis by proving that multipliers can be introduced
in a less restrictive manner, without causality constraints.
Not only does this make the theory more accessible by
simpliﬁcation of proofs, but it also enhances the development
of computer tools that support the transformation of model
structure assumptions into numerically tractable optimization
The concept integral quadratic constraint (IQC) is used for
several purposes:
• to exploit structural information about perturbations;
• to characterize properties of external signals;
• to analyze combinations of several perturbations and
external signals.
Implicitly, IQC’s have always been used in stability theory.
For example, positivity of an operator
can be expressed by
In the 1960’s, most of the stability theory was devoted to
scalar feedback systems. This led to conveniently visualizable
stability criteria based on the Nyquist diagram, which was
particularly important in times when computers were less
accessible.
In the 1970’s, IQC’s were explicitly used by Yakubovich
to treat the stability problem for systems with advanced
nonlinearities, including amplitude and frequency modulation
systems. Some new IQC’s were introduced, and the so-called
-procedure was applied to the case of multiple constraints
 . Willems also gave an energy-related interpretation of the
stability results, in terms of dissipativity, storage functions,
and supply rates . Later on, Safonov interpreted the stability
results geometrically, in terms of separation of the graphs of
the two operators in the feedback loop.
An important step in further development was the introduction of analysis methods which essentially rely on the use of
computers. One example is the theory for quadratic stabilization , , and another is the multiloop generalization of
the circle criterion based on D-scaling , . Both search
for a Lyapunov function, and the search for D-scales can be

interpreted as optimization of parameters in an IQC. Another
direction was the introduction of
optimization for the
synthesis of robust controllers , . Again, the results
can be viewed in terms of IQC’s, since optimal design with
respect to an IQC leads to
optimization.
During the last decade, a variety of methods has been
developed within the area of robust control. As was pointed
out in , many of them can be reformulated to fall within
the framework of IQC’s. This will be further demonstrated
in the current paper, which presents a minimal framework for
the stability analysis of feedback interconnections described in
terms of IQC’s. In Section II, deﬁnitions and a main theorem
are given in detail. They are illustrated in Section III by an
extensive example, analyzing a system with saturation and
an uncertain delay. Then, follow sections with discussions
and comparisons to well-known results. Finally, we give a
summarizing list of IQC’s for important types of system
components.

B. What Is an IQC?
IQC’s provide a way of representing relationships between
processes evolving in a complex dynamical system, in a form
that is convenient for analysis.
Depending on the particular application, various versions
of IQC’s are available. Two signals

There is, however, an evident problem in using IQC’s in
stability analysis. This is because both (1) and (2), (3) make
sense only if the signals
are square summable. If it is not
known a priori that the system is stable, then the signals might
not be square summable.1 This will be resolved as follows.
First, the system is considered as depending on a parameter

II. A BASIC STABILITY THEOREM
The following feedback conﬁguration, illustrated in Fig. 1,
is the basic object of study in this paper:
1One could suggest using integrals “from 0 to T” in (2) instead of the
integrals “from 0 to 1,” as is often done in the literature. It can be shown,
however, that for many important components (such as a saturation), some
useful IQC’s hold in the form (2), but their counterparts “from 0 to T” are
not valid (see Section IV).

In most applications, well-posedness is equivalent to the
existence, uniqueness, and continuability of solutions of the
underlying differential equations and is relatively easy to
verify. Regarding stability, it is often desirable to verify
some kind of
exponential stability. However, for general
classes of ordinary differential equations, exponential stability
is equivalent to the input/output stability introduced above

A. Example with Saturation and Delay
Consider the following feedback system with control saturation and an uncertain delay:

plot on Fig. 3), and
is the function that represents the saturation. The setup is
illustrated in Fig. 2.

and the resulting inequality (9) gives the minor improvement
A Popov plot is shown in Fig. 4.
Furthermore, because the saturation is monotone and odd, it
is possible to apply a much stronger result, obtained by Zames
and Falb . By their statement, a sufﬁcient condition for
stability is the existence of a function

This shows that the feedback system is indeed stable for all
and concludes the stability analysis in the undelayed

Considering also the delay uncertainty, the problem is to ﬁnd
a bound on the maximal stabilizing feedback gain for a given
delay bound. A crude bound can be received directly from the
small gain theorem, stating that, because of the gain bound
, the feedback interconnection of
is stable, provided that
Not surprisingly, this condition is conservative. For example,
it does not utilize any bound on the delay. In order to do that,
it is useful to generate more IQC’s for the delay component.
First, we rewrite (12) as a feedback interconnection on Fig. 1,

By integrating the point-wise inequalities (17) with some
nonnegative rational functions, one can obtain a huge set of
IQC’s valid for the uncertain delay. Using these in combination
with some set of IQC’s for the saturation nonlinearity, one can
estimate the region of stability for the system given in (12).

The guaranteed instability region was obtained analytically
by considering the behavior of the system in the linear

IV. HARD AND SOFT IQC’S
As a rule, an IQC is an inequality describing correlation
between the input and output signals of a causal block

. Such IQC’s
are called hard IQC’s, in contrast to the more general soft
IQC’s, which need not hold for ﬁnite-time intervals. Some of
the most simple IQC’s are hard, but the “generic” ones are not.
Example: A simple example of a soft IQC is the one used
in the Popov criterion. If

In the theory of absolute stability, the use of soft IQC’s
was often referred to as allowing “noncausal multipliers.”
While for scalar systems this was usually not a serious
problem, the known conditions for applicability of noncausal
multipliers were far too restrictive for multivariable systems.
The formulation of Theorem 1 makes it possible (and easy)
to use soft IQC’s in a very general situation. For example,
consider the following corollary.
Corollary 1 (Noncausal Multipliers): Assume that Condition i) of Theorem 1 is satisﬁed. If there exist some

IQC’s can be used to describe an external signal (noise or a
reference) entering the system. The “virtual experiment” setup
for a signal
is shown on Fig. 8. The setup clearly shows
the “spectral analysis” nature of IQC’s describing the signals.
Mathematically, the resulting IQC has the form

Performance analysis of systems can be made with both
interior blocks and external signals described in terms of
V. IQC’S AND QUADRATIC STABILITY
There is a close relationship between quadratic stability and
stability analysis based on IQC’s. As a rule, if a system is
quadratically stable, then its stability can also be proved by
using a simple IQC. Conversely, a system that can be proved to
be stable via IQC’s always has a quadratic Lyapunov function
in some generalized sense. However, to actually present this
Lyapunov function, one has to extend the state space of the
system (by adding the states of
from Fig. 7). Even then,
in the case of soft IQC’s, the Lyapunov function does not need
to be sign-deﬁnite and may not decrease monotonically along
the system trajectories. In any case, use of IQC’s replaces
the “blind” search for a quadratic Lyapunov function, which
is typical for the quadratic stability, by a more sophisticated
search. In general, for example in the case of so-called
“parameter-dependent” Lyapunov functions, the relationship
with the IQC type analysis has yet to be clariﬁed.
Below we formulate and prove a result on the relationship
between a simple version of quadratic stability and IQC’s. Let

sufﬁcient condition of stability of (21).
Now we have the two seemingly different conditions for
stability of (21), both expressed in terms of systems of LMI’s:
quadratic stability (22) and IQC-stability (24), (25). The ﬁrst
condition has

L. IQC’s for Signals
Performance of a linear control system is often measured in
terms of disturbance attenuation. An important issue is then the
deﬁnition of the set of expected external signals. Here again,
IQC’s can be used as a ﬂexible tool, for example to specify
bounds on auto correlation, frequency distribution, or even to
characterize a given ﬁnite set of signals. Then, the information
given by the IQC’s can be used in the performance analysis,
along the lines discussed in and .
M. IQC’s from Robust Performance
One of the most appealing features of IQC’s is their ability
to widen the ﬁeld of application of already existing results.
This means that almost any robustness result derived by some
method (possibly unrelated to the IQC techniques) for a special
class of systems can be translated into an IQC.
As an example of such a “translation,” consider the feedback
interconnection of a particular linear time-invariant system
with an “uncertain” block
is the external disturbance. Assume that stability
of this interconnection (i.e., the invertibility of the operator
) is already proved, and, moreover, an upper bound
on the induced
gain “from
” (“robust performance”)
for any square summable
satisfying (32). Then, since for any square summable
exists a square summable
satisfying (32),
satisﬁes the IQC given by
This IQC implies stability of system (32) via Theorem 1 but
can also be used in the analysis of systems with additional
feedback blocks, as well as with different nominal transfer
functions.
For example, consider the uncertain block

nontrivial IQC’s can be derived, based on a particular robust
performance result. Consider the feedback interconnection of

VII. CONCLUSIONS
The objective of the paper was to give an overview of the
IQC-based stability analysis, featuring a basic stability theorem
and a list of the most important IQC’s. Depending on the
application, several modiﬁcations of the basic framework can
be used, providing more ﬂexibility in the analysis as well as
open problems for future research.
Unconditional and Conditional IQC’s: In this paper, an
was said to satisfy an IQC if (1) was satisﬁed for
. Such an IQC can
be called “unconditional,” because it does not depend on the
environment in which the block
is being used. Using such
IQC’s is easy and convenient, in particular because they can
be derived independently of the system setup (or be found
in the literature). Sometimes, however, unconditional IQC’s
lead to unjustiﬁed conservatism in the analysis. Consider, for
simplicity, the system
is a given nonlinear function. Here the set of possible
is relatively small [it is parameterized by the
initial data parameter
]. Therefore, it may be an “overkill”
to consider the relation between
for all square
summable . It should be sufﬁcient to look only at those

the “unconditional” IQC (2) with
does not hold for any
. However, it holds (with
sufﬁciently small ) as a conditional IQC whenever
is a nonsingular matrix.
Average IQC’s: The “average” IQC’s are especially useful
in their conditional form when one is working with stochastic
system models. These IQC’s are deﬁned by replacing (2) with
Incremental IQC’s: For nonlinear systems, as a rule, the
standard IQC’s (1) are good only for showing that the signals
within the system are “small” (are square summable, tend to
zero, etc.) However, many interesting questions, for example the study of the existence and properties of a globally
attractive periodic response to any periodic input, require
deeper information about the system. This can be supplied
by incremental IQC’s. An unconditional incremental IQC
describing the operator
has the form (1), where
