In recent years, digital media and networks have become embedded in our everyday lives,
and are part of broad-based changes to how we engage in knowledge production, communication, and creative expression. Unlike the early years in the development of computers and
computer-based media, digital media are now commonplace and pervasive, having been taken
up by a wide range of individuals and institutions in all walks of life. Digital media have
escaped the boundaries of professional and formal practice, and the academic, governmental, and industry homes that initially fostered their development. Now they have been taken
up by diverse populations and non-institutionalized practices, including the peer activities
of youth. Although speciﬁc forms of technology uptake are highly diverse, a generation is
growing up in an era where digital media are part of the taken-for-granted social and cultural
fabric of learning, play, and social communication.
In 2005, The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation began a new grant-making
initiative in the area of digital media and learning. An initial set of exploratory grants in the
study of youth practices and the development of digital literacy programs has expanded into
a major initiative spanning research, educational reform, and technology development. One
component of this effort is the support of this book series. As part of the broader MacArthur
Foundation initiative, this series is aimed at timely dissemination of new scholarship, fostering an interdisciplinary conversation, and archiving the best research in this emerging ﬁeld.
Through the course of producing the six initial volumes, the foundation convened a set of
meetings to discuss the framing issues for this book series. As a result of these discussions we
identiﬁed a set of shared commitments and areas of focus. Although we recognize that the
terrain is being reshaped even as we seek to identify it, we see these as initial frames for the
ongoing work to be put forward by this series.
This book series is founded upon the working hypothesis that those immersed in new
digital tools and networks are engaged in an unprecedented exploration of language, games,
social interaction, problem solving, and self-directed activity that leads to diverse forms of
learning. These diverse forms of learning are reﬂected in expressions of identity, how individuals express independence and creativity, and in their ability to learn, exercise judgment,
and think systematically.
The deﬁning frame for this series is not a particular theoretical or disciplinary approach,
nor is it a ﬁxed set of topics. Rather, the series revolves around a constellation of topics
investigated from multiple disciplinary and practical frames. The series as a whole looks
at the relation between youth, learning, and digital media, but each book or essay might
deal with only a subset of this constellation. Erecting strict topical boundaries can exclude
some of the most important work in the ﬁeld. For example, restricting the content of the
series only to people of a certain age means artiﬁcially reifying an age boundary when the
phenomenon demands otherwise. This becomes particularly problematic with new forms of
online participation where one important outcome is the mixing of participants of different
ages. The same goes for digital media, which are increasingly inseparable from analog and
earlier media forms.
In the case of learning, digital media are part of the redeﬁnition and broadening of existing boundaries of practice and our understanding of what learning means. The term learning
was chosen rather than education in order to ﬂag an interest in settings both within and
outside the classroom. Many of the more radical challenges to existing learning agendas
are happening in domains such as gaming, online networks, and amateur production that
usually occur in informal and non-institutional settings. This does not mean we are prejudiced against learning as it happens in the classroom or other formal educational settings.
Rather, we hope to initiate a dialog about learning as it spans settings that are more explicitly
educational and those that are not.
The series and the MacArthur Foundation initiative respond to certain changes in our
media ecology that have important implications for learning. Speciﬁcally, these are new
forms of media literacy and changes in the modes of media participation. Digital media are
part of a convergence between interactive media (most notably gaming), online networks,
and existing media forms. Navigating this media ecology involves a palette of literacies that
are being deﬁned through practice but require more scholarly scrutiny before they can be
fully incorporated pervasively into educational initiatives. Media literacy involves not only
ways of understanding, interpreting, and critiquing media, but also the means for creative
and social expression, online search and navigation, and a host of new technical skills. The
potential gap in literacies and participation skills creates new challenges for educators who
struggle to bridge media engagement inside and outside the classroom.
The shift toward interactive media, peer-to-peer forms of media communication, and
many-to-many forms of distribution relate to types of participation that are more bottom-up
and driven by the “user” or “consumer” of media. Audiences have always had the opportunity to “talk back” to corporate media or to create their own local media forms. However, the
growing dominance of gaming as a media format, the advent of low-cost digital production
tools, and online distribution means a much more dynamic range in who participates and
how they participate in the production and distribution of media. Gamers expect that media
are subject to player control. Add to this the fact that all forms of media are increasingly
being contextualized in an online communication ecology where creative production and
expression is inseparable from social communication. Finally, new low-cost digital production tools mean that amateur and casual media creators can author, edit, and distribute
video and other rich media forms that were once prohibitively expensive to produce and
share with others.
We value the term participation for the ways in which it draws attention to situated learning
theory, social media literacies, and mobilized forms of media engagement. Digital media
networks support existing forms of mass media distribution as well as smaller publics and
collectivities that might center on peer groups or specialized niche interests. The presence
of social communication, professional media, and amateur niche media in shared online
spaces introduces a kind of leveling effect, where small media players gain new visibility
and the position of previously authoritative media is challenged. The clash between more
socially driven or niche publics and the publics deﬁned by professional forms of media is
playing out in high-proﬁle battles in domains such as intellectual property law, journalism,
entertainment, and government. For our purposes, the questions surrounding knowledge
and credibility and young people’s use of digital media to circumvent adult authority are
particularly salient.
The emerging power shift, where smaller and edge players are gaining more visibility and
voice, is particularly important to children and youth. If we look at children and youth
through the lens of digital media, we have a population that has been historically subject to
a high degree of systematic and institutional control in the kinds of information and social
communication to which they have access. This is one reason why the alchemy between
youth and digital media has been distinctive; it disrupts the existing set of power relations
between adult authority and youth voice. While many studies of children, youth, and media
have for decades stressed the status of young people as competent and full social subjects,
digital media increasingly insist that we acknowledge this viewpoint. Not only must we see
youth as legitimate social and political actors, but we must also recognize them as potential
innovators and drivers of new media change.
This does not mean that we are uncritical of youth practices or that we believe that digital
media necessarily hold the key to empowerment. Rather, we argue against technological
determinism, stressing the need for balanced scholarship that recognizes the importance
of our current moment within the context of existing structures and unfolding histories.
This means placing contemporary changes within a historical context as well as working
to highlight the diversity in the landscape of media and media uptake. Neither youth nor
digital media are monolithic categories; documenting how speciﬁc youth take up particular
forms of media with diverse learning outcomes is critical to this series as a whole. Digital
media take the form they do because they are created by existing social and cultural contexts,
contexts that are diverse and stratiﬁed.
As with earlier shifts in media environments, this current turn toward digital media and
networks has been accompanied by fear and panic as well as elevated hopes. This is particularly true of adult perception of children and youth who are at the forefront of experimentation with new media forms, and who mobilize digital media to push back at existing
structures of power and authority. While some see “digital kids” as our best hope for the
future, others worry that new media are part of a generational rift and a dangerous turn away
from existing standards for knowledge, literacy, and civic engagement. Careful, socially engaged, and accessible scholarship is crucial to informing this public debate and related policy
decisions. Our need to understand the relation between digital media and learning is urgent
because of the scale and the speed of the changes that are afoot. The shape and uses of digital
media are still very much in ﬂux, and this book series seeks to be part of the deﬁnition of
our sociotechnical future.

Changing Citizenship in the Digital Age
W. Lance Bennett
University of Washington, Seattle, Center for Communication and Civic Engagement
Democracy is not a sure thing. Governments and party systems often strain against changes
in societies, and some fall prey to corruption and bad policies. Under the right conditions,
people may reassert their rights to govern, and produce remarkable periods of creative reform, realignment, and change. In these times, politics becomes a focus of personal life itself,
restoring the sense that participation makes a difference. The challenges of inﬂuencing the
course of nations and addressing global issues may inspire creative solutions from the generations of young citizens who have access to digital communication tools. The cascading
advance of media platforms and social software enables unprecedented levels of production
and distribution of ideas, public deliberation, and network organization.
It is clear that many young citizens of this digital and global age have demonstrated interests in making contributions to society. Yet the challenge of engaging effectively with
politics that are linked to spheres of government remains, for most, a daunting prospect.
The reasons are numerous. A casual look at world democracies suggests that many of the
most established ones are showing signs of wear. Parties are trying to reinvent themselves
while awkwardly staying the course that keeps them in power. In the press, in everyday
conversation, and often from the mouths of politicians, politics has become a dirty word
rather than a commonly accepted vocabulary for personal expression.1 Perhaps most notably, younger generations have disconnected from conventional politics and government
in alarming numbers. These trends in youth dissatisfaction with conventional political engagement are not just occurring in the United States, but have parallels in other democracies
as well, including Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.2 The pathways to disconnection from government are many: adults are frequently negative about politics, the tone
of the press is often cynical, candidates seldom appeal directly to young voters on their own
terms about their concerns, politicians have poisoned the public well (particularly in the
United States) with vitriol and negative campaigning, and young people see the media ﬁlled
with inauthentic performances from ofﬁcials who are staged by professional communication
managers.3 Paralleling these developments has been a notable turning away from public life
into online friendship networks, gaming and entertainment environments, and consumer
The author would like to thank Peter Levine, Alan Schussman, Cathy Davidson, and Chris Wells for
their helpful comments on this chapter. In addition, the lively discussions both on- and ofﬂine among
all the authors in this volume have informed and changed my thinking on many aspects of citizenship
and digital learning. The online discussions with an impressive group of participants further added to
the intellectual stimulation of this project. Thanks to everyone who so generously shared their time and
creative spirits.

pursuits. Where political activity occurs, it is often related to lifestyle concerns that seem
outside the realm of government.4
Many observers properly note that there are impressive signs of youth civic engagement in
these nongovernmental areas, including increases in community volunteer work, high levels
of consumer activism, and impressive involvement in social causes from the environment to
economic injustice in local and global arenas.5 Some even ascribe civic engagement qualities
to many activities that occur in online social networking and entertainment communities.
For example, Henry Jenkins, Cathy Davidson, Mimi Ito, and Jochai Benkler argue that many
forms of shared activity online (from blogging, to conﬂict and protest behavior in gaming,
fan and entertainment sites) represent forms of civic or media engagement.6 The chapter by
Earl and Schussman in this volume makes a good case that online petitions to entertainment
and media corporations constitute a kind of social activism that displays skills mirroring
social movement repertoires of action.
Many of the spontaneous and creative forms of collective expression online seem more
appealing than the options typically offered in youth engagement sites sponsored by governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in efforts to invigorate public life
for young people. In Coleman’s concluding chapter in this volume we learn that many
well-intentioned youth engagement sites have clear ideas about what constitute proper citizen activities. As a result, these managed environments seem inauthentic and irrelevant to
many young people. Indeed, Coleman’s survey of managed (government- and NGO-built and
-operated) and autonomous (youth-built and -operated) sites in the U.K. suggests that young
citizens ﬁnd more authentic experiences in edgier political sites and in entertainment media
and games. The dilemma is that many of the political sites that young people build and
operate themselves may avoid formal government channels for communication and action
and may lack the resources needed to sustain and grow them.
A key question thus becomes how to nurture the creative and expressive actions of a
generation in change, while continuing to keep some positive engagement with government
on their screens.
Two Paradigms of Youth Engagement
One goal of this chapter is to note and explore the sharply differing views of what constitutes civic engagement and citizenship for young people both on and off line. Indeed,
there seem to be two different paradigms that contrast young citizens (roughly in the ﬁfteen to twenty-ﬁve age range) as either reasonably active and engaged or relatively passive
and disengaged. Like all paradigms, each foregrounds different core organizing values and
principles, prompting proponents to weigh and select different sets of supporting facts and
reasons. Each paradigm thus comes equipped with its own arguments and evidence, making
it convincing to adherents and elusive and often maddening to those operating from the
other constructed reality.7
The engaged youth paradigm implicitly emphasizes generational changes in social identity
that have resulted in the growing importance of peer networks and online communities.
In this view, if there is an attendant decline in the credibility or authenticity of many
public institutions and discourses that deﬁne conventional political life, the fault lies more
with the government performances and news narratives than with citizens who cannot
engage with them.8 In an important sense, this paradigm emphasizes the empowerment
of youth as expressive individuals and symbolically frees young people to make their own
Changing Citizenship in the Digital Age
creative choices. In the bargain, the engaged youth paradigm also eases the overriding duty
to participate in conventional government-centered activities. In many cases, researchers
in this school are only dimly aware of (and may tend to discount) research on declines
and deﬁcits in more conventional political participation among young citizens. As a result,
the engaged youth paradigm opens the door to a new spectrum of civic actions in online
arenas from MySpace to World of Warcraft. By contrast, the disengaged youth paradigm may
acknowledge the rise of more autonomous forms of public expression such as consumer
politics, or the occasional protest in MySpace, while keeping the focus on the generational
decline in connections to government (e.g., voting patterns) and general civic involvement
(e.g., following public affairs in the news) as threats to the health of democracy itself.
A typical exchange in a series of online discussions that accompanied the development of
this volume found Jochai Benkler listing a variety of sites as examples of engaged youth, including the Harry Potter fan publication of the ﬁctional wizard newspaper, the Daily Prophet.
He also offered as evidence a Pew study showing that a majority of bloggers are under thirty,
and roughly one third of them think of what they are doing as journalism. In his view, a
faculty-student network for providing medicines to poor countries “must have missed the
memo about lack of political engagement in today’s youth.”9 In response, Ulises Mejias acknowledged the existence of some forms of civic life on the Web but expressed the following
concerns: “If voting and reading the newspaper are deemed antiquated forms of civic participation, what kind of public sphere is being created by new forms of participation such as
blogging, news aggregating, etc.? . . . the question is: what participant interests mold democracy’s new architecture of participation? . . . Yes, there are important alternative spaces, but as
the Pew study that Yochai cites points out, while a minority is interested in exploiting these
uses for pro-social political action, the majority of users are content to view the technologies
as means for individual expression (articulated through consumer choices).”10
This exchange, along with many others, show that the same evidence can be interpreted
differently when placed in different paradigm frames. One root of the difference is that
the two paradigms reﬂect different normative views of what the good citizen ought to do
when she grows up. The engaged youth viewpoint, in a sense, empowers young people by
recognizing personal expression and their capacity to project identities in collective spaces.
As Cathy Davidson noted in the online discussions, “. . . I think we have a unique opportunity
to take advantage of peer-to-peer sites for creative, imaginative, activist learning purposes.
That is a lot harder mission than critiquing the young. . . . I want to be attuned to what
youth themselves say about the alternative forms of learning and social networking afforded
by Web 2.0.”11
By contrast, those who lean toward the disengaged youth perspective often worry about
this very personalization or privatization of the political sphere and focus more on how to
promote public actions that link to government as the center of democratic politics, and to
other social groups and institutions as the foundations of civic life. As David Buckingham
(editor of the MacArthur series volume on identity) put it:
Part of me would agree that we do need to be worried, although I would accept that disengagement is
a fairly understandable response to what currently seems to count as “public affairs.” Yes, new media
may be offering new possibilities for civic participation, at least for some—although we need to know if
this is just for the “usual suspects.” . . .
But the point that worries me a little is the Harry Potter anecdote. OK, young people may well be
participating and engaging in all sorts of very active and interesting ways online; and we could probably
think of many other examples. But in what ways is this CIVIC engagement? . . . “media engagement” is
Civic Life Online
not necessarily the same as “civic engagement.” I would accept other people’s comments to the effect
that this term “civic” is a little worthy and moralistic... but how, in the end, are we deﬁning what counts
as “civic,” and what doesn’t?
I would suggest that “civic” implies some notion of the public (the polis or the public sphere, even)—
by which I suppose I mean an open debate about issues of general social concern between people who
may not agree with each other. In this respect, there are certainly tendences in the internet towards
an individualisation, or at least a fragmentation, of social/political debate (a settling into established
niche groups). So there may be ways in which the internet promotes participation, but undermines the
“civic.”. . . 12
And so the debate goes, often with real consequences in the worlds in which young
people work, play, learn, and vote. As Cathy Davidson, Peter Levine, Howard Rheingold,
and Henry Jenkins, among others, have pointed out, the disengaged youth viewpoint leads
to something of a narrative of despair or decline about young citizens, one that travels
all to easily in the news and leads to overlooking the many innovations that young people have brought to our public communication spaces.13 At the same time, Lew Friedland,
Michael Delli Carpini, Zephyr Teachout, Peter Levine, and others have noted that traditional activities such as voting continue to matter, and young people hold the future of
our democratic life insofar as citizens can still shape their political institutions. Some of
these observers, including this author, straddle the two perspectives while seeking to bridge
and transcend them. For example, Peter Levine has contrasted the core elements of the
two narratives about young people, beginning with what the decline story often leaves
The narrative of decline overlooks creative developments, often led by youth, that may be
building the foundations of civil society in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
The decline story overlooks ways that various subpopulations engage on issues of special
concern to them. For example, African American youth may be well informed about Katrina. (. . . African American youth are generally more politically engaged than White American
youth, across the board).
It overlooks certain positive trends in youth engagement, such as a steep rise in the volunteering rate in the United States.
It focuses narrowly on youth, without recognizing that many declines in participation are
evident among all age groups.
It treats a withdrawal from major institutions (such as elections and the press) as a
decline, when these trends may actually reﬂect growing sophistication. Perhaps youth
are deliberately and wisely choosing not to endorse forms of participation that are
The last point underlines the fact that “civic engagement” is a deeply normative concept. It
is impossible to decide whether recent trends in engagement are good or bad—or important or
meaningless—without developing a full-blown political theory.
I think that there is a problem with youth civic engagement, but it is not located inside young people’s heads. Institutions are also at fault. Telling young people to participate
in bad institutions is mere propaganda. On the other hand, young people need to be taught
and encouraged to take part in reform efforts and other aspects of politics. Political participation does not come naturally, nor do powerful institutions have incentives to encourage it. In short, we must not only prepare citizens for politics but also improve politics for
Changing Citizenship in the Digital Age
From my perspective, several trends in youth civic engagement are troubling. These trends are
symptoms of institutional failure, poor civic education, and cultural forces that work against democratic participation. Selected survey results (see box for details) for U.S. residents, age eighteen to
twenty-ﬁve show:
A decline in face-to-face, local participation—except volunteering. This decline precedes the
rise of the Internet. The increase in volunteering is often attributed to service programs and
requirements in high schools and colleges.
A big decline in all forms of election-related participation and protest until 2004, when there
was a substantial increase.
A big decline in interest in the news and public affairs, accompanied by falling trust in the
press—both of which occurred before the rise of the Internet. (I would blame the press, rather
than youth, for this trend.)
A big decline in trust for other people, but no change in beliefs about government’s responsiveness. (Also, young adults are somewhat more conﬁdent in the government than their
elders.)14
These divergent views of youth engagement shape the thinking of policymakers and educators concerned about getting young people involved in civic life. When set side by side, the
broader picture seems to point to changing the institutional and communication environments in which young people encounter politics, rather than somehow ﬁxing the attitudes
of youth themselves. Yet the institutional and communication environments themselves are
politically contested, and often produce anemic and restricted (what Coleman would call
heavily managed) experiences with credible or authentic politics. How many textbooks (or
classroom teachers, who are monitored by school ofﬁcials and parents) acknowledge that it
makes sense for young people to follow the political lead of a rock star, such as Coldplay’s
Chris Martin, who encouraged concert goers to join Oxfam’s Make Trade Fair campaign? Yet
many Coldplay fans actually connected with government on their own: the band’s 2003 U.S.
tour included Oxfam workers at concerts gathering some 10,000 postcards to send to President Bush, asking him to stop dumping subsidized exports such as rice on poor countries
where farmers could no longer proﬁt from growing the same crops.15 For those who were
not at the concerts, a visit to the band’s Web site contained a link off the home page to the
fair trade campaign materials.
Such pathways to political engagement are often not accommodated in traditional civic
education and or government sponsored e-citizen sites, leaving many young citizens at
odds with brittle conceptions of proper citizenship imposed upon them by educators, public ofﬁcials, and other institutional authorities. Even when more creative civic education
and engagement approaches enable young people to trace their own personal concerns
through the governmental process, the end result may crash against the palpable failure of
governments, parties, and candidates to recognize the communication and identity preferences of young citizens, as illustrated so clearly in the chapter by Xenos and Foot in this
An important task of this chapter and the volume as a whole is to clarify the different
assumptions about citizenship and engagement that underlie the often-competing views of
the political and civic lives of young citizens. Clarifying and building bridges between the
paradigms is necessary in order to better promote constructive dialogue among researchers
and clearer policy and practice among educators, youth workers, parties, campaigns, and
public ofﬁcials.

(Mis)Communicating with Young Citizens
Perhaps one of the most obvious factors contributing to the relatively passive, disengaged
stance of many young people toward government and formal elements of politics is the
withering away of civic education in schools. Not only have civics offerings been in decline,
notably the United States, but, where offered, the curriculum is often stripped of independent
opportunities for young people to embrace and communicate about politics on their own
terms. (I shall return to this important problem later in the chapter.) The result is that there is
often little connection between the academic presentation of politics and the acquisition of
skills that might help develop engaged citizens. A massive International Education Association (IEA) survey of 90,000 fourteen-year-olds in twenty-eight nations suggested that civic education, where it is offered, remains largely a textbook based experience, largely severed from
the vibrant experiences of politics that might help young people engage with public life.16
Even in nations that do reasonably well at imparting some basic civic knowledge to young
citizens, there are signs of relatively little carryover to participation in public life. For example,
a study of Australian civic education in the late 1990s concluded that “the importance of
civic knowledge has been well established. . . Yet knowledge itself will be of little relevance
Civic Life Online
if it does not lead to action in the civic sphere. . . .”17 What emerges from different national
surveys is something of a generational shift in which young citizens tend to express areas of
interest and concern but often see those interests as unconnected, or even negatively related,
to government. For example, the Australian survey associated with the IEA project assessed
the political and social attitudes of 3,000 students in 150 high schools. The students were
largely disinterested in government, while interested in a brand of civic engagement that
the researchers described as a “social movement citizenship.” Youth orientations deﬁned
under the category “conventional citizenship” were not encouraging: 83 percent who felt
that is was not important to join a political party, only 55 percent thought it was important
for a citizen to know about the country’s history, a bare 50 percent though it important to
follow issues in the media, and fully 66 percent found it unimportant for citizens to engage in
political discussions. The “social movement” citizen proﬁle presented an interesting contrast:
80 percent regarded participating in activities to beneﬁt others as important, 74 percent
regarded it important to act to protect the environment, and 68 percent were concerned
about human rights.18
Broadly similar patterns were found among young people in a survey of political attitudes
of Americans at the turn of the millennium.19 Beyond the mixed attitudes toward political
engagement, the American sample revealed interesting signs of generational cohesion among
those immersed in digital media. The so-called dotnet generation expressed a strong sense of
generational identiﬁcation, in contrast to so-called generation X who came of age amidst the social and economic turbulence of the
global economy of the 1980s and 1990s, but did not ﬁnd their early social bearings online as
did the dotnets.20 A subsequent survey released in 2006 indicated that while levels of dotnet
identiﬁcation had declined as the shock of 9/11 faded (from 69 to 56 percent of the same
cohort indicating strong generational identiﬁcation), the level of generational coherence
remained strong.21
We know that digital media provide those young people who have access to it an important set of tools to build social and personal identity and to create the on- and ofﬂine
environments in which they spend their time. However, as Howard Rheingold notes in this
volume, many young people live online, but they may lack the skills to communicate their
common concerns in effective ways to larger (public) audiences. Rheingold suggests building
a public communication digital media skill set. Peter Levine then discusses the importance
of ﬁnding audiences that recognize those public expressions once the communication skills
have been sharpened.
Perhaps the major puzzle running through all of this is how to create the media environments in which online communities can build the kinds of social capital—those bonds of
trust and commitment to shared values—that lead to participation in civic life and the political world beyond. Every chapter in this volume explores some aspect of this puzzle, from
the online environments available in elections (Xenos and Foot), youth engagement sites
(Montgomery, Raynes-Goldie and Walker, Coleman), civic education programs (Rheingold,
Levine, Bers), and entertainment sites (Earl and Schussman) to the overarching policy issues
that may keep the internet free and viable for noncommercial civic spaces to continue to
emerge (Montgomery).
As suggested by the two paradigms of youth engagement, there is a distinct possibility
that the entire question of civic engagement is confounded by how one chooses to deﬁne
citizenship itself. Should young citizens be like the generations before and have an ingrained
Changing Citizenship in the Digital Age
sense of duty to participate in forms such as voting? But what if young people have grown
up under conditions that simply do not produce and reinforce such dispositions? These
children of the new millennium may well come to politics, but through different routes
than their parents and grandparents did. Their brands of civic engagement may seem unfamiliar. Above all, their sense of how to reform creaky political processes may not yet
be imaginable. What may be most important for politicians, educators, and young people
themselves to learn is how to use the media that are now so richly developed for social
and entertainment purposes to build civic and political communities. The lessons involved
here are likely to strain, and ultimately expand, political comprehension within and across
generations. The learning required to encourage the creative involvement of young people
in politics will be the most difﬁcult for those older gatekeepers who continue to live in
different political, social, and media worlds. Yet all of those involved with processes that
affect involvement with public life must be encouraged to learn a few lessons in common.
Researchers play an important part in documenting what those common lessons are and
demonstrating why they matter. In this process of designing research and policy that address
and reconcile the different stories about young citizens, the competing paradigms may be
transcended.
Signs of Political Life in the Digital Age
The future of democracy is in the hands of these young citizens of the so-called digital age.
Many young citizens in more economically prosperous societies already have in their hands
the tools of change: digital media, from laptops, pagers, and cell phones to the convergences
of the next new things. These new media reposition their users in society, making them both
producers and consumers of information. Perhaps more important, they enable rapid formation of large-scale networks that may focus their energies in critical moments, as Rheingold
has discussed in describing what he calls Smart Mobs that used cell phones and pagers and
other digital devices to coordinate decisive protests that sped the fall of corrupt regimes in
the Philippines and elsewhere.22
Sometimes those technologies enable large and more sustained political networks, as in
the formation of Indymedia, a global political information network. Indymedia was created
through the distribution of open source software enabling the production and sharing of
information by young activists under the motto: Be the Media. This network began during the
now iconic Battle of Seattle protests against the World Trade Organization in 1999 as a means
for protesters to communicate among themselves and produce their own news coverage to
counter what they perceived as the ﬁltering of corporate media aligned with the targets of
protest. Other, more issue-speciﬁc networks have emerged via the application of networking
technologies to spark protests such as those that emerged around the world against war in
Iraq on February 12, 2003. Estimated at between thirteen and twenty million participants,
they were the largest coordinated protests in human history. They were organized in a matter
of months through the integrated use of on- and ofﬂine network mobilization.
Digital media also show signs of successful adaptation to the work of conventional politics,
as happened with the American presidential primary campaign of Howard Dean, whose
early followers (many of whom were not so young) organized online networks to share
their perceptions of the candidate. They eventually created unprecedented levels of bottomup communication within the notoriously centralized war room communication model of
election campaigns. However, the growth of semiautonomous supporter networks, with their
Civic Life Online
pressures for some degree of bottom-up steering of the campaign ultimately clashed with the
centralized bureaucracy of the professionally managed campaign. The cautionary tale here
is that the integration of horizontal digital networks with other organizational forms is not
always seamless.
In other cases, applications of digital media do seem to bridge, and at times, transcend the
conventional boundaries between different kinds of political organizations such as parties,
interest groups, and social movements.23 This boundary jumping happened, for example,
when the (mostly) online networking operation MoveOn.org became involved in Democratic Party politics in the United States, acting as a check on the party, and even running its
own commercials. In other conﬁgurations, MoveOn acts more as an interest organization,
mobilizing pressure on speciﬁc issues moving through legislative processes. In other moments, the organization joins many issue constituencies in protest actions as might happen
in a social movement. The attractiveness of these loosely tied organizational forms to young
people has not been lost on many conventional political organizations as they witness the
graying of their conventional membership rosters.24
Despite these and other signs of potential to revive and perhaps reinvent politics among
next generation citizens, two overall trends seem to hold:
The majority of those communicating with young people about conventional politics
continue to do so in tired top-down, highly managed ways that most young people ﬁnd
inauthentic and largely irrelevant.
What young people do online tends to be largely social and entertainment oriented,
with only tangential pathways leading to the conventional civic and political worlds.
These two patterns are most likely related to each other. For example, in order to learn how
to expand youth involvement in aspects of public life pertaining to governance, politicians,
policymakers, and educators need to communicate differently with young citizens. And in
order for young citizens to feel comfortable engaging in more conventional politics, they
need to feel invited to participate on their own terms, and to learn how to use their digital
tools to better express their public voices. This chapter and the book as a whole explore what
young people are doing online, why social and political authorities often misperceive these
activities, and what all parties can learn that might help better integrate young people in all
aspects of politics. Resolving dissonant perceptions of proper citizenship and participation,
while suggesting ways in which digital media may help better connect young people to
public life, may enable future generations to reinvent their democracies.
Where Are They? What Are They Doing?
The news headlines signaled a battle raging between television networks and Nielsen, the
company that provided the audience ratings on which their income depended. In releasing
their fall ratings sweeps for 2005, Nielsen reported a shocking trend. It was so shocking that
the TV networks disputed it, as it seemed to make no sense to them. Moreover, they would
lose huge amounts of ad revenues for their fall programs. The young male demographic was
missing. The much sought after eighteen- to twenty-four-year-old male demographic (only
12 percent of the total audience, yet accounting for $4.1 billion in ad revenues) had dropped
nearly 8 percent from TV viewing the year before, with an even larger drop in prime time.
Every minute less TV watched by this group meant a $77 million loss in revenues across
broadcast and cable. It was a trend that had been developing slowly for a dozen years, but
Changing Citizenship in the Digital Age
suddenly soared to crisis levels for the television industry. Where did the young men go?
It turned out that many of them were still watching TV, but they were more likely to be
playing an Xbox on it. This same demographic group accounted for more than half of video
game sales in a booming multibillion dollar market.25 Creating and interacting with one’s
entertainment programming was just more interesting than watching it passively.
Gamers are joined by even more young people who gravitate to social network environments that change almost as quickly as adults can learn their names: Friendster, Facebook,
MySpace. When media mogul Rupert Murdoch saw the writing on the wall, he hedged
his bets on the television networks that had been aimed at young audiences and bought
MySpace, then the largest recorded social networking site, attracting upwards of sixty million youth. Early on, large online communities also formed around music ﬁle-sharing sites
that indicated the creativity with which young people approached digital media, all because,
as Benkler put it, “a few teenagers and twenty-something-year-olds were able to write software
and protocols.”26 Montgomery in this volume discusses the potential for social communities
such as MySpace to incorporate more central civic aspects, while cautioning that heavily
commercialized online communities may be at odds with public interest content.
A quick visit to any of the social sites suggests that what happens there mainly revolves
around the formation of loosely connected networks dedicated to sharing music, movies,
photos, and, above all, current and prospective friends. In what may be an eternal generational response, many older observers look disapprovingly on all this, seeing these environments as dangerous magnets for sexual predators, and as outlets for young people to indulge
in inappropriate and edgy displays. The dangers of regulating and restricting these sites based
on poor understandings of their importance are explored by Montgomery in Chapter 2. Regulators must proceed with caution in attempting to control the online experiences of young
people. The importance of these networks for forging generational identity and solidarity
cannot be underestimated. Moreover, lurking just beneath the surface is the potential for
vast networks of public voice on contemporary issues. This potential has barely been tapped.
Surprisingly large demonstrations against congressional immigration legislation in the spring
of 2006 spread through organizing networks within MySpace. And, the recognition by the
Dean campaign that supporters were gathering in Meetups quickly moved the Dean network
(which attracted a broad age demographic) past Chihuahua owners and Elvis fans to become
the most populous Meetup. Presidential candidates in 2008 gathered friends in MySpace.
A challenging question is how to better integrate the social and public worlds of young
people online. Unlike classic accounts of civil society in which social bonds strengthened
political participation in the golden age of dutiful citizens,27 the separation of the social and
the civic in the youth online world often seems stark. There are, however, some curious signs
of the integration of politics and social experience within these virtual worlds. For example,
there have been reports of political protest in game environments. World of Warcraft was
disrupted by demonstrations over vaguely deﬁned class issues facing the warriors, resulting
in protesters being banned under game rules established by Blizzard Entertainment, owner
of the game.28 Benkler discusses a “tax revolt” that occurred in Second Life, as players stacked
tea crates around an image of the Washington monument to protest rate increases.29 And,
early on, music ﬁle sharers raised property ownership and copyright issues that eventually
brought legal sanctions, and in many ways changed how ﬁle sharing was regulated and used.
And Earl and Schussman in this volume raise interesting questions about the adaptation of
behaviors from the social movement repertoire by young people pressuring entertainment
corporations about the management and distribution of products.
Civic Life Online
As noted by Lessig and Benkler, among others, the very ways in which people use digital
media present fundamental challenges to established understandings of property, which in
turn, lie at the foundation of the political order.30 For these and other reasons, it is important
to expand our conception of politics and the political, as young people, both wittingly and
unwittingly, push those bounds through their applications of digital technologies. In what
ways are these activities political? Do the communication skills involved transfer to more
conventional areas of politics? Do political and legal responses concerning ownership and
copyright enforcement make for formative early contacts between young people and the
often distant world of power and government? These are among the important questions
that abound in the grey zones of digital life.
Yet for all the tangential incursions of politics into the social and play environments
of digital media, the sphere of more explicitly youth-oriented politics remains comparatively isolated and underdeveloped. Youth sites often seem less social, more moderated, less
open to posting and sharing media content, and more top-down compared to those pertaining to dating, friends, games, music, or video. There are, of course notable exceptions,
including TakingITGlobal, as discussed by Raynes-Goldie and Walker in this volume, along
with examples discussed by Montgomery both here and elsewhere.31 Many questions arise
when contrasting youth politics sites with more social or entertainment sites: How much
trafﬁc do they really get? Can they be sustained in the absence of commercial or equally
restrictive foundation or government subsidies? Are they likely to grow and become connected in large and stable enough networks to stimulate effective political behavior? The
problems and prospects of this youth political Web sphere are central to the chapters by
Xenos and Foot, Montgomery, Coleman, Levine, and Raynes-Goldie and Walker in this
Finding productive answers to the many questions about better integrating the public and
private worlds of youth involves different kinds of learning for different kinds of players:
The politicians and public ofﬁcials who represent the ofﬁcial world of politics to young
people must learn more about their citizenship and communication preferences and
how to engage with them.
The educators and other youth workers who design civic education programs, often
based on unexamined assumptions about what citizenship should be, can beneﬁt from
learning how generational social identities and political preference formation are changing so they can design more engaging civic education models.
The government agencies, foundations, and NGOs that design and operate youth engagement communities online can beneﬁt from learning more about how those sites
may be networked and how they may be opened to partnership with young people who
must see them as authentic if they are to participate in them.
News organizations and other public information producers can learn how to develop
information formats that appeal to the young citizen’s interest in interacting and coproducing digital content and in better integrating the information and action dimensions
of citizenship.
Young people themselves can better learn how to use information and media skills in
ways that give them stronger and more effective public voices.
And academic researchers can learn how to bridge the paradigms in order to better
motivate and inform all of these players.
Changing Citizenship in the Digital Age
Understanding Changing Citizenship across Paradigms
Learning about communities, networks, and civic life can take place at different levels and
in different ways among the groups of key players in youth civic engagement identiﬁed
above: politicians and public ofﬁcials, educators and youth workers, operators of youth
engagement communities, information producers, young people searching for public voice,
and researchers trying to understand how these players can interact more effectively to
promote engagement that is both personally satisfying and mindful of democracy.
A starting point for civic learning among all of these groups is to recognize the shifts in
social and political identity processes resulting from the last several decades of global economic and social change. The story here is a familiar one, so I will keep it short. (The reader
may also want to consult the version offered by David Buckingham in the introduction to
the identity volume in this series.) The collection of nations once known as the industrial
democracies have gone through a period of rapid and, in some cases, wrenching economic
change, with the result that they may now more properly be called postindustrial democracies. Manufacturing is moving to the periphery of economic focus, as design, distribution,
marketing, and management of information have come to the fore. Several results of this
process, among others, include careers have changed from relatively secure life-long bonds
with a single employer and type of work to several different employers and kinds of work;
women have become fully engaged in the work force, changing the organization of family
life; more work and more working parents means less discretionary time and more stress for
most members of families. As a result, the experiences of childhood and transitions to adulthood are different for recent generations. One casualty associated with these changes is that
the group based society that was the foundation of Putnam’s fabled pluralist civic life32 has
transformed into a network society in which individuals seek various kinds of support and
recognition based on different conceptions of membership, identiﬁcation, and commitment.
In the network society, individuals may belong to many loosely tied associational chains
that connect them to their social and occupational worlds. A major consequence of the
uprooting from the broad social inﬂuence of groups is that individuals have become more
responsible for the production and management of their own social and political identities.
Contemporary young people enjoy unprecedented levels of freedom to deﬁne and manage
their self-identities in contrast with earlier generations’ experiences with stronger groups
(denominational church, labor, class, party) that essentially assigned broad social identities to
their members. This transformation of the relationship between individual and society places
increasing strains on parties and governments to appeal to highly personalized political
preferences that are more difﬁcult to address, much less satisfy, than the broad group or
class interests of an earlier era. At the same time, individual citizens—particularly younger
generations who have grown up in this new social and economic matrix—feel that their
personalized expectations of politics are perfectly reasonable (reﬂecting who they are) and
often ﬁnd that politics and politicians either ignore them or are far off the mark in their
communication appeals.
As politicians and parties use marketing techniques to target ever more reﬁned demographics, the democratic result is that ever larger groups of citizens are excluded from the
discourses of elections and policy as they are deemed unnecessary by consultants. Young
citizens are among those most blatantly excluded from the public discourses of government,
policy arenas and elections. The result is that the world of politics and government seems
distant, irrelevant, and inauthentic to many citizens, particularly younger demographics.

The challenge for civic education and engagement here is to begin by recognizing the
profound generational shift in citizenship styles that seems to be occurring to varying degrees
in most of the postindustrial democracies. The core of the shift is that young people are far
less willing to subscribe to the notion held by earlier generations that citizenship is a matter
of duty and obligation. This earlier sense of common commitment to participate at some
level in public affairs was supported, indeed forged, within a group- and class-based civil
society. The underlying sense of citizenship has shifted in societies in which individuals are
more responsible for deﬁning their own identities, using the various tools offered by social
networks and communication media.
In short, there is a broad, cross-national generational shift in the postindustrial democracies from a dutiful citizen model (still adhered to by older generations and many young
people who are positioned in more traditional social settings) to an actualizing citizen model
favoring loosely networked activism to address issues that reﬂect personal values.33 In some
cases, this brand of politics may be tangential to government and conventional political
organization, and may even emerge in parallel cyberspaces such as games. This citizenship
transformation is by no means uniform within societies. Where traditional institutions of
church or labor remain strong, more conventional patterns of civic engagement prevail, and
moral conﬂict may erupt. Other citizens lack the skills and background to engage civic life
at either the group or the individual level, and actively avoid politics altogether.34 However,
two broad patterns do seem to mark a change in citizenship among younger demographics
coming of age in the recent decades of globalization. Table 1 illustrates some of the deﬁning
qualities of this shift in citizenship styles.
Bridging the Paradigms: Six Learning Scenarios
The tendency to either explicitly or implicitly anchor political opportunities and offerings to
young people in one conception of citizenship or the other helps to explain the rise of the two
paradigms of youth engagement discussed earlier. Those paradigms support our dissonant
public conversation about whether young people are engaged or disengaged. Given their
value premises and empirical references, the paradigms are (by deﬁnition) both right, but
they are also equally responsible for confounding much of our theoretical, empirical and
practical approaches to youth engagement in the digital age.
Changing Citizenship in the Digital Age
Trying to keep both the actualizing citizen (AC) and dutiful citizen (DC) clusters of citizenship qualities in mind when we discuss learning goals for different players may help bridge
the paradigms, while helping all of the players in the civic engagement process think about
youth engagement in a more holistic way. In other words, recognizing the shift in emphasis
from DC to AC citizenship among younger citizens, and then deciding how to accommodate
both dimensions of citizenship in theory and practice may have important implications for
what the various players in citizenship production can (and, dare I say, should?) learn about
youth civic engagement in the digital age.
What Can Politicians and Government Ofﬁcials Learn?
Politicians often appear to be faking it in the eyes of young citizens, who are ﬁnely tuned to
media performances. Indeed, there is reason to think that some of the popularity of reality
TV shows over news and other political fare may have something to do with the blatantly
staged and marketed aspects of politics. By contrast, reality programs often involve young
people in emotionally resonant situations.35 Not only is the heavily marketed and staged
nature of politics off-putting but the even deeper problem is that much formal political
communication seems to ignore young people, as discussed in the chapter by Xenos and
Foot in this book. Young voters are generally regarded by consultants as a poor investment
of communication budgets because they tend not to vote, and they are hard to reach through
common media channels (recall the earlier discussion of the lost demographic). The result is
that there has developed a political culture in many nations in which young people are not
asked to participate, and, when they are asked, the language and issues are not convincingly
presented. An exceptional case here proves the rule: the 2004 presidential election in the
United States witnessed one of the largest mobilization efforts ever aimed at young voters,
and turnout in the difﬁcult eighteen- to twenty-four-year-old bracket was up dramatically
over previous elections.
The deeper implication of a political culture in which rituals and discourse are managed
increasingly by professional communications consultants is that the importance of broad
and inclusive communication for democracy has all but been pushed aside.36 A case in
point involves an address I gave to a convention of international political consultants. The
time was just at the turn of the millennium, when digital media strategies were becoming
recognized as useful means of targeting hard to reach demographics. I spoke about the
growing fragmentation of societies and the resulting democratic dilemma of communication
strategies that exclude particular demographic groups, most notably young people. During
the question period following the talk, the ﬁrst person to stand was one of the founders of
professional political communication consulting going back several decades. He remarked
that most of what I said about targeting and exclusion was true but that I had missed a
crucial point: the obligation of hired consultants was not to promote democracy but to get
the client elected, or win the client’s policy battles.
Governments that continue to exclude future citizens through their communication strategies only perpetuate the divided sense of citizen identity that leads young people to ﬁnd
political outlets outside government. Given the low costs and potentially broad reach of
digital media, there is much that could be done to improve the daily communication outreach of politicians. As Foot and Xenos observe in this book, the design of campaign Web
sites and the presentation of issues on them could be much more tuned to take advantage
of the interactivity, networking capacity, and other affordances of digital media that young
people experience in social networking sites, blogs and games. The ultimate dilemma, as
Civic Life Online
noted earlier, is the reluctance to yield some degree of control over political communication
content to the audience. The top-down, one-way model of communication was much more
in tune with the DC citizenship style. It simply does not work with AC citizens. This is the
central point of Coleman’s concluding chapter.
In addition, public ofﬁcials must move beyond the posturing that brands youth social sites
as magnets for predators, and showcases for other undesirable behaviors. Such positions may
make news, but they stigmatize young people and undermine the authenticity of the places
where they gather online. As Montgomery notes in the next chapter, a more productive
policy concern is to ensure what has become known as “net neutrality.” The very future
of public information traveling over digital networks is threatened if service providers can
impose restrictions on categories of noncommercial content.
What Can Educators, Policymakers, and Community Youth Workers Learn?
The groups that may be both the most important and the most out of touch with the
shifting citizen identity patterns of youth are educators and education policymakers. Most
of those who preside over curriculum decisions and policies continue to be older-generation
DC citizens who assume that their model of citizenship needs to be acquired by future
generations. Added to this common misperception are the intense political battles over
the moral and political content of school curricula of recent years. The politicization of
education on many fronts reinforces a conservative and actively off-putting approach to civic
education found in many and perhaps most public schools, particularly in America. Indeed,
it is probably not too big a stretch to propose that the majority of school civics experiences
for those coming of age in contemporary society fall into one of two categories: (1) little or no
civics content or (2) courses that stick to academic coverage of basic government functions
and present unappealing perspectives on the subject. Most courses in public schools are
thoroughly cleansed of the kinds of political issues and active learning experiences that
young people might ﬁnd authentic and motivating.
Consider some evidence for these generalizations.37 A study of the top three high school
civics texts indicated that they contained references to few political issues. Moreover, protest
politics was presented as an historical throwback to days before people won their civil rights.
And government was idealized in terms of its representative and responsive capacities.38 One
could not design an experience less likely to be believed, and less likely to engage with the
preferences of AC citizens for personal contact with important issues and shared peer-to-peer
communication about them.
The alternative to such ideologically rigid DC education appears to be no civics education at all. It is noteworthy that No Child Left Behind has left citizenship standards far
behind math and reading in the priorities of schools. Many school systems have no standards for civic knowledge, much less, guidelines for the acquisition of citizen skills that
might aid participation later in life. This trend has developed over the last several decades.
A Carnegie/CIRCLE report on the Civic Mission of the Schools noted that in 1949, a course
called “problems of democracy” appeared on 41.5 percent of high school transcripts. Students in those courses typically learned about government by discussing contemporary
issues, often supplemented by newspaper reading assignments. That course appeared on
fewer than 9 percent of transcripts by the early 1970s, and has by now almost completely
disappeared.39
Another telling sign of educational policy neglect and misdirection is that the principal
national assessment guide for civics (National Assessment of Educational Progress) almost
Changing Citizenship in the Digital Age
exclusively measures historical and constitutional knowledge. There is little or no attention
to student civic orientations, engagement levels, or skills that might enable the discussion
of real political issues. As Peter Levine has noted, the predominant approach of government
civic education policy and funding is to avoid controversy, active student engagement, and
even voter registration.40
This proﬁle of contemporary civic education is bleak, particularly in light of the information and communication opportunities afforded by digital media technologies that are
already familiar to most young people. In many cases, it is unclear whether having no curriculum is better or worse than having one that actively clashes with young people’s sense
of political reality and meaningful personal expression. There are, of course notable exceptions to these trends, and many foundations and progressive educators are experimenting
with creative alternatives. The chapters in this volume by Bers and Rheingold illuminate the
kinds of interactive, communication-driven curricula that might better engage the political
identities of young citizens.
There is need for caution and considerable creativity in thinking about implementing
more creative approaches to engage young people in communication with each other about
real political concerns. For example, a civic education project that I operated in Seattle
aimed to offer young people direct experiences with issues in their communities.41 The idea
was to combine community issue surveys and face-to-face meetings with policy ofﬁcials,
while introducing students to communication skills such as classroom deliberation, all in
the context of an information rich online news environment. Students were also invited to
participate in chats and to design other networked communication applications to develop
a public voice about their newly deﬁned issues. It soon became apparent that the more
progressive private schools were already doing much of this in one way or another, and
most of their students even had their own laptops. At the other extreme, the poorest of
the public schools presented infrastructure obstacles for even getting a single computer in
some classrooms. In addition, many teachers faced pressures to teach conservatively from
textbooks, due to the lack of time and resources needed to fashion community projects for
their classes. In settings less progressive than Seattle (and, not infrequently, even there),
teachers also face added pressures from parents who are suspicious of bringing many public
issues into the schools. To top it off, students in the lowest achieving schools typically had
the strongest antipathy toward politics and government, many having experienced them
only in negative ways involving law and social service encounters. Yet the at-risk students
and their teachers who managed to navigate these obstacles typically produced some of the
most powerful projects proposing actions to address their community issues. These students
developed impressive public voices using a variety of digital media, from interactive Web
sites to streamed video public affairs programming.
In subsequent years I have followed the Student Voices project as it has been put on
self-sustaining footing in the schools. What seems to stick for all but the most dedicated
teachers are the free curriculum downloads. The core community project and peer-to-peer
communication experiences have withered due to lack of time, technology resources, and
other support. The encouraging lesson from this project is that it is possible to engage
even the most challenging at-risk populations, and raise civic skill levels. The discouraging
lesson is that the obstacles facing those populations and their schools often prove hard to
The lesson of formal civic education is often that the civically rich get richer and the
poor become discouraged. These realities make the kinds of civic communication skill sets
Civic Life Online
recommended by Rheingold in this volume seem ﬂexible and relatively low-cost additions
to current educational approaches. They also make it wise to attend to the cautionary notes
sounded by Levine. Even if young people are given the skills and resources to build networks
for themselves, there is the important question of “if they build it, will they come?” Levine
discusses the potential for discouragement among young people who develop blogs and
other networking technologies only to discover that they receive little reaction from the
outer world. At the same time, this possibility must be weighed against the distributed and
hyperlinked properties of digital networks that Benkler regards as keeping even potentially
isolated nodes in easy range of activation and inclusion. The capacity for broad linking of
content gives even obscure sites the potential to reach large numbers of people and to jump
media strata, sometimes, even pushing content from the personal level to large audience
media. Still, we need to learn how to help the majority of solitary young bloggers and
content producers join their voices more effectively with others.
What Can Operators of Youth Engagement Networks Learn?
An early survey of youth electoral engagement sites in the United States found that the often
well-intentioned operations funded by foundations and other public interest organizations
suffered several notable digital deﬁcits: the sites tended to be sticky rather than encouraging
networking, the kinds of interactive affordances lagged far behind what was then available
outside the political media sphere, and perhaps most notably, there was a disconnection
between the often vibrant youth sites and the election candidate and campaign sites that lay
disturbingly out of reach.42 Some of these problems have been remedied, as demonstrated in
the far greater networking among youth sites in recent elections. However, the curious disconnect between the youth engagement sphere and the sphere of elections and government
remains a stubborn problem. In part, the problem is due to the earlier mentioned combination of neglect and misapprehension of young people and their communication preferences
by politicians and government. Perhaps until politicians and governments ﬁnd ways to communicate a politics that seems authentic and inviting to young citizens these disconnections
will persist.
These concerns aside, there is a growing and, in many ways, thriving collection of youth political engagement opportunities online. Montgomery and her colleagues have documented
the evolution of many of these sites and networks here and elsewhere.43 However, there
are important issues that remain to be addressed so that those who design and operate the
youth engagement sphere may better learn what works and what doesn’t. To begin with,
there remains an often alarming gap between government and foundation operations and
youth-built networks in terms of the communication affordances, the content, and the degree of control offered to youth. This is the focus of Coleman’s chapter in this volume. The
key seems to be recognizing the changed citizenship styles of young people, and their growing preference for relatively nonhierarchical networks that enable free exploration of ideas.
Government and foundation sponsored sites are often reluctant to allow young visitors to
deﬁne and expand the bounds of politics.
When success models for youth civic networks are identiﬁed, they need to be studied and
shared. This book includes a detailed look at one of the largest and most successful youth
civic networking and communication operations, TakingITGlobal. In their chapter Raynes-
Goldie and Walker discuss various youth engagement sites in contrast to social sites such
as MySpace, and discuss issues of sustainability, growth, mission, and limits on control and
content in a successful youth engagement network.
Changing Citizenship in the Digital Age
What Can News Organizations and Information Producers Learn?
Surely one place to begin reconnecting AC citizens to government is rethinking the learning
process surrounding the uses of political information. In this digital society, the axiom
that information is power is more appropriate than ever. Yet, given prevailing AC attitudes
about conventional dutiful citizen politics, it is not surprising that there is correspondingly
little interest among young citizens in following current issues and events in the news—at
least as the news is typically constructed and presented. Most young people simply do not
believe that following and learning about various issues will translate into the power to help
decide them. Strong (daily) levels of interest in politics are expressed by barely 13 percent
of eighteen- to twenty-four-year-olds, compared to more than twice that level among those
over ﬁfty-ﬁve. Interest levels in the news reﬂect interest levels in politics.44 Only 17 percent
of eighteen- to twenty-four-year-old women say they follow what is going on in government
and public affairs most of the time, compared to nearly half of women over ﬁfty.45 Twentyeight percent of men in the younger demographic bracket claim to follow political news,
but more than 60 percent of men over ﬁfty say they actively follow politics. The important
point here is not just that there is a generation gap in connecting to conventional politics
but also that it has grown steadily over the past several decades.46 Young people are more
tuned out than were their corresponding peers at any point in the last half century. Even
in political systems with strong commitments to high quality public service radio and TV
news, and cultures of strong adult engagement, the arrival of commercial television—with its
cheap news formulas of mayhem, scandal, and crime—quickly drew young audiences. And
those young commercial news viewers put politics and government affairs near the bottom
of their attention ladders, well below crime, accidents, sports, and weather.47
Part of the problem here is surely that conventional news is designed for DC citizens. At its
best, it is generally information rich, but also ﬁlled with the views of ofﬁcials and government
authorities, and it generally lacks much in the way of citizen voices or action ideas. The DC
citizen is the “informed citizen,” an ideal that dates from the progressive model of objective
reporting and informed citizenship that emerged in the United States nearly a century ago.48
The informed citizen is supposed to take abstract, impartial information and then decide
how to apply it. This model simply doesn’t work for AC citizens. They are skeptical of ofﬁcial
versions of events. They prefer to help assemble and deliberate about information. And above
all, they seek information that is attached to values and activities they know and trust. The
AC citizen is more inclined to seek integrated information that comes with action options,
and to participate in the evaluation of information on which decisions about action are
There are many lessons to be learned about how to create news and information for AC
citizens, and they tend to begin with involving the audience in the information process
itself. Part of the solution is to make information interactive, and to involve the audience
in the rating, editing, evaluation, and commentary processes. There are models from the
early days of Internet news suggesting that this can be done effectively within narrow communities of interest and among activist networks: Slashdot uses a collective editorial and
rating technology that produces high-quality information as viewed by its audience; Plastic
pioneered a blog-driven news format; and Indymedia introduced an audience-produced, but
generally unedited, news-commentary-action format. Many experiments now exist with collective editing and quality control involving the audience in the information production
process. Many of these information experiments raise issues of credibility that are explored
in the volume edited by Metzger and Flanagin on that subject in this series.
Civic Life Online
The paramount issue in assessing the credibility of more engaging news formats should
not be to compare them to the current DC standard of balanced, politically neutral, “objective” news that is disconnected from action opportunities. That standard, like the style of
citizenship on which it is based, is fading. News of the future is more likely to follow the logic
of the BBC experiment ICan, which anchors the news in civic networks organized around
issues as deﬁned by news audiences themselves.49 The resources of the news organization
in this model are aimed at helping citizens organize effectively on issues they care about.
Perhaps much of the news agenda of the future will be driven by such audience afﬁnity
networks. On the downside, the BBC project tends to be aimed at connecting citizens to
government, and it is not particularly well suited to the more diffuse kinds of activities that
may cluster in AC politics. Moreover, there is little speciﬁc communication with younger
citizens on their own terms, making it unclear whether such information formats can help
young people engage effectively with conventional political processes. Perhaps the ultimate
question in this chain of possibilities is whether those who hold power in government and
business will be receptive to sharing power when younger citizens eventually challenge it, as
they probably will.
What Can Young People Learn?
A theme running through many of the chapters in this volume is that young people can
better learn how to transfer skills they are already using in other online experiences to
more conventional arenas of politics. They can also be encouraged to acquire additional
skills that actively enable the formation of public voice both in their social networks and
in more explicitly political contexts. Given even minimal learning opportunities, the core
AC citizenship concerns seem strong enough among enough young people to motivate
the continued creation and growth of impressive youth engagement networks focused on
issues such as environment, global justice, and human rights. The connections to conventional politics and government, however, may continue to be thin. The embrace of the
traditional core of politics—elections and interest representation in policy processes—may
not come easily for generations with such deep skepticism toward politicians and parties.
It might help if those offering DC approaches to civic education, community participation, or news more often included protest, governmental reform, and activism as legitimate
considerations.
Young people may be right in sensing that politics in nations such as the United States is
an insider game requiring money and connections, and, thus, not for them. However, the
opportunities to apply considerable political pressure for reforms are now available through
digital media networks. Perhaps those networks can be dedicated to the task of political
reform. The next social movement may well launch demonstrations from desktops and
cellular phones. It may write its own news and gain large audiences for it. Indeed, early
efforts to mobilize large-scale protests targeting particular governmental actions (war, media
deregulation, and immigration reform) have shown the power of networks in action. The
question is whether generations as distant from government as recent ones will ﬁnd the
time, energy or relevance to reform the system.
What Can Scholars Learn?
Many scholars have discovered a shift in value patterns in postindustrial democracies in
which people (particularly younger citizens) are more inclined to become interested in
personally meaningful, lifestyle-related political issues, rather than party or ideological
Changing Citizenship in the Digital Age
programs. These AC citizens seek public commitments and issues that ﬁt with the values
at the center of personal lifestyles, giving rise to sharp trends in consumer politics, for
example.50 Not surprisingly, scholars and researchers who tend to focus on more personally
expressive aspects of youth politics tend to resonate with the engaged youth paradigm. Meanwhile, scholars who continue to emphasize the importance of various government-centered
activities such as voting and following public affairs tend to embrace the disengaged citizen
paradigm, even as they may recognize the rise of alternative forms of political action among
young people.
What is needed is research that combines principles underlying both citizenship styles.
That is, research aimed at identifying and assessing strategies of engagement that appeal to
AC citizens while creating connections to government that help promote DC democratic
ideals. Research that leans too heavily on one side or another of the citizenship divide will
only contribute to sustaining the paradigm conﬂicts that cloud our understanding of civic
engagement.
Conclusion: Two Scenarios of Youth Engagement
Depending on how the above learning scenarios play out, there are several different scenarios
for future youth engagement. It is important to understand that these developments need
not be left to their own evolution or devolution. In the process of synthesizing what we
know about youth engagement we—academics, educators, educational policymakers, NGOs,
journalists, foundations, public ofﬁcials, and young people—can make choices about what
outcomes are desirable and how to nurture them.
If nothing is done to bridge the paradigms, the default scenario will likely be persistent
youth disconnection from conventional politics, with little reconciliation of the gap between
AC and DC citizenship styles, and continuing unproductive paradigm battles in the academic
world. The ﬂip side of this scenario is the continued growth of youth (AC) politics “by
other means”: political consumerism, pressures on entertainment product ownership and
distribution, and issue networks spanning local and global concerns. This scenario will do
little to bring young citizens meaningfully back to government, and it will continue to
provoke unproductive debates about engagement and disengagement that talk past each
other in academia, education, foundations, and government policy circles.
A second scenario utilizes the possibilities for convergence of technologies and political
practices to bring vibrant experiences of politics into classrooms, youth programs, and yes,
even elections, showing young people how their concerns can gain public voice within the
conventional arenas of power and decision making. This scenario requires more creative
research paradigms that combine AC and DC citizen qualities into realistic scenarios for
engagement that can be implemented and assessed.
The most important question before us is: What kind of democratic experiences would we
choose for future generations? This is a properly political question, yet it is one that often
chills creativity among government ofﬁcials, educators, and NGOs—the very players with
the capacity to make a difference in the political futures of young people. The outcomes
for youth engagement, insofar as they involve the restoration of positive engagement with
government alongside creative and expressive personal communication, depend importantly
on the adults who shape the early political impressions of young people. Are politicians,
parents, educators, policymakers, and curriculum developers willing to allow young citizens
to more fully explore, experience, and expand democracy, or will they continue to force
them to just read all about it?

Youth and Digital Democracy: Intersections of Practice, Policy,
and the Marketplace
Kathryn C. Montgomery
American University, School of Communication
Since the advent of the World Wide Web in the early nineties, the so-called Digital Generation has been at the epicenter of major tectonic shifts that are transforming the media
landscape. The more than 70 million individuals born in the United States during the last
two decades of the twentieth century represent the largest cohort of young people in the
nation’s history, and the ﬁrst to grow up in a world saturated with networks of information, digital devices, and the promise of perpetual connectivity. Youth are in many ways
the deﬁning users of the new media. As active creators of a new digital culture, they are
developing their own Web sites, diaries, and blogs; launching their own online enterprises;
and forging a new set of cultural practices.1 A study by Forrester Research found that youth
incorporate digital media into their lives at a faster rate than any other generation. “All generations adopt devices and Internet technologies, but younger consumers are Net natives,”
one of the report’s coauthors explained to the press. They don’t just go online; they “live
Foundations, music industry celebrities, corporations, and wealthy donors in the United
States have poured large sums of money into a variety of initiatives aimed at using digital
media to reach and engage young people in civic and political activities. These ventures are
based on the hope that new technologies may be able to help reverse the long-term declines
in civic and political participation among youth.3 Experts such as Michael X. Delli Carpini,
Dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, have
expressed some cautious optimism. Commenting on some of the early Web-based efforts, he
has identiﬁed several important Internet features that lend themselves to enhanced engagement. These include increased speed with which information can be gathered and transmitted, greater volume of information that is easily accessible, more ﬂexibility in how and when
information is accessed, and much greater opportunity to interact with others in a range
of contexts (one to one, one to many, many to one, and many to many), using a variety
of media types (text, audio, and video). As a result, Delli Carpini notes, the Internet both
shifts the nature of community from geographic to interest-based and challenges traditional
deﬁnitions of information gatekeepers and authoritative voices, of content producers and
consumers. He suggests, however, that Internet-based initiatives are likely to be more useful
in expanding the activities of youth already engaged in civic life, rather than encouraging
those who do not participate to become involved.4
The growth and penetration of broadband and the development and distribution of
new software applications—such as social networking platforms, blogging tools, and
podcasting—have combined to create the next generation of the Internet, often called
Civic Life Online
“Web 2.0.”5 As legal scholar Yochai Benkler argues in The Wealth of Networks: How Social
Production Transforms Markets and Freedom, these innovations have enhanced the participatory capabilities of digital media, building on the core features of the Internet to create a new
media environment that, by its very nature, is a democratizing force. “We are witnessing a
fundamental change in how individuals can interact with their democracy and experience
their role as citizens,” Benkler explains. “They are no longer constrained to occupy the role
of mere readers, viewers, and listeners. They can be, instead, participants in a conversation.”
Because digital media “shift the locus of content creation from the few professional journalists trolling society for issues and observations, to the people who make up society,” the
public agenda
can be rooted in the life and experience of individual participants in society – in their observations,
experiences, and obsessions. The network allows all citizens to change their relationship to the public
sphere. They no longer need to be consumers and passive spectators. They can become creators and
primary subjects. It is in this sense that the Internet democratizes.6
Digital Communication at the Crossroads
If Benkler’s assessment is correct, then the Digital Generation should be among the key beneﬁciaries of this new democratizing media system. But as with earlier media technologies,
the fulﬁllment of this democratic potential will be determined not only by technological advances but also by political and economic forces. As a public medium, the Internet is really
only a little more than a decade old. Its dramatic growth during that period parallels the
rapid penetration of television a half century ago. Like television, the Internet has brought
about enormous societal changes, many of which we are just beginning to understand. But
this new medium is by no means static. The Internet as we know it is undergoing a fundamental transformation. In the United States, the major telephone and cable companies have
gained control of 98 percent of residential broadband service. These companies have been
engaged in a high-stakes competitive battle over the control of an array of services delivered
through digital pathways on a variety of platforms, including computers, digital television,
and wireless devices. Mergers and acquisitions in the telecommunication business (e.g., between AT&T and BellSouth, Verizon and MCI) have all been predicated on expectations for
explosive growth in the broadband market.7 As the Internet continues to make its transition
into the broadband era, some of its fundamental deﬁning features that have been taken for
granted by users will evolve and change.
The emergence of broadband is fueling a new boom in the digital marketplace, with advertising and marketing at its core. Because of the exponential rise in children’s spending power
during the last several decades of the twentieth century, the Internet emerged as a new mass
medium in the midst of a youth media culture that was already highly commercialized.8
Interactive technologies have created capabilities that alter the media marketing paradigm
in signiﬁcant ways, extending some of the practices that have already been put in place
in conventional media but, more important, deﬁning a new set of relationships between
young people and corporations. As a consequence, marketing and advertising have become
a pervasive presence in youth digital culture, creating new hybrid forms that blend communications, content, and commerce.9 Market forces are playing a central role in shaping both
the online political youth sphere and the new participatory platforms that have come to
deﬁne Web 2.0.
Youth and Digital Democracy
A constellation of interrelated public policy issues will also play a critical role in determining the nature of the emerging digital media environment. Many of these issues have been
inserted into deliberations over revisions of the U.S. telecommunications laws, replaying
some of the earlier debates of the nineties. Some have been thrust into the media spotlight,
the topic of intense debate that is too often polarized, simplistic, and narrow. Others have
been argued primarily in closed-door sessions at the ofﬁces of K Street lobbyists, before the
Federal Communications Commission, or on Capitol Hill. Discussion of these complex and
arcane policies has largely been conﬁned to business and trade reporting, with virtually no
consideration of their impact on civic and political discourse. Several scholars, including
Benkler, have written persuasively about the importance of these policies to the future of the
democratic media.10 A few issues have generated considerable online discussion and debate
in the blogosphere.
All of these developments will have far-reaching impacts on the nature and extent of
civic and political discourse in the new digital media culture, not only for youth but also
for the public at large. In the following pages, I will explore the promises and perils of the
new digital media as a vehicle for renewed youth engagement in public life. First, I will
brieﬂy summarize the ﬁndings of a study I coauthored in 2004 that examined the emergence
of Web sites designed to foster youth civic and political engagement. Second, I will show
how innovations in participatory technology were incorporated into the massive youth
vote efforts of the 2004 election. Third, I will discuss some of those same get-out-the-vote
initiatives to illustrate the ways in which commercial forces have become a pervasive presence
in the new civic and political spaces for young people in the digital media. Fourth, I will
outline ﬁve of the key policy issues whose outcome will signiﬁcantly impact the participatory
potential of the next generation of digital media. Finally, I will offer several recommendations
for policy, research, and public education efforts that could help maximize the democratic
capacities of the new digital media.
The Youth Civic Web
Beginning in the late nineties, a number of nonproﬁts began launching Web sites designed
with the explicit purpose of engaging adolescents and young adults in civic and political
life. A study completed in 2004 by myself and a team of researchers at American University surveyed more than three hundred Web sites created by and for young people.11 The
Web sites reﬂected a diversity of goals and constituencies. Some were aimed at a broad
youth audience, while others were tailored to more speciﬁc communities, such as underserved youth, youth in urban or rural areas, and youth of various racial, ethnic, or sexual
identities. Although most were rooted in preexisting organizations and institutions, a few
were solely creatures of the digital universe. And while many of the Web sites were little
more than static “brochureware,” the study also found numerous examples of innovative
uses of the interactive digital technologies for a variety of civic and political purposes. A
brief look at a handful of the sites in the study shows a richness and variety of content and
The Community Information Corps ( of St. Paul, Minnesota,
enlists teens to develop an “online tour” of public art in St. Paul’s West Side, including clickable photos of the individual murals, many of which reﬂect the neighborhood’s immigrant
roots, from its large Mexican American community to its more recent Hmong arrivals.
Civic Life Online
WireTap ( an online magazine created by the progressive organization AlterNet refers to itself as “youth in pursuit of the dirty truth.” WireTap serves
up youth-written reporting, analysis, and cultural reviews on a wide range of contemporary
issues, from the job market for young people, to politicians’ attitudes toward youth, to the
importance of hip-hop music in youth culture.
Tolerance.org ( a Web project of the Southern Poverty Law Center, offers young people information and skills for promoting tolerance and ﬁghting hate,
arranging its content according to age level, with separate sections for parents, teachers,
teenagers, and children. “Mix It Up,” the teen section, promotes an activist approach to
ﬁghting self-segregation and “social boundaries” in schools, whether based on race, religion,
or school-based cliques.
Out Proud ( the Web site of the National Coalition for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, & Transgender Youth, is rich in resources designed to assist youth in coming
to terms with their sexuality. Most notable of these is “Outpath” ( 
a searchable archive with hundreds of personal narratives about coming out, which includes
an opportunity for visitors, both youth and their families, to add their own stories to the
collection.
TakingITGlobal ( features a set of interrelated online projects
that offer young people connections, resources, and opportunities for international dialogue
with their peers. Among the site’s many features are: message boards, an internal instant
messaging system, live moderated chats, and the ability for members to create their own
online groups.
Free the Planet! ( provides resources for activists and helps
students win campaigns for environmental protection. The group has taken aim at such corporate giants as Ford Motors and Kraft Foods, among others. In each case the Web site offers
a “problem,” a “solution,” and “what you can do”—from sending an email to a corporate or
political decision maker to urging colleges to opt for integrated pest management instead of
heavy pesticide use.12
Though fragmented and not always in the foreground of the emerging media culture,
these online ventures are nonetheless a noteworthy development, suggesting the beginnings
of an emerging genre on the Internet that could be loosely called “youth civic culture.”
While the study did not assess the impact of these online civic ventures on young people’s
attitudes or behaviors, it did identify numerous opportunities for youth to acquire some of
the key attributes of civic engagement.13 Civic Web sites offered a variety of tools for youth
expression and communication, including online polls and questionnaires; invitations to
submit essays, poetry, artwork, and other original materials; and discussion boards that
encouraged collaboration and debate. Speciﬁc populations, including racial, ethnic, and
gender groups, could take advantage of the Web to strengthen their identities, and to build
knowledge, pride, and a sense of belonging through a network of contacts and resources.
Civic sites also provided youth with the opportunity to hone such important civic skills as
fundraising, volunteering, and communicating with political leaders.14
Most of these youth civic Web sites were launched with an “if we build it, they will
come” strategy, and many of them have struggled for visibility and inﬂuence in a highly
seductive and engaging online youth media environment.15 The growth of participatory
online platforms has, in many ways, eclipsed some of the early Web-based efforts for engaging
Youth and Digital Democracy
youth. The popularity of YouTube, MySpace, and other user-generated content sites suggests
that the emerging digital media culture is expanding the opportunities for young people
to connect, engage, and create; and large numbers of them are taking advantage of these
new outlets. “Young internet users—especially those with broadband at home—are the most
likely contributors of content to cyberspace,” noted a 2006 report by the Pew Internet &
American Life Project. More than half of bloggers are under the age of thirty, and these
young people are also “among the most enthusiastic communicators of the modern age,
taking advantage of every opportunity to communicate.”16 While the Pew report found
that the majority of bloggers view their online communication as vehicles for personal
expression rather than civic discourse, there are also clear indications that many youth are
using these tools to participate in public conversations. Some have joined the ranks of “citizen
journalists.”17 For example, Guerrilla News Network, an online youth media site, offers
members a complete toolbox of participatory software through its “GNN 2.0,” encouraging
young people to “create and disseminate news themselves, through blogs, headlines, original
articles, videos, photos, our own customized personal e-mail newsletters and collaborative,
ongoing investigations that will allow GNNers to work together to cover important stories
the mainstream media is missing.”18 (In another chapter of this volume, Kate Raynes-Goldie
and Luke Walker document a variety of ways in which young people are using Web 2.0 to
engage in debate and activism.)
Rocking the Vote—Digital Style
Digital software and technology were a central part of many of the orchestrated efforts to
promote youth voting during the 2004 presidential election. While the Internet had already
begun to play an increasingly prominent role in campaign politics, 2004 marked the ﬁrst
truly high-tech election. Researchers at George Washington University documented a new
category of Internet users, which they labeled “Online Political Citizens.” Though not exclusively youth, this cohort of Internet-savvy political participants included a signiﬁcant number of young people, with 36 percent of them between the ages of eighteen and thirty-four,
compared to 24 percent of the general public. A large majority of them (44 percent) had not
been politically involved before and had never “worked for a campaign, made a campaign
donation or attended a campaign event,” the study noted. “They visit campaign Web sites,
donate money online, join Internet discussion groups, and read and post comments on Web
logs.” They also “organize local events through Web sites such as Meetup.com or donate
money to their causes on sites such as MoveOn.org or Grassﬁre.org.” They “use campaign
Web sites as hubs” and “depend heavily on e-mail to stay in touch with the campaigns,
receive news stories and muster support.”19 The successful primary campaign of Vermont
presidential candidate Howard Dean, which introduced many of these online practices into
the election cycle—with extensive involvement of young people—was hailed as a harbinger
of a new era in digital politics.20 But as Michael Xenos and Kirsten Foot point out in the next
chapter in this volume, most of the candidates in the 2004 election failed to make full use
of digital technologies to effectively engage youth, creating a “generation gap” between the
needs and expectations of young people and the practices of political actors.21
In contrast to this pattern, the dozens of nonpartisan get-out-the-vote campaigns targeted
at youth showcased a multiplicity of strategies and tactics for using digital media as a tool
for political mobilization. Foundations and individual donors invested large sums of money
to fund a variety of efforts aimed at various segments of the youth population.22 Some had

colorful and provocative names, such as Smack Down Your Vote and the League of Pissed Off
Voters. Others reﬂected a diversity of constituencies and approaches. The Hip Hop Summit
Action Network (HSAN), launched in 2001 by rap music mogul Russell Simmons, orchestrated
a series of events headlined by hip-hop musicians and aimed at urban and Hispanic youth.23
Rap star Sean “P. Diddy” Combs formed Citizen Change, with a compelling slogan that
reﬂected the high-stakes nature of the upcoming election: Vote or Die! L.A.-based Voces
del Pueblo (voices of the people) targeted Latino youth “who are most likely to opt out of
participating in the electoral process.”24 The Black Youth Vote project partnered with BET
for a black college tour, with a budget of $5 million.25 The Youth Vote Coalition brought in
$660,000 for the election cycle, amassing a coalition of 106 national groups.26
The Internet played a critical role in all these efforts, not only providing each initiative with
a direct means for reaching its target audience but also facilitating collaboration among the
groups, forging virtual coalitions through links and cross-promotion strategies, and creating
a “youth engagement Web sphere” on the Internet that was far larger and more sophisticated
than any before.27 This online ﬂuidity enabled visitors to travel across Web sites quickly and
effortlessly, gathering information, communicating with others, and joining whatever effort
matched their interests and passions.
One of the leading groups was Rock the Vote. Founded by the music industry in 1990, the
nonproﬁt had been a pioneer of the youth vote movement for more than a decade. It played
a central role in the deployment of digital tools for engaging youth voters during the 2004
election cycle, combining a range of cutting-edge practices and forging new ones. Thus, its
campaign can be viewed as a compendium of state-of-the-art strategies that were replicated
by other groups and that created a framework for future efforts.
Rock the Vote’s Web site served as the hub of this maelstrom of preelection activity,
linking with the growing number of youth vote initiatives in a synergistic network of online
relationships.28 A “Register to Vote” tab linked to a pop-up window with a voter registration
form that visitors could print and mail to their state elections ofﬁce, under the slogan
“Fill it and print it, lick it and mail it.”29 By registering online, members could join Rock
the Vote’s “Street Team,” connecting with others in their communities to become part of
the army of volunteers who were registering new voters at concerts, clubs, and campuses
across the country.30 Donations could be made easily with a click of the mouse.31 Youth
could also participate in the RTV blog, to learn “what Capitol Hill is saying and ﬁnd young
people’s response.”32 The nonproﬁt went to elaborate means to spread the Rock the Vote
brand throughout the Web, including free downloads of RTV banners and radio ads, as well
as links to its voter registration page. Groups and individuals could also import the Rock
the Vote online voter registration tool and brand it for their own Web sites.33 Rock the
Vote forged a partnership with MySpace.com, using the site’s social networking platform
to encourage members to spread the message among their peers and employing the latest
MP3s, photos, and buddy icons “to inspire, organize and mobilize young people to vote.”34
Other youth vote campaigns developed their own innovative digital strategies. For example, MoveOnStudentAction.org, a youth initiative started by the online group MoveOn.org,
created a “Voter Multiplier” page on its Web site, inviting members to upload their friends’
names and e-mail addresses—from their Palm, Outlook, or Facebook programs—in order to
create their own “personal precincts.” With a few strokes of a key, each individual could
instantly contact hundreds of friends, e-mailing them personalized messages—from “virtual
door hangers” to online voter registration links to election-day reminders to cast their ballot,
along with directions to the right polling place.35 James Hong and Jim Young, creators of
Youth and Digital Democracy
the successful online dating site, HotOrNot, launched VoteOrNot. The venture was based
on the same principle that friends could do a much better job of inﬂuencing each other
than could impersonal advertising messages. To attract people to the site, the sponsors offered a $200,000 sweepstakes that would be split between the winner and the person who
had referred him or her to the site. Members who joined VoteOrNot would be linked to
another Web site where they could register to vote. Launched over Labor Day weekend 2004,
VoteOrNot claimed to have signed up more than 100,000 people before the end of October.36
It may be difﬁcult to assess what role, if any, these Internet efforts played in the increased
youth vote turnout of the 2004 election. According to the Center for Information & Research
on Civic Learning & Engagement, it was a combination of factors, including “extensive voter
outreach efforts, a close election, and high levels of interest in the 2004 campaign” that
worked together “to drive voter turnout among young people to levels not seen since 1992.”
Nor could predictions be made as to whether the increased turnout constituted a long-term
trend.37 It is notable, however, that the midterm election of 2006 also showed a marked
increase in youth voter turnout, with two million more young people voting than in 2002.38
Regardless of their ultimate political impact, the youth vote campaigns may be important
indicators of future trends in the use of digital media for political mobilization of young
people. Based on Rock the Vote’s own documentation, its 2004 online efforts were highly
successful, bringing an unprecedented number of young people to its Web site, with more
than 45 percent of eighteen- to twenty-four-year-olds visiting the site in the months leading
up to the election. Online voter registrations totaled 1.2 million.39 At the very least, the
youth vote campaigns of 2004 demonstrate that well-funded massive outreach efforts, combining cutting-edge digital tools and strategies and popular culture venues, may succeed in
energizing large numbers of youth, at least in the short run.
The Branding of Political Discourse
To the extent that Rock the Vote may serve as a trendsetter in organizing young people
through the Internet, it is important to take a closer look at some of the patterns and
partnerships that were formed during the 2004 election. These, in turn, need to be understood
against the backdrop of larger economic developments that are underway in the emerging
youth digital culture.
One of the hallmarks of Rock the Vote’s youth-vote work is its ability to develop strong
relationships with corporations. These companies not only provide ﬁnancial support but
also participate in “co-branding” many of the major elements of the nonproﬁt’s campaigns.
While a number of other youth vote initiatives have also partnered with popular brands, Rock
the Vote has forged a unique model of democratic participation that merges the roles of fan,
consumer, and citizen. For example, in 2004, four corporate sponsors—Dr. Pepper/Seven Up,
Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s Homemade, Motorola, and Cingular Wireless—paid $1 million each
to support the Voter Registration Bus and Concert Tour.40 In partnership with a company
called Meca, the nonproﬁt created “Rock the Vote Communicator,” a “branded” version of
instant messaging, offering “six available Rock the Vote–themed skins” that were “designed
to appeal to the elusive 18–24 voter demographic.”41
Rock the Vote promoted its campaign, along with its afﬁliated brands, through software
applications, wireless technologies, and commercial Web sites that married activism and
advertising. “Rock the Vote Mobile” packaged appeals for political participation into userfriendly pop culture products designed for integration into the busy lives of young people.
Civic Life Online
According to its Web site, the mobile project was modeled on several successful “smart mob”
political efforts in other countries, including campaigns by activists in Spain the night before
the March 2004 elections, where “the spread of text messaging mobilized some thousands of
people who congregated in front of the political party running the country, Partido Popular,
in just a couple of hours.”42 But the youth vote version of these campaigns was an integrated
marketing venture with Motorola. To launch the mobile campaign, the company sent e-mails
to its thousands of cell phone users, attaching a video that featured Rachel Bilson, star of the
popular Fox TV show The O.C., inviting young people to sign up online for the campaign.
As an added incentive, the company offered sweepstakes with prizes that included Ben &
Jerry’s ice cream and Motorola handsets. Youth could be plugged into a constant stream of
interactive content and activities through their cell phones.43 Biweekly polls were able to
“take the pulse of 18-30 year-olds on top-of-mind topics from education and economics to
job creation and the war on terrorism,” campaign materials explained, and a regular feature
asked voters which candidate was “likely to get their vote on Election Day.”44 “Celebrity voice
mails. . . explained how to ﬁnd a polling place through the Web or through an automatic
patch-through to 1800MYVOTE1.”45 Users could also receive “wake-up calls” and ring tones
from Rock the Vote musicians, enter election-related contests, and participate in a variety
of text-messaging surveys. Undecided voters could take the “candidate match” survey. After
answering ten questions on issues such as the war, the environment, and the economy, they
would receive a text message with the name of the candidate who best ﬁt their own values
and interests.”46 According to the nonproﬁt, more than 120,000 people joined its mobile
The synergistic relationships between Rock the Vote and its corporate partners are emblematic of the growing practice of “cause marketing,” in which companies link their products to
causes and issues in order to build customer appreciation and loyalty. Brands seeking youth
are particularly interested in aligning with well-known causes, often willing to pay nonprofits considerable sums of money for the association. Many companies have created speciﬁc
line items in their marketing budgets for cause marketing.47 Rock the Vote’s cause marketing
model was the quintessential win–win strategy; the multi-million-dollar corporate investment played a crucial role in providing support and visibility for campaign, underwriting
new digital applications that were invented and put in place for the election. And the brands
that partnered with Rock the Vote were able to take advantage of the nonproﬁt’s ability to
reach a wide spectrum of young people through the “youth engagement Web sphere.”
Incorporating social and political messages into the content of youth entertainment has
already become a common practice in the social marketing and “entertainment-education”
campaigns of public health organizations. Television programs, music, and other popular
venues can be effective vehicles for reaching and educating young people about such issues as
sexual health, smoking, and drug abuse.48 Applying similar approaches to civic and political
engagement initiatives may help to popularize and extend participation among youth. Given
the elusiveness of the youth audience, and its value as a target market, more corporations
are likely to partner with these causes, offering their ﬁnancial largess in return for brand
exposure. To the extent that corporate investment can help support such efforts, companies
should be encouraged to become involved. However, there is also a danger that intertwining
politics with brand marketing could ultimately undermine the potential of these campaigns.
Such practices also have important implications for adolescent development. Teenagers
and young adults undergo a critical process as they acquire the necessary civic knowledge,
skills, and emotional attachments that are central to their emerging roles as citizens. As
Youth and Digital Democracy
scholars Constance Flanagan and Nakesha Faison have pointed out, “the civic identities,
political views, and values of young people are rooted in their social relations and the opportunities they have for civic practice.”49 The ubiquitous and integrated nature of marketing
in digital political engagement practices could serve to conﬂate civic identity and brand
identity during this key formative stage.
Commercialized Communities
The extension of brands into youth online politics is part of a larger set of trends in the
evolution of youth marketing in digital media. The forms of advertising, marketing, and
selling that are emerging as part of the new media depart in signiﬁcant ways from the
more familiar types of advertising and promotion in conventional media. Companies can
now forge intimate ongoing relationships with individuals. Digital technologies make it
possible to track every move, online and off, compiling elaborate personal proﬁles that
combine behavioral, psychological, and social information on individuals and aggregating
that data across platforms and over time. Youth marketers have developed a full array of
strategies, especially tailored to the needs and interests of youth, aiming to “become part of
the communication structure” of their daily lives.50
The practices that are becoming commonplace in the digital environment have important
implications for the future of democratic discourse. Of particular concern is the increasing
presence of marketing in online communities. Many of the same features of Web 2.0 that
are so valued for their participatory capabilities are being designed to incorporate marketing
applications, as investors seek to “monetize” the newest forms of digital media most popular
among youth. According to marketers at a 2006 “Search Engine Strategies” show in Silicon
Valley, social networking sites offer one of the most effective means for reaching the highly
lucrative, but challenging, youth market segment. One participant advised marketers to
track the content of blogs to ﬁnd out the interests and needs of the bloggers, suggesting
that interacting with them and participating in their postings is a great way to get to know
them and to build trust. “To be accepted,” remarked another panelist, “means to be built
into that culture.”51 A marketing conference in London—entitled “What MySpace Means:
Lessons for Every Brand”—offered advice to companies for “cultivating communities” in
these social networking spaces.52 Social networking sites have attracted huge investments in
advertising dollars. Companies are particularly eager to take advantage of the large, highly
detailed user proﬁles and expanding lists of “friends” on these sites. “The targeting we can do
is phenomenal,” one industry executive told the press.53 As companies insert themselves into
these new social networks, they are intentionally seeking to blur the lines between advertising
and content. Social networks are “breaking down that wall between what is marketing and
what isn’t,” commented one youth marketing expert. “[S]ometimes the marketing is so
embedded in the social network sphere that it draws users to interact with the brand as if
they were e-mailing friends,” explained an article in Marketing.54
The intrusion of marketing into these digital social spaces does not necessarily mean that
youth cannot still use them to engage in political debate and civic discourse—sometimes
challenging the very companies that are targeting them. Over the years, young people have
launched both online and ofﬂine “culture jamming” campaigns against corporate media.55
In their chapter in this volume, Jennifer Earl and Alan Schussman document a number of
online campaigns by youth consumers around the world that have challenged corporations
over the content of youth cultural products.56 Nor has the presence of advertising thwarted
Civic Life Online
free expression on the Internet. For example, a number of bloggers carry advertising on
their sites, enabling them to develop viable business models without interfering with their
ability to articulate their views and ﬁnd audiences.57 And despite the increasing presence
of advertising on YouTube, MySpace, and other peer-to-peer, social networking platforms,
these venues have continued to spawn an abundance of diverse viewpoints and to serve as a
forum for social protest.
However, the nature and extent of direct involvement by marketers into the daily communication and community-building activities of young people is unprecedented. Using
sophisticated data mining, research, and targeting tools, companies are able to strategically
penetrate MySpace, YouTube, and other social-networking platforms in order to exploit
them for commercial purposes. Marketers speak of “recruiting evangelists” by seeking out
the “inﬂuencing members of each social network” and turning them into “brand breeders”
or “brand advocates” for products. Youth are offered incentives to incorporate brands into
their user-generated content and distribute their work virally on the Internet, cell phones,
and iPods.58 The rampant commercialization of these nascent digital communities raises
serious questions about their future role as sites for political and civic engagement by youth.
Corporate control and commodiﬁcation of digital platforms could also bring about more
fundamental changes in these spaces, especially in the emerging broadband era. The News
Corporation’s purchase of MySpace for $580 million is a harbinger of further consolidation
trends in the online industry, as advertisers continue to seek out the youth market.59 These
trends have prompted some industry observers to predict that accommodating the needs of
advertisers will result in a change in the “architecture” of such networks. “Look for them to
make each entry into the many groups accessible via a portal for its users,” explained one
trade article. “Today, the purely linear, viral nature of the MySpace that is so much fun for
users is anything but fun for advertisers who require more content security and targeting
precision than MySpace can provide for their messages. That seems certain to change soon.”60
Key Policy Battles
In addition to these changing market practices and ownership patterns, there are several
telecommunications policy issues that are particularly relevant to the future of youth democratic communications. Most of these issues have been highly contentious, sparking a series
of ongoing political skirmishes, fought inside the beltway and online, part of what Yochai
Benkler calls “the battle over the institutional ecology of the digital environment.”61 In the
following pages, I brieﬂy discuss four of the most critical policies that are likely to affect the
basic structure and operating practices of digital communications—network neutrality, intellectual property, equitable access, and community broadband—including a few accounts
of how some youth activists have become involved in the debates. I also address the debate
over online safety. While not as directly connected to these “institutional ecology” concerns,
this issue is nonetheless signiﬁcantly related to the continuing role of youth in the public
policy arena.
Network Neutrality.
Although the term “network neutrality” is a recent invention , the concept (which is sometimes also
called “open access”) has a long history in communications technology and regulation.62
Telephone monopolies in the United States have operated on a similar principle for many
decades, regulated as “common carriers,” which are required to offer services to anyone
on the basis of nondiscriminatory rates. As conduits for communication, the companies are
Youth and Digital Democracy
not involved in the content of what they carry. This tradition in the regulation of phone
lines became a basic underpinning of Internet technology.63 A combination of government
regulation and funding of the basic infrastructure, along with principles of open-source
technology, created the Internet as we know it. Even after it was privatized in the 1990s, the
Internet has perpetuated many of these traditions that enable end-to-end and many-to-many
communication. As Adam Cohen explained in a New York Times editorial, Tim Berners-Lee
created the World Wide Web (which runs on top of the Internet) “in a decentralized way
that allowed anyone with a computer to connect to it and begin receiving and sending
information. That open architecture is what has allowed for the growth of Internet commerce
and communication.” These inherent technological features are also critical underpinnings
to newer peer-to-peer applications.64
The fundamental principles that underlie Internet architecture have eroded in recent
years, owing to a series of regulatory decisions and market trends. In 2005, under lobbying pressure from telephone companies, the Federal Communications Commission eliminated the rules for nondiscrimination, content treatment, and interconnection that had
been part of the common carrier paradigm.65 (Unlike telephone companies, cable companies, which have become major providers of broadband Internet services, have never operated as common carriers.) Most consumers have a choice between one of two broadband
providers—the local cable company or the local telephone company. While other technologies such as community broadband might provide viable competition in the future,
there is no guarantee that this will be the case. (See discussion of community broadband
later.) As a result, the diversity, openness, and competition that characterized the Internet in the dial-up era could be seriously undermined. The distribution policies of phone
and cable companies could limit applications considered less ﬁnancially proﬁtable, favoring
instead the content with which they have a ﬁnancial relationship. Instead of nondiscriminatory carriage, network owners are likely to apply different policies to content they own
or in which they invest.66 (The cable industry has a long tradition of such discrimination,
with many multisystem operators—MSOs—rejecting new channels in which they are not
themselves invested or insisting on becoming ﬁnancial partners with new programming
ventures.)67
The implications for democratic communications are signiﬁcant. Developments in the
business practices of the broadband industry threaten to undermine the archetypal “level
playing ﬁeld” that the Internet has long provided, in which content providers are accorded
equal treatment in the online environment, and users enjoy access to any Internet resource,
service, or application. Network neutrality could provide new openings for youth participation in emerging digital media platforms, ensuring continuation of the openness and free
access that the public has come to expect with the Internet. However, in the absence of
an afﬁrmative policy to guarantee network neutrality, civic and political uses of new media could be undermined. Analysis of existing, as well as planned, policies by broadband
providers indicate that discriminatory access and distribution could become commonplace
in the networks of the future.68 Internal industry documents from technology companies
such as Cisco and Allot Communications have warned cable and phone companies about
the need to “limit unproﬁtable peer-to-peer communications” or, in some cases, ban them
altogether.69
The political battle over network neutrality could be a precursor to future digital media
policy campaigns, in which online users, including large numbers of youth, can be mobilized
through the new participatory tools on the Internet. Advocacy groups on both sides of the
issue have proactively reached out to the blogging community to advance their arguments.
Civic Life Online
Bloggers have also been quick to pounce on several statements by industry leaders that
have served as a ﬂashpoint for heated online debate. When AT&T Chairman Edward E.
Whitacre, Jr., told Business Week that he thought companies such as Yahoo! and Google
should be charged for using broadband to reach their customers, the remark sparked a
storm of protest by bloggers. In a subsequent press article, an executive at BellSouth said
that his company would consider charging Apple an additional ﬁve to ten cents every time a
customer downloaded a song from iTunes. This remark triggered a second wave of turbulence
in the blogosphere over concerns that such additional costs would inevitably be passed onto
consumers.70 Increased costs for downloads could affect not only music but also the full
range of other content now available through broadband.
The pro–network neutrality Save the Internet Campaign, spearheaded by the nonproﬁt
advocacy group Free Press, has made a strategic effort to enlist the involvement of bloggers.
Working with MoveOn.org, Free Press cultivated a following of bloggers who were interested
in the issue, using their blogrolls to build a list of more than six thousand bloggers and
then providing them with links to the Save the Internet campaign site. The group also
organized an exclusive “blogger only” press call, inviting experts to explain the policy issues
surrounding network neutrality and to encourage further coverage online.71 Such efforts are
a reﬂection of the growing importance of bloggers to issue advocates, who now routinely
cultivate relationships with inﬂuential members of the blogosphere.72
Network neutrality advocates also made a special effort to reach out to online youth
through popular social networking and video sites. For its MySpace effort, Free Press enlisted
the help of organizers who had been involved in the online youth vote mobilization efforts in
2004. The MySpace Save the Internet proﬁle features blurbs, FAQs, cartoons, blog entries, and
links to advocacy videos created by young people on the user-generated site YouTube.com.
Members who create links to the Save the Internet Campaign on their own proﬁles can be
rewarded with a free “exclusive MP3 download” with information on the issue.73 As the
network neutrality controversy became more prominent in the blogosphere, some individuals began making their own videos and distributing them on YouTube. Free Press quickly
decided to take advantage of it, promoting the videos on the Save the Internet Web site and
creating a gallery of more than twenty of them, thus spawning a “virtuous circle” as more
and more people began viewing the videos on YouTube. Some of the videos became instant
online phenomena, distributed virally to millions of individuals, and revealing how the issue resonates with many members of the digital generation.74 Many reﬂect a passion and
energy about the issue that is quite remarkable, as well as imaginative ways of rendering the
complexities of media policy in understandable, visceral terms that other youth can easily
grasp. For example, one video begins with a Web site featuring archival footage of old Warner
Brothers cartoons. The cartoons are suddenly interrupted by the familiar multicolored bars
of a television emergency broadcast. A young man comes on, playing the part of a media
company executive, and tells the Web site operator that he is being shut down. But the Web
site operator counters with his own threats against the virtual intruder. The video ends with
the tag line “It’s your Internet.”75 Such messages reﬂect the feelings of personal ownership
that many youth hold about the digital media, as well as a sense of optimism about their
ability to counter any threats to their continued use of these tools. However, in the real
world of Washington politics, the battle for nondiscriminatory practices in the broadband
era faces substantial opposition.
Activists did successfully intervene in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC’s)
2006 approval of the merger of AT&T and BellSouth, winning concessions that the new
Youth and Digital Democracy
company would adhere to principles of network neutrality for two years. Members of the
new Democratic-controlled Congress also promised to introduce legislation in 2007 to make
net neutrality a Federal law.76 But the ultimate outcome of the issue remains uncertain.
Intellectual Property.
Intellectual property and copyright issues have been front and center
in the digital experiences of young people, directly affecting their daily media practices. Much
of the public discourse over copyright in the Internet era has been focused on peer-to-peer
music ﬁle sharing, with youth at the center of the controversy, cast often as opportunistic
freeloaders who are taking what they can for their own personal uses. In 2003, the music
industry began ﬁling lawsuits against individual users and their families, as well as against
popular ﬁle sharing companies such as Napster and KaZaa. These efforts have produced
signiﬁcant changes in online business practices, forcing major ﬁle-sharing operators either
to shut down or to dramatically change how they operate.77 As the result of these aggressive
legal and PR campaigns, as well as the rise in new music downloading pay services such as
iTunes, illegal downloading has been on a decline. At the height of the ﬁrst wave of lawsuits,
surveys of young people suggested that many of them had decided to cease the practice,
although subsequent studies indicated that a sizable number of youth still believed it both
impractical and, in many cases, unfair to expect them to discontinue doing so.78
The intense public focus on music and video piracy has obscured the broader impacts
of intellectual property policies, especially on public discourse and democratic expression.
Press coverage of crucial legislation and regulatory decisions has often been framed as a
business issue, with little public knowledge of its wider implications. For example, the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) received very little media attention at the time of its
passage in 1998. The law criminalizes the production and dissemination of technologies
that could circumvent encoded copy protection devices, imposing penalties as high as ten
years in prison or $1 million in ﬁnes for willful violations of the provision.79
In Free Culture, legal scholar Lawrence Lessig provides a well-documented set of arguments
that the current direction of intellectual property regulation in the United States threatens
not only the Internet but also the larger culture.80 In the digital era, where sharing, critiquing,
modifying, and linking to the content created by others have become an expected and essential part of public discourse, digital copyright laws have created complication and confusion,
and posed challenges to bloggers and other online content creators. The nonproﬁt Electronic
Frontier Foundation, a leader in many of the legal battles against copyright infringement lawsuits, has created an online resource speciﬁcally for bloggers who are uncertain about what
they can and cannot do on their own blogs. The site explains a number of important legal
concepts, along with the procedures that must be followed if an Internet Service Provider
chooses to remove a posting in response to a copyright infringement complaint. As the site
points out, the DMCA has made it much easier for an ISP to take content down without
risking liability. Although a blogger whose posting has been removed does have recourse,
the entire discussion is a reminder of the complex legal framework within which bloggers
and other online commentators must operate, whether they realize it or not.81
Passage of the DMCA has spawned a movement of intellectuals and nonproﬁts working
to educate the public about the role of copyright law in free and open democratic discourse.
The Creative Commons, a nonproﬁt founded by Lessig, enables copyright holders to create
“ﬂexible licenses” that set the terms under which others can use their work, thus providing
an alternative to the rigidity of current copyright law.82 But additional intellectual property
measures have been advanced that could have important implications for the future.83 In
Civic Life Online
the ensuing years, copyright battles will continue to be fought in the courts, in Congress,
and at the FCC.
Several youth activist groups have become involved in intellectual property issues, with
music as a key touchstone. For example, Downhill Battle, founded by a group of college
students in 2003, has used the Web to engage in “digital civil disobedience” over what it sees
as repressive copyright laws.84 One of the group’s key tactics is to create “stunt pages,” such as
“iTunes is Bogus,” which is designed to look like the ofﬁcial iTunes home page, but carries a
message attacking the company for some of its business practices.85 Downhill Battle’s “Grey
Tuesday” Internet campaign earned the group widespread recognition within the online
activist community, as well as mainstream press coverage. After EMI and Capitol Records
threatened legal action against the creator of the “mash-up” Grey Album, and anyone who
distributed it, the activist group staged an online protest, offering free downloads of the
album on its Web site, and encouraging 400 Web sites to turn their sites “grey” for a day.
Activists at Downhill Battle used the event as a way to publicize their concerns over copyright
law, generating attention from major news outlets, including the New York Times, MTV, and
the BBC.86 Downhill Battle has established a nonproﬁt Participatory Culture Foundation,
developing and promoting new software applications and technologies for creating a doit-yourself “free culture.”87 The foundation has launched a new open-source platform for
producing and distributing video online, called “the Democracy Internet TV Platform.” The
activists see this project as part of their mission to “create a television culture that is ﬂuid,
diverse, exciting, and beautiful.”88
Whether these efforts will be effective at changing any of the existing intellectual and
copyright policies, or at preventing further privatization of culture in the digital media,
remains to be seen. But engaging young people around the policies that directly affect their
own media culture may help them to see the larger connections between their everyday
experiences with digital media and the political and cultural forces that are shaping the
overall new-media environment.
Equitable Access.
Ensuring equitable access to technology is a policy issue that has largely
fallen off the public radar, but nonetheless remains important. During the early nineties, as
the Internet was beginning to make its way into the mainstream, the federal government
made “bridging the digital divide” a national priority. The Clinton administration’s 1993
Agenda for Action called for all schools, libraries, and hospitals to be connected to the
Internet by the year 2000.89 Library and education groups lobbied a provision into the 1996
Telecommunications Act that extended the FCC’s Universal Service program to advanced
telecommunications services. The act established subsidies (often called the “e-rate”) for
eligible schools and libraries and for rural health care providers to connect to the Internet.90
This law, combined with a number of public/private initiatives at the local and state levels,
has helped to close the digital divide in the nation’s schools. Between 1996 and 2002, the
number of schools wired to the Internet went from 65 to 99 percent, with the percentage
of wired classrooms rising from 14 to 92 percent. Libraries more than tripled their Internet
connections, increasing from 28 to 95 percent during those same years.91 A 2004 report
released by the Consortium for School Networking (CoSN) found that 95 percent of all
classrooms nationwide had high-speed access.92
But while public policies have helped ensure greater access through schools and libraries,
they have not yet erased the troubling gap between young people with access at home and
those without it.93 Although teens and young adults are more likely to have Internet access than other age groups, 13 percent of youth between the ages of twelve and seventeen
Youth and Digital Democracy
remained disconnected from the digital universe. As a 2005 Pew Internet & American Life report explained, “Those who remain ofﬂine are clearly deﬁned by lower levels of income and
limited access to technology,” with African American youth underrepresented online in disproportionate numbers. These patterns were consistent with overall Internet penetration.94
A 2004 report by the Leadership Council on Civil Rights found similar racial disparities in
Internet access. Blacks and Latinos, the study noted, are “much less likely than whites to
have access to home computers than are white, non-Latinos (50.6 and 48.7 percent compared to 74.6 percent). They are also less likely to have Internet access at home (40.5 and
38.1 percent compared to 67.3 percent). Ethnic and racial disparities in home computer and
Internet access rates are larger for children than for adults.”95
A 2006 survey by the Pew Internet & American Life Project presented a somewhat more
hopeful prospect for equitable access to broadband, ﬁnding that high-speed connections
in the United States had jumped in the previous year, due in part to the fact that many
people have moved directly to cable or DSL broadband when they go online, skipping dialup connections altogether. This rapid growth in broadband adoption, the report explained,
is “very strong in middle-income households, particularly for African Americans and those
with low levels of education.”96 However, further progress is needed before broadband access
will be available to all young people, regardless of geography or income. In an article in the
Washington Monthly, Robert McChesney and John Podesta note that while both President
Bush and the FCC have made commitments to ensuring universal access to broadband
technology by 2007, progress remains slow, with the United States lagging far behind many
other countries, falling from fourth to sixteenth in broadband penetration since 2001. “In
the not-so-distant future,” the authors explain, “broadband will be an indispensable part of
economic, personal, and public life.”97 For the time being at least, many youth—especially
those in poorer households—may have to rely on their schools or local libraries to take
advantage of high-speed Internet.
Community Broadband.
Community broadband (especially wireless, or “WiFi”) networks
could go a long way to ensuring that universal access becomes a reality. Advocates point
out that there is a long tradition of cities and counties operating electricity and other utility systems for their communities. In the contemporary communications era, publicly run
telecommunications systems could provide needed competition to the local telephone and
cable monopolies. As public services, such systems can ensure not only more affordable rates
but also more effective participation by local civic and political organizations. Many of the
youth community projects that are using the Internet to interact with their members and
with the public could beneﬁt from community broadband. Municipally operated networks
could also help guarantee expanded capacity and services for local schools, libraries, and
other public institutions. According to a study by the DC-based Media Access Project, “hundreds of local governments have begun exploring how to provide high-speed broadband
through municipal or community networks, either directly or in partnership with others.”98
Despite these promising developments, however, there are a number of obstacles that could
thwart efforts to promote community broadband across the country. One of the largest is
organized opposition from telephone and cable companies that fear competition from municipalities. Telecommunications industry lobbyists have successfully lobbied in legislation
in fourteen states that restrict future public broadband projects, with a number of other states
considering such moves.99 Another obstacle is the lack of usable spectrum. As McChesney
and Podesta point out, many existing WiFi networks have to operate in “junk bands” that are
“cluttered with signals from cordless phones, microwave ovens, baby monitors, and other
Civic Life Online
consumer devices. At lower frequencies—like the television band—signals travel farther and
can go through walls, trees, and mountains. Opening up some of this spectrum would make
Community Internet systems much faster and cheaper to deploy.”100 Many of the same nonproﬁts that are ﬁghting for afﬁrmative national network neutrality policies are also leading
the community broadband movement, including Media Access Project, Consumers Union,
Consumer Federation of America, and Free Press. Prometheus Radio Project—a Philadelphiabased group of young people who have been advocating release of low-power radio spectrum
for community purposes and organizing “barnstorming” of new low-power radio stations
across the country—has embraced the goal of promoting community broadband.101
Online Safety.
Concerns over “cyberporn” and its impact on the safety of children and
youth began during the midnineties. The Communications Decency Act (CDA), passed as
part of the omnibus Telecommunications Act of 1996, imposed ﬁnes and possible jail sentences on anyone found guilty of transmitting obscene or indecent material, knowing that
minors under eighteen could receive it. But as Marjorie Heins, one of the lawyers who opposed the CDA, has noted, the wording of the law was “a masterwork of internal confusion,”
reﬂecting a failure by Congress to understand fully the nature of the Internet and creating
an opening for a legal challenge.102 Civil liberty groups fought throughout the two years of
congressional deliberations to prevent the bill from passing, staging an online day of protest
on the eve of the ﬁnal vote. Failing in this effort, they immediately challenged the CDA in
the courts, and the Supreme Court struck it down within a year of its original passage.103
Despite this clear victory, numerous bills have been introduced in the ten years since the
passage of the CDA, and several have become law. The Child Online Protection Act (COPA),
enacted in 1998, would make it a crime for commercial organizations to allow access by
minors under seventeen to sexual material deemed “harmful to minors.”104 Because of challenges by civil liberty groups, the law has been blocked in a series of court decisions. In 2004,
the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the most recent court injunction but sent the case back down
to a lower court, instructing it to evaluate whether technological advances would provide
adequate protections and eliminate the need for the law.105 In contrast to COPA, the Child
Internet Protection Act (CIPA), passed in 2000, has been successfully implemented. That law
requires libraries and schools receiving Federal discounts and funding for computers and
Internet access (under the U.S. government’s e-rate program) to install ﬁlters on computers
used by minors, in order to restrict their access to harmful material on the Internet.106
CIPA has created a legal framework for subsequent legislative vehicles speciﬁcally focused
on social networking software such as MySpace, Friendster, and Facebook. Under the proposed Deleting Online Predators Act (DOPA), which was passed overwhelmingly by the
U.S. House of Representatives in July 2006, CIPA would have been extended to require
schools and libraries in the e-rate program to limit young peoples’ access to social networking sites, blogs, and wiki’s.107 The blog search site Technorati revealed nearly 1,200 mentions
of the controversial legislation, including an informative discussion with scholars Henry
Jenkins and danah boyd, who pointed out that such a law would be far too broad.108 As
boyd explained, the proposed legislation would have limited “access to any commercial site
that allows users to create a proﬁle and communicate with strangers,” blocking not only
MySpace but also “blogging tools, mailing lists, video and podcast sites, photo sharing
sites, and educational sites.” boyd and others have also noted that the statistics on online predators are much lower than many in the public may think, with less than .01
percent of all youth abductions nationwide occurring between strangers. Nor is there
Youth and Digital Democracy
any evidence as yet that stranger abductions have occurred because of social network
services.”109
But the politics of cultural policy have often skewed the facts in order to promote particular agendas. For policy makers, protecting children is a compelling issue that can easily
be exploited. The possibility, however remote, of children being harmed by strangers on
MySpace is more palpable than the concept of ensuring a participatory culture for young
people in the digital media. Whether or not legislative efforts to regulate social networking sites are ultimately successful, the debate and press coverage surrounding the issue of
online safety could have a chilling effect on youth expression in the digital media. For example, school districts and libraries, fearing controversy and parental objections, may decide
voluntarily to block youth access to an entire class of new tools for online participation.
These events are also reminders that the Internet’s potential as a tool for unfettered political
expression by youth is not immune to political forces. The controversy over MySpace is in
many ways a replay of earlier debates that have accompanied the growth of the Internet.
Since the early nineties, when the Internet began to make its way into mainstream culture,
public discourse over the new medium and its role in the lives of children and youth has
been dominated by concerns over harms. The persistent public focus on Internet safety has
not only dominated much of the public debate over youth and new media but has also
created a climate within the government, the educational community, and the industry that
positions young people primarily as potential victims in need of protections, rather than
productive participants in digital media culture. In addition to repeated attempts to regulate
Internet content, ongoing public concern over Internet harms has spawned a spectrum of
protective software and technologies, including ﬁltering and blocking services, as well as
labeling and rating systems, all aimed at shielding children and youth from harmful online
content.110 But more important, such fears have diverted attention away from developing a
broader understanding of the role of digital media as a positive force in the lives of children
and youth.
Although government action on some of the policies described in the preceding pages
could take place in the near future, most of these issues are likely to remain in play for quite
some time, creating opportunities to enlarge the terms of the debate over the future of digital
media, and to enlist the involvement of a broader segment of the public.
Reframing the Debate, Fulﬁlling the Promise
By examining the myriad ways in which youth are engaging in the new media, we can begin
to rethink the role of young people in the media culture and in the society as a whole.
As other authors in this volume have documented, we already have abundant evidence of
the ways in which many youth are seizing the new digital tools to participate more fully
in democracy. The hundreds of civic Web sites created in the last decade are helping to
provide young people with some of the essential skills for civic and political engagement.
Interactive media make it much easier for them to learn about critical issues of the day,
insert their own voices into the public discourse, and actively participate in a wide range of
political causes. The 2004 youth vote initiatives are powerful illustrations of how the Internet
can be harnessed as an effective mobilizing force in electoral politics. The online efforts of
Downhill Battle, FreeCulture.org, and other Internet activist groups demonstrate how some
young people are not only creating and distributing their own cultural products but are also
ﬁghting some of the crucial policy battles over the future of the digital media system.
Civic Life Online
To the extent that they are indicators of larger trends, these developments give us reason
to celebrate. But despite the numerous examples of young people’s empowerment through
digital media, serious questions remain about whether such forms of participation can be
extended to a broader segment of the youth population, and sustained beyond the occasional
bursts of activity surrounding extraordinary events, such as high-stakes national elections.
There are also opposing tendencies in the new media that could serve both to enhance
and to undermine its democratic potential in the lives of young people. For example, the
capacity for collective action, community building, and mobilization are unprecedented. But
the move toward increasingly personalized media and one-to-one marketing may encourage
self-obsession, instant gratiﬁcation, and impulsive behaviors.
Whether the Internet ultimately becomes a force for civic and political renewal among
youth remains to be seen. However, even though many of the business practices are already in place, there is still enough ﬂuidity in the emerging digital media system to enable
decisions to be made to help guide its future. With the support of foundations and government agencies in the United States and abroad, some scholars have begun to explore this
potential.111 Hopefully, these efforts will grow into a broader movement. To deepen our understanding of the new media culture, its institutions, and its varied and complex roles in the
lives of children and youth, we will need a broader, more comprehensive multidisciplinary
effort, combining the contributions of communications researchers, political scientists, historians, sociologists, anthropologists, economists, and young people themselves. In addition
to studies of individual uses of new media, there is an urgent need for serious ongoing examination of the institutions that are creating this digital culture, both its commercial and
its noncommercial sectors.
As we consider the policy issues for the next phase of the Digital Age, the goal of fostering
a healthy, democratic media culture for young people must be a top priority. These policies
need to be understood as the building blocks for a framework that will support democratic
communications in the future. The exact shape of the policy framework is less important than
the key set of principles that must guide it. These include equitable access to technology, open
architecture and nondiscrimination for both consumers and producers of digital content,
ﬂexible and fair copyright rules that allow for creativity and sharing of cultural content, and
open-source applications that will encourage collaboration and innovation.
Finally, we need a series of national and international conversations, informed by research,
on how digital technologies can best serve the needs of children and youth. Youth should
be involved directly in that dialogue as key stakeholders, innovators, and leaders. If done
well, this process could lead to major public and private initiatives that would help ensure
that the democratic potential of the Internet is fulﬁlled and sustained over the long run,
beneﬁting successive generations of young people.

with support from major foundations, the international nonproﬁt Save the Children conducted market research to identify ways to engage teens in a variety of domestic and global political issues—such
as violence, child exploitation, hunger, homelessness, HIV/AIDS, and hate crimes. Its project, Youth-
NOISE.com, launched in 2001, was consciously modeled on the highly popular teen portal BOLT.com.
The compelling and colorful site was equipped with many of the standard “sticky features”—quizzes,
contests, discussion boards, and the like—of other dot.com sites, inviting young people to communicate
with their peers and to contribute their own content to the site. To enhance its visibility and reach,
YouthNOISE forged a strategic partnership with AOL Time Warner, and cross-promoted its content
through afﬁliations with Seventeen Magazine, Yahoo, and other media vehicles with large teen audiences. For a proﬁle and history of YouthNOISE, see chapter 3, A Tale of Two Sites, in Montgomery,

Introduction
Young people have traditionally been at the forefront of new information technology use, remaining at the top of Internet usage statistics and distinguishing themselves as early adopters
of features such as instant messaging, peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing, and social networking tools.1
As noted in the introduction to this volume, today’s younger citizens are among the ﬁrst to
have come of age surrounded by digital technologies. They not only demonstrate ﬂuency
with new ways of communicating and connecting through them but are also helping to
deﬁne the contours of their adoption. Despite a surge in voter turnout among eighteento twenty-four-year-olds in the 2004 presidential election, however, this age group has also
typically been understood as trendsetters in the area of declining social capital, positioned
at the forefront of falling rates of civic engagement and political participation.2 With respect to voting in particular, researchers have long noted the general decline in youth voter
turnout over the past few decades, interrupted only sporadically by spikes such as that seen
With an eye toward the dramatic growth in political communication and activity online
in the past decade, many have hoped that developments in the political uses of new media
might have the potential to help fuel a return of the young hypermedia generation to healthier patterns of electoral participation. In this way, we might imagine Howard Rheingold’s
Shibuya Crossing morphing into a raucous, youthful partisan convention.4 On the
surface, the events of the 2004 U.S. elections would seem to have buoyed such a convenient
assessment of the intersections between trends in new media, politics and youth participation. During the 2004 primary process, citizens waged an online effort to “draft Wesley
Clark” as a candidate, and the Howard Dean campaign took Web campaigning to new levels
with the creative integration of tools such as Meetup.com and blogging. Although neither
of these campaigns went beyond the primaries, the trend of increasing technological sophistication in the campaigns certainly did, as both major party presidential candidates ﬁelded
sophisticated campaign Web sites that supplemented traditional campaign Web site fare,
such as candidate biographies and issues statements, with newer features like blogs, greater
use of multimedia, and other interactive techniques.5
For their part, the wider electorate followed the candidates into cyberspace in 2004, in
many ways led by young voters. Looking at the electorate as a whole, an estimated 75 million
Americans, representing 37 percent of the adult population and more than half of American
Internet users, went online to get information about the 2004 campaigns and engage in
Civic Life Online
the political process; a substantial number, some 20 million, were estimated to have used
the Internet to monitor campaign developments daily up to the close of the election.6 In
marked departure from their stereotypical indifference to politics, younger Americans were
a surprisingly vibrant part of these broader statistics, showing marked increases in reading
news of the election, talking about it with others, and thinking about the election and how
the outcome might affect them.7 An estimated 28 percent of eighteen- to twenty-nine-yearolds accessed most of their information about the 2004 election from the Internet, up from
22 percent in 2000, and more than those in any other age group.8
Most notably, turnout for young voters in the Internet-intensive 2004 election was the
highest in more than a decade. Naturally, much of this increase can be explained by factors
unrelated to new media, like the partisan tendencies of youth as a group and their particular
interest in the Iraq war as a policy issue in 2004.9 However, given the optimistic hopes
associated with new media and the reliance of young people on the Internet for political
information, it is tempting to view these developments as fueled in part by online politics.
But a closer and more systematic look reveals a yawning generation gap between the Web
production practices of traditional political actors (especially political candidates and their
campaigns) and the preferences and expectations that today’s young people bring to political
cyberspace. As long as this gap remains unexplored, we believe optimism about the potential
of online politics to reverse historic declines in youth participation in the electoral arena
may be premature.
The generational disconnect in online politics is evident in the features typically used
(and not used) by candidates campaigning online, and in the relative absence of direct
(or even indirect) appeals to young voters on most candidate Web sites. To be sure, some
of the roots of this gap lie in the exigencies of electoral competition in the United States,
speciﬁcally the relatively small and historically shrinking part of the electorate represented by
younger voters. However, we suggest that differences between campaigns’ and young voters’
perspectives on interactivity, control, and the value of coproduction may be signiﬁcantly
compromising the full potential of the Internet as a positive force for reinvigoration of
youth political participation, thus exacerbating the problem.
In this chapter, we attempt to identify and help understand the basic structure of the chasm
between typical uses of the Internet by political candidates and leaders, and the expectations
of a younger cohort that is increasingly turning to the Internet for political information.
To do so we draw on a variety of research data, ranging from feature analyses of campaign
Web sites, to survey data and interviews with campaign site producers, as well as detailed
focus group discussions with young citizens about their experiences with and expectations
of campaign Web sites.
We begin by discussing a number of relevant patterns in the uses of digital media by
young people, and their attitudes toward new communication technologies. By supplementing publicly available data from representative national samples with more ﬁnely grained
responses from student focus groups conducted during the 2000 presidential election, we
highlight important aspects of the modus operandi of young people’s uses of the Internet
for general, as well as political, purposes. Drawing from these data, we then derive a set
of baseline expectations about Web production and Web use against which the potential
for campaigns to capture and sustain the interest of young voters via the Internet may be
After establishing a basic understanding of youth preferences with respect to political
uses of the Web, we turn to a counterpart examination of the contemporary practices of
Not Your Father’s Internet
the primary players in the world of electoral politics online. In doing so, we focus on U.S.
House, Senate, and gubernatorial candidates. Although presidential candidates typically get
the bulk of attention from Internet observers and commentators, it is candidates for these
lesser ofﬁces that make up the lion’s share of online electoral campaigns, so we focus our
attention on their efforts to campaign online. Here, we assess the feature characteristics of
campaigns’ Web production practices, drawing on prior analyses we conducted with other
scholars of a very large sample of U.S. campaign Web sites.10 With these data, we explore
a distinction between different ways of approaching online campaigning we have demonstrated elsewhere, within the speciﬁc context of digital media, politics, and American youth.
Speciﬁcally, we distinguish between Web production practices we identify as adapting traditional campaigning to the Web and those we identify as Web campaigning, which uniquely tap
the interactive and networking potentials of digital media.11 Consistent with other research
in this area,12 our data document the tendency of candidates to rely heavily on the former
set of practices, remaining out of step with the expectations of a younger set of site visitors.
Moving beyond basic features and design elements, we also discuss results from additional
content analyses of campaign Web sites conducted during the 2002 and 2004 election cycles,
which document the surprising paucity (given the relative dominance of younger citizens
online) of direct or indirect appeals to youth on these sites.13 Finally, we review research on
similar campaign Web sites from the 2004 elections and discuss some of the patterns that
emerged in online campaigning for the 2006 elections, which show the enduring nature
of the disconnect between how candidates and young people appear to be engaging the
political Web.
Having identiﬁed the basic structure of the generational gap between youth expectations
about the presentation of materials and information on the Web and the actual products
offered to young consumers of political information by those at the center of electoral politics
online, we devote the remainder of the chapter to fundamental differences between younger
citizens’ and traditional political actors’ approaches to digital media. Speciﬁcally, we explore
a variety of ways of thinking about one of the Web’s signature affordances, interactivity, as it
relates to online politics and American youth. While most Web surfers are familiar with the
general concept of interactivity, scholars have engaged in a lively debate over its essential
elements.14 Setting aside the search for consensus on the true nature of interactivity, we
instead draw on some of the different dimensions of interactivity identiﬁed in these debates
to explain more systematically the generation gap in online politics. By applying these ideas
to the differences identiﬁed in the ﬁrst two sections of the chapter, we hope to point the
way toward strategies that political candidates and other practitioners of online politics can
use to more effectively reach out to would-be young voters online.
Youth Demand for the Political Web
In considering the ways that younger voters use the Internet for political purposes, it is
important to consider both the extent and nature of youth preferences and tastes for online
political information resources. It is also important to consider some relevant aspects of
youth Web use that fall outside of electoral politics or even the broader conceptions of
politics found in other chapters of this volume. How much interest do young people exhibit
in ﬁnding political information online? What kind of information do they seek? When
young citizens use the Internet for political or other uses, what do they like to do, and
how? By considering all of these factors together, we can begin to paint a picture of the
Civic Life Online
kinds of expectations and preferences that young people bring to the Web when seeking
information about politics, whether from Rock the Vote, the League of Women Voters, a
candidate seeking ofﬁce, or from their online peer network.
It is commonplace to refer to the crisis of youth disengagement from politics, but it is clear
that in both the online environment in general and the world of politics and public affairs
on the Web in particular, the youth cohort is active and vibrant. By a variety of measures,
the demand for political information on the Web among young people rivals or eclipses
that of those in other age groups. By now, most are aware of the widespread adoption of
Internet technology among teens and eighteen- to twenty-nine-year-olds. Similarly, most
are also familiar with the fact that survey data routinely shows this age group to possess
relatively low general interest in politics as traditionally conceived (and practiced by the
“dutiful citizen” described by Bennett in this volume). However, the presence of teens and
eighteen- to twenty-nine-year-olds in the online world of news and political information is
formidable. As noted earlier, the eighteen- to twenty-nine-year-old age group was the most
likely age cohort to seek political information online during the 2004 elections.15 And, if we
look at a slightly broader category of turning to the Web for general news, we see similar
patterns. Indeed, survey data suggests that eighteen- to twenty-nine-year-olds are the most
likely to seek news from sources like the Internet and late-night comedy programs and are
the least likely to seek news from the traditional channels of network programming and daily
newspapers.16 Simply comparing teens to adults in a head-to-head matchup, we ﬁnd that
regular Internet users in both categories get news from online sources at about the same rate,
with “[t]hree-quarters (76%) of online teens and 73% of online adults” getting at least some
news from the Internet.17 Given that youth possess a lower interest in news generally,18 these
ﬁgures further highlight the preference of youth for new media over traditional channels.
Moreover, as Kathryn Montgomery and others have documented, there has also been an
explosion of youth-oriented political portals in recent years, with familiar sites like Rock the
Vote being joined in a burgeoning youth political Web sphere by dozens of other youth sites
related to campaigns and elections, and hundreds more devoted to broader public and social
concerns.19
Another way of approaching the question of youth demand for politics online is through
their reactions to the efforts of candidates to engage them through new media. Perhaps related to the fact that they have long been the most intensive users of the Web, youth are
certainly among the Web’s most discerning and demanding users. This point was made clear
to one of the authors through focus groups conducted during the 2000 presidential primary
elections with groups of college students. Equipped with a laptop, high-speed Internet connection, and projector, each group collectively navigated its way through several campaign
and nonpartisan civic sites while a moderator elicited feedback from the group on various
aspects of the sites. Student participants consistently provided highly detailed commentary,
noting all manner of visual and technical details, including the speciﬁc placement of various items (and what that communicated), as well as the frequency with which sites were
perceived to have been updated.
One focus group centered on the ﬁrst ever online fundraising event, the John McCain
campaign’s “Cyber Express Webcast” in February 2000 which was promoted as a “live and
interactive” event.20 Those who wished to participate in the Webcast had to register with
the campaign ahead of time and contribute $100 each to receive the URL for the hour-long
Webcast. One member of the focus group research team registered for the event, and the
Webcast was projected onto a large screen so that all focus group members were able to view it.
Not Your Father’s Internet
Webcast participants were invited to e-mail questions to the candidate during the event, and
streaming video featured John McCain ﬁelding questions—presumably a selection of those
that were being received by the campaign via e-mail. The Webcast consisted of four primary
information streams. A live video feed featured John and Cindy McCain sitting at a table,
with Cindy McCain reading the questions and her husband answering them. In a window
below the video feed, a text box streamed questions submitted by audience members. A series
of still photographs and graphics were displayed in another part of the window illustrating
Senator McCain’s comments or emphasizing his issue positions. In addition, occasional
“poll” questions and tallied results were presented to the audience.
Without question, the event featured an innovative use of the Internet, and was the
ﬁrst of several live Internet-based presentations by candidates during the 2000 campaign
season and beyond. McCain’s campaign took a risk by putting their candidate in a novel
situation fraught with potential technical disaster. However, the focus group students—
mostly committed Republicans and one strong McCain supporter—were disappointed that
the McCain campaign did not make fuller use of Internet technologies during the Webcast. In
contrast to the event’s billing as a live and interactive Webcast, these young voters described
it in bleaker terms. They perceived McCain’s event to lack both the intimacy of an in-person
fundraiser and the intensity of a live debate.
For example, even though the group witnessed the Webcast via a high-speed connection,
the video feed froze frequently and the audio stream was interrupted every few minutes.
“It’s like the difference between going to a live concert and listening to a CD,” one young
man commented partway through the Webcast, “a bad CD.” By the end of the event he had
further downgraded his evaluation, saying, “It’s worse than a CD.”
Naturally, some of the technical aspects of this example are artifacts of a time when
streaming video was not as reliable as it is today. However, focus group participants were
also quite skeptical of the event on a deeper level. Of particular concern was the “interactive” nature of the question-and-answer process. For example, all subscribers to the Webcast
could e-mail an unlimited number of questions and comments to the McCain Web site,
and all e-mails received a nearly immediate response from a McCain staff member. Some
questions were screened out by the McCain staff and not made visible to other subscribers,
including a message submitted by a researcher containing intentionally inﬂammatory language. In all, more than 250 questions and comments were posted to the Webcast. During
the ﬁfty-minute event, McCain responded to twelve. Collectively, the students in the focus group submitted over a dozen questions, ranging from ones they considered “easy”
to those they knew would be challenging for the candidate to address. Although McCain
could not possibly have responded to all questions, he did not address any of the questions submitted by the focus group participants, nor any of the similarly oriented questions
submitted by other Webcast viewers, which were visible to all viewers as they streamed
across the bottom of the screen. The disenchanted consensus of the group was that McCain
was only taking “softball questions.” At least one other Webcast subscriber (not a focus
group participant) expressed the same sentiment in the same terms, as he or she wrote in
an e-mail to the Webcast that was incorporated in the video stream at the bottom of the
Senator, almost all of the questions you’ve been asked (so far) have been softball type opportunities for
you to speak without getting down to speciﬁcs. Don’t you think that your supporters that contributed
to this event want to get more details on your positions?
Civic Life Online
While most of the McCain staff responses to the Webcast viewers’ e-mails were brief but
appropriate, a staff member seemed to have misread the comment above, responding on
McCain’s behalf:
Thank you so much—I am honored by your support! (From: Staff (McCain Staff—Craig (#2)))
The McCain campaign, perhaps in an attempt to add another form of interactivity to the
Webcast, also posted a series of single-question “polls” featuring a multiple-choice question
to which subscribers could respond. Within ﬁve minutes, a bar chart of the tallied responses
from subscribers was incorporated in the Webcast stream. Questions included “How often
do you visit the McCain 2000 Web site?” (44 percent responded two to three times per
week); and “Should paying down the national debt be part of the Republican platform?”
(96 percent responded afﬁrmatively). However, the focus group participants’ response to
the online questions may cause online pollsters to shudder. They expressed great delight
in clicking on the response options they thought were least likely to be chosen by other
subscribers, and several confessed to a habit of trying to “mess up the results” of online polls
elsewhere on the Web.
Overall, the young voters in this focus group expressed desires for more creative uses
of Web-based technologies, and a more informal, playful presentation of candidates. Suggestions offered by the participants included the use of cartoons, animation, and parody
in addition to the still photos of McCain in mostly serious, formal poses. One participant
commented, “People expect funnier images on the Internet . . . they expect the Internet to
be weird and offbeat.” Other participants agreed and added suggestion such as “Let’s see
him on vacation,” and “Yeah, with his shirt off, or at least out of a suit.” The consensus
of the group was that McCain had used the Webcast like an expanded yet retrogressive TV
broadcast—incorporating e-mail and instant calculation features, but restricting visual content to “talking heads” and still photos. As one participant noted, “the Internet has a lot
more potential than what [McCain’s staff] is doing with it.”
At the end of the Webcast, the group concluded that while they appreciated the McCain
staffers’ attempts to respond at least brieﬂy to each e-mail, their one-line acknowledgements
did not constitute an “interactive” Web event. “This is not meeting John McCain,” one student said, to which another added, “If he doesn’t answer our questions, it’s not interactive.”
Comments such as these provide a detailed picture of the generational gap in expectations
and perceptions of interactivity.
Surveying the landscape of contemporary survey research on youth Web use beyond the
terrain of electoral politics, we can consider from yet another angle how “interactive” may
have a very different meaning to young people than to professional political consultants.
As discussed by others in this volume, today’s youth are well represented in online activities with content production and modiﬁcation components (e.g., see the chapters by Earl
and Schussman, Howard, Levine, and Raynes-Goldie and Walker in this volume). Within
the relevant survey data from recent years, a recurrent theme is the demand for interactive
features that allow users to exchange information of all sorts (messages, images, ﬁles) and
to generally take an active part in communicative and expressive processes. For example,
while e-mail remains the “killer app” for older Internet users, teens of today display a clear
preference for instant messaging (IM). Even more telling, younger users of IM are also signiﬁcantly more likely than older users to do things like personalize their “away messages,”
rather than simply use the standard options provided by most IM client software.21 Similar
patterns are also evident in the use of each new, and typically more interactive, element of
Not Your Father’s Internet
Web communication. Commonly referred to as “Web 2.0,” an emerging category of applications such as social networking sites, blogs, and other collaboratively authored documents
is extremely popular among young people. The dialogical and coproductive nature of the
type of interactivity manifested in these applications affords “communicative, creative, and
social uses” of the Internet—and appeals to young people.22 Indeed, in testimony to the
House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications and
the Internet, Pew researcher Amanda Lenhart summarized the appeal of social networking
sites to younger users as stemming largely from their ability to enable them to create and
share content, and to communicate through a broad variety of channels such as messaging,
blogs, and other posting mechanisms.23 Clearly, coproductive interactivity is foundational
to the way that young people, more than any other age group, engage with the Internet.
Looking at these developments within the context of sanguine hopes for the Internet as
a convenient pathway for young people toward greater participation in electoral politics
evokes mixed feelings of hope and caution. To begin with, there is clearly a signiﬁcant
demand among young people for political information online as well as for tools to engage
in a wide variety of political actions. To be sure, ofﬂine indicators of youth interest in politics
remain underwhelming, and older adults have been more likely than younger adults to vote
and to contribute to an electoral campaign or interest group. However, data on the frequency
of online political information seeking among young people suggest that their greater rates
of technology adoption may counterbalance these trends. Moreover, research on the general
characteristics of youth new media use reinforces the notion that young people turn to the
Internet not to join a passive audience for politics, but rather to seek their own audiences
and engage in active processes of creation and interaction, as Peter Levine points out in this
volume. As noted earlier, a few researchers have documented the emergence and growth of a
variety of youth-oriented political portal Web sites to meet this demand, with many offering
highly interactive and occasionally edgy political content that appears to be directly in line
with these preferences.24 However, if the rising tide of political activity on the Web is to bring
a signiﬁcant number of young people into the electoral process, political candidates and other
actors central to the online world of electoral politics need to offer content and features that
also resonate with the information seeking and sharing modes of online youth. In the next
section, we will review a variety of research on candidate Web practices that provides insights
into the extent to which candidates have met this challenge in prior elections.
Political Candidates on the Web
In 1994, Diane Feinstein launched the ﬁrst ever political Web site;25 this is sometimes referred
to as the “Kitty Hawk moment” for online political campaigning. In the election years since,
the use of the Web by political candidates has risen steadily. In the 1996 campaigns, approximately one-third of political candidates featured a campaign Web site.26 Just two years later,
the proportion nearly doubled as 63 percent of candidates took their campaigns online.27 By
the 2002 elections the proportion reached 73 percent,28 which recent research suggests may
be a plateau for online candidate campaigning, with comparable 2004 percentages hovering
around the high 60s to low-to-mid 70s.29
As a growing number of people who have produced their own Web pages know, however,
a mere presence in cyberspace does not in any way guarantee trafﬁc to one’s Web site, or
return visits from those who happen to stop by.30 In this respect, the kinds of content and
features offered on Web sites and how useful or attractive they are to visitors are important
Civic Life Online
factors. In this section, we review ﬁndings from the most comprehensive efforts to date in
tracking the content and features offered by political candidates through the Web, along
with some more recent examples that provide a glimpse of contemporary developments.
Although a few encouraging signs may be found in these data, the overarching picture is
of a signiﬁcant gap between the online sensibilities of young people and the ways in which
the vast majority of candidates for ofﬁce in the United States conduct the online portions of
their campaigns.
From August through Election Day 2002, we worked with a team of researchers to draw
samples of several hundred Web sites produced by candidates for U.S. House, Senate, and gubernatorial seats nationwide on a weekly basis for feature analysis (see Table 1). At the end of
the data collection period, all of our observations were merged into a single database, providing a detailed picture of how those at the center of electoral politics were incorporating the
Web into their campaign strategies.31 More than just a listing of features and percentages, we
believe these data provide important indicators of the shape, structure, and tendencies of the
emerging world of online political campaigning. By looking comprehensively at campaigns’
Web production practices (what candidates do, and do not do, with their campaign Web
sites) we can examine their posture toward the Web, and by extension how they might appear
to young people using the Web as an information source about campaigns and elections.
We have argued elsewhere that some features employed by campaign organizations on
their sites reﬂect the Web production practice of adapting traditional campaigning to the
Web environment.32 Providing basic information about the candidate, including background
information and issue statements, as well as managing interactions with potential supporters
both within and outside the district, are characteristic of traditional campaigning,33 whether
conducted ofﬂine or online. We operationally deﬁned this Web practice as consisting of fourteen speciﬁc features, easily recognizable as the online corollaries of traditional campaign
tools, including candidate biographies, issue statements, contact and donation information,
campaign news releases and calendars, information about voter registration, lists of endorsements, texts of speeches, information about contributors, and encouragement to write letters
to local newspaper editors.
Features and structural elements that manifest more novel, Web-speciﬁc techniques evidence a practice we have termed Web campaigning. The practice of Web campaigning is
indicated by the production of elements that may have prototypes in traditional campaigning, but are uniquely or especially catalyzed by the Web. Various scholars have attempted
to identify characteristics of the Web that differentiate it from other media channels and
environments, such as the ease with which multiple forms of media can be integrated and
disseminated, the interpenetration of consumption and production processes, and the potentially unbounded network enabled by hyperlinks,34 and we have integrated these characteristics into our concept of Web campaigning. Speciﬁcally, we conceptualized this Web
practice as manifested on campaign Web sites via ﬁfteen speciﬁc features, including linking
to other Web sites, enabling users to make contributions via the Web, providing the capability to send links to the campaign site via e-mail, provision of toolkits to facilitate Web-based
political actions, downloadable electronic campaign paraphernalia, provision of multimedia
content, interactive polls, acceptance of visitor comments, onsite delivery of letters to local
newspaper editors, interactive campaign calendars, online events, and the ability to personalize or individualize site content. Analysis of the overall prevalence of each practice showed
that campaigns were far more likely to adapt traditional campaigning to the Web than to
engage in Web campaigning.

∗N’s vary due to variations in the frequency with which different features were coded throughout the
election cycle.
Interpreting these data from the perspective of the young political information consumer,
the blunt reality is that candidates do not appear to be doing a very good job of using
the Web to reach out to those who are arguably the most likely to be receptive to political Web communication. On the upside, the data do suggest that candidates and their
campaigns appreciate the efﬁciency of using the Web to get out basic information about
themselves and their quests for ofﬁce. Biographical information and statements about various political issues were found on 92 and 90 percent of sites in our analysis, respectively.
Given that young people have demonstrated a considerable appetite for this kind of information online, this is a good sign. But if one considers interactive features more in line with
the typical Web experiences and tastes of younger voters, campaign sites come off more
as static information booths than as dynamic places to connect, create, and interact. Thus

based on our analysis of close to twelve hundred different candidate Web sites from the
2002 elections, we believe it is fair to say that many if not most campaign Web sites are
markedly skewed more toward the parents of today’s younger voters than toward youths
themselves.
As if this were not enough, additional research on a random subset of campaign sites
from 2002 has shown that even in the simple act of providing information on their issue
stances, candidates often made little effort to reach out to younger voters. In a study of the
rhetorical characteristics of candidate issue statements, Bennett and Xenos examined
the frequency with which candidate Web site issue statements featured either direct or
indirect appeals to younger voters as a group, and also the frequency with which older voters
were similarly targeted.35 The study sought to identify portions of the issue statement pages
that made age-speciﬁc appeals either through direct, textual references, or simply through
the presence of images or photos featuring younger or older people. Despite the disparities
between how likely younger versus older voters were (and are) to seek issue information
online, the study found that while candidates were comfortable reaching out to younger
voters (typically when discussing issues like education), they were more likely to reach out
to the senior demographic through their online issue materials. Even more than the relative
emphasis of candidates on certain types of features in campaign Web site design, this ﬁnding
further reinforces the impression held by many young people that candidates and politicians
simply aren’t speaking to them, even when they are using the medium of choice for the
younger generation.
Although we analyzed a smaller number of campaign sites in 2004 (one hundred) our
ﬁndings were consistent with those from 2002, reﬂecting a relative preference among campaigns to use their Web sites for providing information rather than for more interactive
practices such as involving site visitors with the campaign, connecting them with other
political actors, and mobilizing supporters to become advocates.36 In another recent study,
Conners examined the Web sites of 139 major- and third-party candidates for the U.S. Senate
in 2004,37 focusing in particular on their use of tools such as Meetup.com (a site that uses
the Web to organize ofﬂine meetings for groups of all kinds), blogs, and features facilitating
campaign involvement, such as donation and volunteering. Consistent with our data from
2002 and 2004, this study also points to relatively infrequent use of the kinds of interactive
features that young people have come to expect from online communication. Speciﬁcally,
Conners found links to Meetup.com on only 16.3 percent of Senatorial campaign Web sites
in 2004, and blogs on only 26.3 percent .
To their credit, candidates appear to be moving slowly in the direction of greater interactivity in campaign Web development, but the overarching tendency is still toward a style of
Not Your Father’s Internet
Web communication that is signiﬁcantly out of step with the tastes and preferences of most
young people seeking political information online. For example, a recent informal survey of
candidate Web sites from the most competitive 2006 Senate races suggests that while features
such as blogs and podcasts were employed on about one of three campaign sites, they were
still absent from the majority. Given that we have typically found candidates in the most
hotly contested races to be those with the most sophisticated Web sites,38 this suggests that
U.S. electoral campaigns in general are still largely reluctant to engage in more interactive
Web practices. Moreover, many of the blogs currently offered on campaign Web sites tend
to feature mostly press-release–style entries, and do not always offer users the opportunity to
comment on posts. Where commenting is enabled, it is typically restricted to those willing
to provide not only their name and e-mail address, but also, in some cases, the visitor is
required to provide even more information, such as additional contact information, along
with demographic, and issue interest information. For example, at the time of this writing,
Jim Talent’s 2006 Senate campaign Web site allowed only those willing to sign up as volunteers for the campaign (and indicate what types of volunteer activities they are willing to
perform) to comment on the site blog.39
Two Approaches to Interactivity on the Web
In the preceding sections, we have demonstrated how the Web production practices of
contemporary campaigns diverge signiﬁcantly from the tastes and expectations of younger
Internet users. Based on the best available indicators of what young people are looking
for in an electoral politics experience on the Web, and what campaign organizations are
providing, a substantial gulf is evident between them. If this gap is left unaddressed, we
believe future developments in online campaigning will fail to attract all but the most
politically oriented young voters into greater involvement with the electoral system. In the
long run, this means that the potential of new media to help reverse signiﬁcant declines
in youth political involvement may go unrealized. In the following sections, we provide
a conceptual map to help interested parties prevent such a tragic, missed opportunity. As
mentioned at the outset, the concept of interactivity is at the center of this map, and we
believe it is the key to understanding not only why candidates and young voters may be
missing each other online but also how this disconnection may be remedied. Unfortunately,
owing to the complex nature of both Internet technology and political behavior, there is no
easy solution to the problem, and so readers will not ﬁnd a simple recipe for online youth
political engagement in these pages. Rather, we hope to provide the conceptual foundation
for such efforts, and to highlight examples as well as questions that appear especially ripe
for further study and experimentation.
In many ways interactivity is the deﬁning element of Web communication. Some even
go as far as to say that interactivity and new media are synonymous.40 As such, the concept
of interactivity has received a signiﬁcant amount of attention from empirical researchers
in marketing and communication. These studies emphasize the possibility for greater levels
of interactivity present in a Web site to lead to all kinds of positive outcomes, including
greater cognitive engagement with site content, increases in the perceived favorability of site
producers, and the persuasive impact of the communication. Several studies of interactivity
and political communication through the Web have been conducted on samples of college students, a substantial portion of the youth voting demographic. For example, Sundar
et al. conducted an experiment in which three versions of a ﬁctitious political candidate
Civic Life Online
Web site were given to study participants (for each Web site, content was held constant,
while interactivity was manipulated by creating deeper and more complex levels of clickable pages).41 Consistent with the idea that young people are favorably predisposed toward
interactive site content, interactivity was shown to have a demonstrable positive impact on
college students’ perceptions of the candidate, as well as agreement with his or her issue
stances.42 In a similar study, Warnick et al. demonstrated the positive effects on college
students of two different types of interactivity found in campaign Web sites: “text-based
interactivity” consisting of features such as ﬁrst-person text and captioned photos, as well as
“campaign-to-user interactivity” consisting of features that enable two-way exchanges of information and correspondence between the user and the campaign.43 Moving beyond simple
persuasive effects on site visitors, Tedesco has also demonstrated the impact of interactivity
on college students’ feelings of political efﬁcacy, or the extent to which they felt conﬁdent
in their abilities to perform traditional citizenship roles and to trust that the political system
would be responsive to such behavior.44 After an interactive experience with political Web
content, students reported increased feelings of efﬁcacy and trust in the political system.
Clearly then, we know that in general terms the increasing prevalence and sophistication
of online campaigning stands a good chance of providing an attractive avenue to political
participation for many young adults.
But, as we have discussed in the preceding sections, campaigns tend to favor simple information distribution over interactivity in their Web production practices. Moreover, as the
McCain example illustrates, even when candidates attempt to be “interactive” the results
are not always clear-cut or positive. Existing bodies of empirical research as well as ongoing
theoretical debates reveal a variety of different dimensions to this quintessential aspect of
digital communication.45 Scholars agree that there are several variants of interactivity, even
if they do not agree on a schema for characterizing forms of interactivity. With respect to
questions about how new media are being used in the arena of electoral politics and the
extent to which such uses promote greater involvement among younger voters, however,
the speciﬁcs and outcomes of these debates are not as immediately relevant as some of the
key concepts we see represented in the world of online political campaigning. We contend
that not all forms of interactivity are as convincing or appealing to young people as site
producers would like.
Two concepts from contemporary discussions of interactivity are particularly helpful in
understanding the disconnect between young voters and candidates online. The ﬁrst of these
is the notion of interactivity as transaction between the site producer and site visitor. Although Web-based transaction can take a variety of forms, one important form is media
customization. For example, you might visit a Web site and in the course of doing so provide some basic information about yourself. In response to that information, the Web site
provides you with content tailored to the information you provided, offering you information on products you may be interested in or the weather conditions outside your home. By
reacting to information you provide (consciously or not) this form of interactivity helps to
create a custom communication experience, and like other forms is associated with positive
attitudinal outcomes.46
A second concept from scholarly discussions of interactivity that is especially useful in the
context of youth, new media, and civic engagement is that of shared control between the
producer and the collectivity of site visitors. When interactivity is approached in this way,
the content and experience of Web communication is coproduced by both users and Web
site creators. This form of interactivity can at times stand in direct tension with transaction.
Not Your Father’s Internet
At a technical level, visitor or user control simply refers to the fact that, when surﬁng the
Internet, you have a varying degree of control over what content is accessed, how it is
accessed, and so forth. While there are only a few different ways of reading the newspaper,
there are an almost unlimited number of ways you can explore the Web site of the New York
Times, and by posting a comment to a discussion board on the Times Web site, you can even
exert a small but noticeable level of control over site content. When a comment you post
is responded to by other site visitors, the result is a collaboration between the Times and
its readership in the production of the site. By applying these two concepts of interactivity
to problems of youth political engagement and online campaigning, we can begin to get
greater purchase on the generation gap in online politics.
Within the realm of online campaigning, our research and that of others suggests that
to the extent that campaign organizations are likely to further pursue interactivity, they
will do so through a carefully managed form of exchange that is manifest in transactional
techniques of Web campaigning.47 In practical terms, a transactional approach to interactivity is a preference for features that return strategic goods for the campaign while involving
a relatively small investment of resources. As strategic organizations with a concrete goal
(electoral victory), campaigns have structural imperatives to carefully manage and utilize all
resources at their disposal, and resources that may be exchanged through the Internet are
certainly no exception.
Typically, transactional techniques are achieved by creating online structures on campaign sites that facilitate the collection of personal information and contributions from
site visitors.48 For instance, one of the primary ways campaigns provide interactivity to site
visitors is through online structures that collect and manage e-mail addresses, a relatively
straightforward conduit for two-way exchange.49 Viewed through the lens of the technique
of transaction, site visitors’ e-mail addresses are more than just a way to interact. Rather, they
can also be understood as a resource that can be harvested and managed via the campaign
site when appropriate online structures are produced and conﬁgured strategically. Beyond
collecting and managing e-mail addresses, some campaign organizations have extended
their transactional capacity to build ongoing and highly personalized relationships with site
visitors. These campaigns have the capability to combine data provided intentionally and
consciously by the site visitor with additional data about the site visitor that he or she may
or may not be aware of. The visitor’s experiences on the Web site, for example, including
the frequency of page views, may be combined with data about the site visitor obtained
from outside sources, such as party registration, turnout history, contribution record, and
even purchasing patterns (from credit card company databases). These “constituent relationship management” (or CRM) systems attempt to extend to the political realm the powerful
marketing tools commonly found in the business community, with the goal of providing
relevant information to individually identiﬁed site visitors, and serving important strategic
goals, principally fundraising, and efﬁcient, effective persuasion.50
Keeping in mind the strategic imperative of campaign organizations, it is thus unsurprising
that forms of interactivity other than those that serve a clear transactional purpose are less
attractive. For example, online events such as the McCain Cyber Express Webcast, or even
less complicated features such as interactive message boards, provide little in the way of
tangible resources for campaigns, in comparison to their costs in terms of technical and staff
resources. Indeed, this cost–beneﬁt rationale is precisely what Stromer-Galley explored in her
early study of the low frequency with which campaign Web sites engage in what she termed
“human-interactive features.”51 Based on interviews with campaign staff members and an
Civic Life Online
analysis of candidate Web sites in the 1996 and 1998 elections, she concluded that, for
campaign organizations, interactive features like “direct e-mail exchanges and Web boards
were not conducive to the objective of winning an election,” and represented a style of
Web campaigning that visibly “drains resources from more pressing campaign needs.”52 In
addition, features that enable coproductive forms of interactivity, such as message boards,
multiauthored blogs, and chats, allow users to produce content directly on a campaign
site.53 Such features can also pose tangible threats to the ability of campaigns to control
their message. As a campaign professional interviewed in Howard’s study of new media
campaigning put it, “Anybody involved in a campaign. . . is always concerned about control.
Chat is difﬁcult to control.”54 Thus we see that by looking at interactivity in campaign Web
practices through the lens of transaction, some forms of interactivity (those that enable
fundraising and sophisticated targeting of persuasive messages) are more appealing than
others (those that are relatively more costly in resources and compromise efforts to control
campaign messages).
In direct contrast to the transactional approach to interactivity as a two-way exchange
(preferably one that favors the campaign organization) is the notion of interactivity as usercontrol, which is more consistent with the preferences of younger Internet users. In general,
youth tend to be suspicious of transactional relationships with campaign organizations and
favor the more coproductive elements of Internet communication. For example, in a particularly telling portion of one of the focus groups discussed earlier in which college students
participated in guided discussions of a variety of political Web sites during the 2000 campaigns, participants provided some interesting reﬂections on one of the principal ways in
which transactional interactivity is instantiated on campaign Web sites, the personalization
of site content.
I really don’t like giving them all that information. I can see all the mail that will come in a few
days. . . Even though I’m going to vote for Gore, I wouldn’t want to get a bunch of mail. I wouldn’t want
them to have all that information that they don’t need. I don’t understand why they need my address,
nor should they need my phone number for the Web page.
Another participant added the following comment:
I don’t like the idea of personalizing a political site because if I personalize it for me, how can I tell what
they are telling someone else? I like the idea of the same content and that I’m seeing what everyone else
is seeing; otherwise, they could be changing their story for someone else.
Precisely because they are among the Web’s most savvy and discerning users, younger voters
are keenly aware of the transactional nature of many popular forms of campaign interactivity. Although Howard expresses a concern that most Internet users are unaware of
some of the ways in which they are involved in transactional interactivity, these comments,
along with the greater technical sophistication of younger Internet users suggests that they
are not only aware but likely to be turned off by more transactional techniques of Web
campaigning.
Unsurprisingly, some of the most popular forms of interactivity among young people
are those that are coproductive—that is, they bring the user into the process of producing
and manipulating the content of the site. This is an important element of interactivity as
user-control, and represents what is arguably the most favored aspect of the medium for
the younger generation. As mentioned earlier, the concept of user-control has a relatively
straightforward technical meaning; by clicking, typing, accessing, and surﬁng a site the user
Not Your Father’s Internet
provides input that generates noticeable changes in output. But at a deeper level, control
is also about power. This notion of a shift in power is most strikingly seen in the kinds of
interactive activities popular among younger Internet users—when these users engage in the
“communicative, creative, and social uses” of the Internet,55 they are taking advantage of the
vastly greater level of control afforded by Web 2.0 applications, which enable them to create
their own content, and share it with others in an ongoing and multifaceted exchange. At
the same time, campaign organizations also have strategic imperatives to resist these forms
of coproductive interactivity, on the very same grounds that they shift power, and control,
away from the campaign itself.
Conclusion: Bridging the Generation Gap in Online Politics
It is hoped that through the foregoing discussion we have highlighted the need to be cautious about assuming that simply adding new media to old electoral politics will entice new
and younger voters to greater participation. At the surface, we have documented the vast
differences between the ways in which younger Internet users are accustomed to engaging
with new communications technology, and the ways in which the principal actors in the
arena of electoral politics, candidates, have been expanding their campaign operations into
cyberspace. At a deeper level, we hope we have introduced concepts that can help candidates, and the broader public, to understand the nature of these differences. In our view,
understanding the generation gap in online politics as a clash between differing notions
of interactivity clearly identiﬁes the ways in which these differences must be negotiated, if
the true potential of the Internet as a medium capable of facilitating signiﬁcant changes in
political participation among American youth is to be realized. Simply put, if greater numbers of young voters are to be attracted to the system of electoral politics through the Web,
candidates and their campaigns will need to learn how to balance the competing logics of
transactional and coproductive interactivity. A balance, rather than a wholesale embrace,
of coproduction is suggested because in the present system it is unrealistic to expect candidates to ignore the structural aspects of the electoral system that force campaigns to behave
strategically. It is also reasonable to expect that while it may not be their favored form of interactivity, young voters accept some elements of transactional activity as part of political life.
This conclusion points toward two practical ways in which Web production practices
might begin to bridge the generation gap in online politics: inclusive and transparent forms of
transactional interactivity, and creative ways of splitting the difference between transactional
and coproductive Web practices. Earlier, we pointed out that candidates in the 2002 election
cycle were more likely to use their Web campaigns to target senior rather then junior citizens.
One obvious way in which to make transactional, targeted forms of online campaigning more
attractive to younger voters is simply to address them more often. As one of the students in
the focus groups from the 2000 campaign study remarked in reference to a campaign site
menu of pages for speciﬁc groups (e.g., women, ﬁreﬁghters, Latinos), “There’s nothing wrong
with being speciﬁc if you include everyone, but if you don’t include someone then you are
going to turn them away.” In addition, it is especially important for campaigns deploying
transactional Web campaigning techniques to supply transparent statements about how
information is being collected and used by the campaign in its efforts to achieve electoral
victory. There is a general need for more campaign sites to post these kinds of statements
about their privacy policies, but the sophistication of younger Internet users suggests that
it is of particular importance if younger voters are not to be put off by candidate Web
Civic Life Online
sites in signiﬁcant numbers. To their credit, an increasing number of campaigns are already
moving in this direction, offering speciﬁc pages and materials targeted to young voters and
providing clear statements about the privacy policies of the campaign. However, we believe
further effort in these areas is needed if more young citizens are to be drawn into electoral
politics through online campaigns.
With respect to creatively splitting the difference between transactional and coproductive
forms of interactivity, there are also some fortunate (although all too rare) examples that help
to illustrate the point. Perhaps the most famous example is that of the Howard Dean campaign’s innovative and remarkable deployment of new media during the 2004 democratic
presidential primary. In their study of the Dean campaign, Iozzi and Bennett document the
ways in which many of its techniques represented a pioneering qualitative shift in American
campaigning away from the traditional “War Room” style (which places a premium on message control) and toward a more ﬂuid and dynamic “networked” style of campaigning.56 In
doing so, the campaign was able to realize tangible beneﬁts from coproductive interactivity
in return for modest compromises in message control. Less extreme (and less risky from the
perspective of traditional campaigns) examples of creative compromise between competing
forms of interactivity may be found in some of the Web campaigns for the 2006 elections.
For example, on Rick Santorum’s 2006 Senate campaign Web site, a “Running with Rick”
campaign blog was offered, complete with comment functions.57 Perhaps as a way of counterbalancing the costs of this coproductive element (in campaign staff and possible risks),
however, when a user clicked on the “comment” button beneath each blog entry, they were
directed to a registration page for the site, which asked for pieces of personal information,
along with whether one identiﬁed with one of twenty different “coalitions,” which included
“youth” and “young professional” alongside more traditional groupings such as “seniors”
and “women.”58 Another example from 2006 was the Bob Menendez for Senate campaign
site, which in addition to the ofﬁcial campaign blog featured “diaries” or other Web logs
created by individuals.59 Similarly to the Santorum site, the Menendez site required would-be
campaign bloggers to register with the site (i.e., provide the campaign with a useful informational resource). But once registered, the user was offered their own venue for creating and
sharing content with others.60
To be sure, these examples are certainly not ﬂawless from the perspective of the average
young Internet user who may be curious about the campaigns. Moreover, the extent to
which the coproductive elements in the immediately preceding examples were ﬁltered and
managed by the campaigns is unclear, potentially creating only more sophisticated, Web 2.0
versions of the McCain Cyber Express Webcast. Indeed, if opportunities for coproduction are
only displayed for effect, and youthful voices and nonsoftball questions are systematically
avoided, then there is a distinct possibility that such efforts will be for naught. To paraphrase
one of the youth focus group participants quoted earlier, such efforts may come off as no
better than poor-quality MP3 ﬁles, or worse, broken or virus-ridden MP3 ﬁles. However, on
a more positive note, if young voters’ voices are represented in experiments such as these,
and the coproduction opportunities offered are genuine, then our research suggests that
younger citizens curious about the campaigns will be more likely to linger on the sites, send
their links to friends in their social networks, and begin to engage with a system that their
demographic group has been disengaged from for a considerable period. To be sure, more
research and experimentation in this vein are needed in order to ﬁnd the optimal mix of
features required to satisfy both the strategic demands of campaigns and the social good of
simulating greater numbers of young people to participate in the electoral system. But we
believe it is essentially through the negotiation of these competing forms of interactivity
Not Your Father’s Internet
that political practice on the Web must pass if the generation gap in online politics is to be
effectively bridged.

This petition is to request that the Backstreet Boys come to Asia for a tour. They haven’t been on a
tour in Asia (besides China & Japan) in almost 9 years.
The Backstreet Boys have numerous fans in Asia, who have been supporting them throughout
their haitus [sic] & now, their new album & singles.
We are sick of reading about the boys touring Japan only. Yes, we know they toured China too,
but that was only late last year. It’s not as if Japan represents the whole of Asia!
Please let the Backstreet Boys tour Asia. At least a concert . . . please?
Petition number 211
A lot of kids don’t get home from school in time to watch [programs on the Disney Channel].
I would like to start a Web site that would allow viewers to download episodes of the Disney
Classics and of the newer Disney Channel shows at an earlier time. . . . However, I may have to get
copyright permission to let viewers download tv shows from my Web site legally. You know what
might increase the chances of me getting copyright permission? A lot of people signing this petition.
The more signatures I have (especially if I have several hundred or several thousand signatures) the
more apt the ofﬁcials might be to give me copyright permission to let me let viewers download
episodes from my Web site.

Introduction
The above petition examples are illustrative of an online trend: using traditional social movement tactics, such as petitions, on the Internet to support, contest, or otherwise comment
on cultural products and celebrities. Other petitions range from those seeking to address
perceived problems in massively multiplayer online games such as World of Warcraft to
petitions advocating for the open-source release of popular software to still other petitions
that call on bands to share their concert recordings with fans. What this broad range of
petitions has in common is a central focus on concerns that are important to youth culture
and popular culture more broadly.
We would like to extend our deep thanks, and a public acknowledgment, to the operators of PetitionOnline, particularly Kevin Matthews and Mike Wheeler, who provided us with raw data for use in
this chapter. We would also like to thank Lance Bennett and the other volume contributors for their
lively exchanges and comments on this chapter.
Civic Life Online
However, many adults and nonenthusiasts approach these petitions with skepticism: are
these petitions serious, and can they be thought of as politically oriented, or even civically
oriented, in any way? In this chapter, we argue that, far from being exotic or marginal,
such petitions are increasingly common online. Furthermore, we contend that this kind
of petition is a predictable outgrowth of the convergence between “movement societies”
and the affordances of digital technologies. As discussed in more detail below, movement
society theorists assert that in many Western democracies, social movement schemas and
practices (i.e., ways of understanding and acting in the world) have become so institutionalized that they are now part and parcel of everyday life.1 Instead of ruptures in the
political process, social movement tactics such as petitioning make up the fabric of everyday citizen politics in movement societies. Affordances of the Internet include markedly
dropping costs of producing material online—including petitions—and the ability to easily
and cheaply modify many types of cultural products—from mashups (i.e., the overlaying
of multiple albums or music tracks into a single hybrid work of music) to e-books. These
trends may have important implications for how consumers (and young consumers in particular) understand their relationship with cultural producers, be they corporations, artists,
or celebrities.
In fact, we argue that what may seem like clearly nonpolitical acts—petitioning about the
Backstreet Boys on the Internet, for instance—are actually an indicator of deeper transformations surrounding cultural consumption and civic engagement. Speciﬁcally, we maintain
that a notable share of what we argue to be civic engagement—especially on the part of
youth or with regard to youth-oriented issues—involves cultural contestation that may or
may not eventually involve the state, which is a signiﬁcant departure from a conventional
understanding of social movements as state-directed challenges.2
Furthermore, enabled by digital technology, consumers are engaging with the producers and owners of cultural products, staking a new kind of claim to those materials. As we
will illustrate, online protest surrounding cultural products suggests a redeﬁnition of longstanding relationships between consumers and producers in which consumers are becoming
much more active and (literally) demanding more from producers. This redeﬁnition is highly
salient to young participants who are developing repertoires of contention that may shape
later civic engagement.
This chapter will explore this emerging form of engagement by empirically tracing the
outlines of one speciﬁc area in which cultural contestation is visible: the proliferation of
online petitions contesting cultural concerns. After reviewing the literature that informs our
approach, we provide an overview of culture-related online petition material to argue that
(1) these petitions are not marginal sideshows; (2) these petitions tend to focus on products and industries associated with youth culture; and (3) many of the petitions represent
consumer-based contestation. We also discuss potential implications of these processes for
future research on online-enabled protest; we discuss how cultural contestation might be
transformed into more state-oriented battles over cultural ownership and intellectual property; and we discuss approaches to civic engagement likely to be adopted increasingly by
young people.
Civic Engagement in the Digital Age
Before trying to make sense of youth-culture petitions, it is useful to situate these petitions
within the wider terrain of civic engagement. As noted elsewhere in this volume, attention

to civic engagement often comes in the form of concern about and debate over rising or
falling levels of social ties, community connectedness, and electoral participation. Most
assessments of these trends rely on formal deﬁnitions of civic engagement that focus heavily
on explicitly political visions of civic engagement (e.g., research examining the relationship
between social networks, voting trends, and protest participation). In fact, there is often
only a thin distinction between political engagement and civic engagement, given that
the activities that comprise civic engagement are marked by their institutional relationship
to government (e.g., voting), or their noninstitutional relationship to government (e.g.,
protest).3 To the extent that civic engagement has been more broadly understood to include
volunteering and community service of other types, the focus has been on community
activity that seemed expressly related to a sense of a community as a body politic.
But, increasingly corporations and other private entities are having identiﬁable, powerful,
and contested roles in the everyday lives of citizens. Instead of channeling discontent about
these effects solely toward governments as regulators, many are protesting against corporations themselves in hopes of directly changing corporate policies or products.4 We argue that
in a society where nongovernmental bodies wield so much obvious inﬂuence—whether at
the global geopolitical level or in daily lived experience—it is important to reconsider protest
against these bodies as a meaningful way of becoming civically engaged.
Thus, far from adding to a sense of crisis over an alleged paucity of civic engagement by
youth, we step back and try to draw attention to ways in which younger citizens are engaging
with issues that they ﬁnd important and relevant to their lives, however removed these
activities may seem from classic visions of civic engagement. Speciﬁcally, we draw attention
to the ways in which younger citizens are focusing on nontraditional concerns—particularly
more cultural concerns—using traditional methods of civic engagement such as petitioning.
In taking this approach, we are arguing that before certifying a crisis of civic engagement,
one must ask whether existing notions of what comprises civic engagement tend to ignore,
devalue, or otherwise marginalize ways in which younger citizens are connecting with one
another to collectively make a difference in their own worlds. Culturally oriented concerns
tend to be devalued, as shown by the skeptical reaction of many to the example petitions
that opened this chapter. This devaluation has also been observed by Coleman, whose research compares attitudes of political enthusiasts to fans of Big Brother.5 As Coleman points
out, a consequence of such skepticism is the narrowing of what is considered worthwhile
engagement: “Ofﬁcial strictures about what constitutes respectable (and respect-worthy) political participation have the effect of narrowing the repertoire of political citizenship.”6 In
suggesting that adults more seriously consider the ways in which youth may be redeﬁning
civic engagement, we join other authors from this volume, including Coleman and Raynes-
Goldie and Walker. And, in our case, the informality and relatively un-“managed” style of
the petitions may even be one reason this kind of engagement is appealing to youth, as
suggested in Bers’s and Xenos and Foot’s arguments in this volume about the unappealing
nature of highly managed media experiences to youth.
In addition, we argue that marginalizing and ignoring these activities causes us to risk
missing a harbinger of potentially deep changes in the role of consumers. As we argue in
more detail below, the relationship between consumers and producers is being remade in
the digital age such that consumers are increasingly challenging the authority and judgment
of producers. No longer content to passively wait for products to come to market, or to have
products updated, ﬁxed, or improved, consumers are increasingly challenging producers’
longstanding autonomy. In a world where corporations—and the goods and services that
Civic Life Online
they produce—matter so much to daily life, we argue that it is useful to expand notions of
civic engagement to include cultural contestation that attempts to redeﬁne the relationship
between corporations and consumers of their products.
Speciﬁcally, we argue that the conﬂuence of a movement society and contention over
culture and cultural ownership is a new venue for making sense of civic engagement, one
that suggests that civic engagement may not look like what we have tended to expect. It is
not formal—facilitated through well-established community organizations, activist groups,
or political parties—and it may not even be conscientiously understood as engagement, but
instead as a seemingly natural aspect of using or watching or gaming. We argue that it is
important to trace empirically this kind of cultural contestation—which we do by studying
online petitions about entertainment-related issues—and to try to understand the context in
which this activity is occurring, which is the subject of the next two sections of the chapter.
Movement Societies: Protest as Part of Everyday Life
Historically used as a way to notify the ruler of subjects’ concerns, and eventually as an
avenue for raising citizens’ grievances with legislators, petitions have long served as a forum
for airing problems and seeking redress.7 For instance, according to an interesting history
of petitioning by Zaeske, petitions were a major venue for pressing for abolition when legislators tried to ignore concerns about slavery. However, while social movement scholars
are increasingly attending to the often central role of cultural contestation in social movement struggles—such as struggles over language, media, and collective identities8—petitions
have not previously been vehicles for much of that protest.9 Social movement research
can, nonetheless, leverage our understanding of entertainment-related petitioning through
consideration of movement society arguments.
As social movements and protest have become increasingly institutionalized forms of political participation in Western democracies, scholars have begun to discuss the growth of
movement societies.10 In movement societies, a large and diverse population of actors uses
forms of discourse and political involvement whose heritage can be traced directly back to
social movements.11 Unprecedented levels of diffusion of social movement discourse and
tactics are characteristic of such institutionalization and may become so substantial that the
forms of social action pioneered by social movements begin to pervade civic engagement and
seemingly apolitical areas of life. For instance, classic protest tactics—such as petitioning—
may be adopted by groups that had only used other forms of political participation before
(e.g., only engaged in campaigning and voting before) and/or for purposes that seem distant
from the protest heritage of petitioning. Movement society proponents argue that protest
schemas and practices are becoming embedded in everyday life in some Western democracies. When this happens, people begin to understand their problems through the kinds of
collective lenses that have been integral to classic social movements, and may begin to apply
classic social movement practices, such as protest, to resolve their troubles.
Given this shift toward movement societies, at least in many Western industrialized states,
we expect that new kinds of grievances—including grievances about products and celebrities,
and more broadly about what we are referring to as grievances about cultural control—will
be expressed using protest tactics that are now well-institutionalized means of engaging in
collective conﬂict. Recent research conducted by Earl and Kimport on a quasi-random sample
of Web sites discussing petitions, boycotts, and letter-writing and e-mail campaigns conﬁrm
these expectations.12
Contesting Cultural Control
Earl and Kimport found that about 10 percent of online protest actions were focused on
“nonstandard” claims, including entertainment-related claims like the ones discussed here.
They also found claims that featured new combinations of individual and collective interests
and action. Speciﬁcally, they found online protest actions attempting to address individual
grievances with collective action, collective grievances with individual action, and individual
grievances with individual action.
However, since their data set only had a small number of protest actions on these types
of nonstandard causes, Earl and Kimport were not able to thoroughly outline these developments. We add to their initial contribution by examining a sample of petitions that we
expect to be wholly focused on entertainment-related claims, which will allow us to dig even
more deeply into movement society dynamics.
Affordances of Internet Technologies
We also make two arguments about the affordances of Internet, and digital technologies more
broadly: (1) the online production of protest activities—such as online petition hosting—
has dramatically reduced the costs of organizing collective actions, which has accelerated
the growth of movement societies; and (2) digital technologies afford capacities to easily
and cheaply change, recombine, and otherwise entirely reshape cultural products, which we
argue is leading to more extensive changes in the roles of consumers and producers.
Making It on the Cheap
Research on a variety of different types of protest, social movements, and collective action
has demonstrated that lower organizing and production costs seem to be a general affordance
of Internet technologies.13 Relevant to this chapter, it is much less expensive to create an
online petition than it is to create and run an ofﬂine petition drive. In an ofﬂine petition
drive, one would have to create the petition, get it printed in sufﬁcient quantities (which
can be expensive), and then either recruit volunteers or hire paid signature gatherers to go
out to large public spaces to collect signatures.
In contrast, with sites like PetitionOnline (discussed further below), which offers free
online petition setup and hosting, online petitioning can be quite easy and inexpensive to
start and manage. Even users with fairly remedial computer skills can open a Web browser
and ﬁll out a Web-based form to create a petition. They can then send links to the petition
to a wide variety of potentially interested parties and let the back-end software manage the
signatures as they come in.
Research also suggests that the lowest organizing and production costs for protest or other
forms of collective action are achieved when a movement emerges online and then stays
online, instead of emerging ofﬂine and migrating online. Earl and Schussman call these fully
online movements “e-movements.”14 Illustratively, in Earl and Schussman’s research on the
strategic voting e-movement, the authors identiﬁed an online organizer who put a notice
on his Web site saying he did not need any donations (some people had clearly offered to
donate to him) because operating his Web site was so inexpensive. It is difﬁcult to imagine
Amnesty International posting a sign indicating that donations are not needed!
There is a wide array of potential consequences for this change in the cost structure of
starting and maintaining protest actions online.15 Particularly relevant, though, is Earl’s
argument that the low cost of producing protest actions online (see below) should accelerate movement society trends.16 She argues that very low organizing costs allow people to
Civic Life Online
organize around issues that have never before (or at least rarely) been the subject of protest
organizing. Put differently, the cost restriction that may have prevented people from applying traditional social movement schemas and practices to some cultural issues can be
removed by Internet technologies. Earl and Kimport’s research bears out this claim, showing
that the low-cost production of protest facilitated by the Internet has allowed a variety of
inexpensive petition and letter-writing campaigns to develop around entertainment-related
We are interested in how this cost structure affects the way young people use the Internet
to engage in issues that seem relevant and important to their everyday lives. If young people
are growing up in movement societies, where scripts and practices from social movements
have become part of everyday thinking, and where producing online protest actions has
become extremely inexpensive, then we should expect that young people will begin to use
online protest-organizing tools to mount protests about issues they care about. As the next
section argues, one set of issues that is likely to be proximate to many teenagers’ and young
adults’ lives involves the cultural products and personalities that make up “youth culture”
or “popular culture” more broadly.
Using, Making, and Owning Culture
As noted above, digital technologies have helped transform audiences into producers. Where
digital media are concerned, inexpensive digital cameras, inexpensive but powerful videoediting software, and video-sharing services like OurMedia and YouTube allow everyday
people to become ﬁlmmakers and distributors. This latter aspect is particularly important
because it allows users to easily and widely spread home movies, amateur ﬁlms, video clips,
and music videos. Previously, this would have required users to have large amounts of their
own storage and bandwidth, but YouTube users simply need to upload their digital movie
ﬁles and then share the Web location; the service handles the storage and bandwidth for
distribution. As the tools to make and edit music, video, and images become more and more
accessible, these activities will continue to proliferate, a point that is developed more fully
in Rheingold’s discussion of participatory media in this volume.
Not only have digital technologies made it easier for everyday, “garage” cultural production to occur but digital media also make it easy to modify existing digital products,
exempliﬁed by mashups. One of the most well-known mashups was the “Grey Album,”
made by combining samples from the Beatles’ “White Album” with the vocals from rapper Jay-Z’s “Black Album.” The Village Voice named the album one of the top ten records
of 2004, but more recognition came when the owners of the Beatles’ catalog cracked
down over copyright infringements. Activists used the opportunity to highlight what they
saw as overly restrictive copyright policies. As Howard-Spink notes, mashups signify an
important role for amateurs and consumers: consumer participation in a culture where
“the struggle for power over meaning-making has been concentrated in fewer and fewer
Massively multiplayer online games similarly seem to typify this potential for transforming
relationships between products and consumers. In online worlds such as Second Life or World
of Warcraft, players accumulate wealth, build on their own digital property, and engage in
longitudinal campaigns with in-game alter egos. But they have an ownership in the game
world that is more than symbolic, sometimes paying real money for rare in-game artifacts or
abilities. Some stake further claims to their digital domains by petitioning game producers
for enhancements and bug ﬁxes.
Contesting Cultural Control
Scholars have begun to consider the implications of these phenomena. Benkler discusses
how a networked information economy, in which cultural goods are primarily digitally
produced and distributed, has a profound effect on contemporary culture.19 He considers
collaborative platforms (e.g., Wikipedia and massively multiplayer online games) and more
nominally individual activities (e.g., posting photos to the photo-sharing site Flickr), arguing
that these platforms facilitate the “appropriation of media content for the purpose of commentary, annotation, and innovation” that Jack Balkin calls “glomming on.”20 Consumers
are now empowered to participate in a new kind of “folk culture” that stands in sharp contrast to the “highly choreographed cultural production system of the industrial information
economy.”21 Benkler writes that this form of engagement with cultural products means an
important transformation in our understanding of culture’s role in society:22
This plasticity, and the practices of writing your own culture, then feed back into the transparency, both
because the practice of making one’s own music, movie, or essay makes one a more self-conscious user
of the cultural artifacts of others, and because in retelling anew known stories, we again come to see
what the originals were about and how they do, or do not, ﬁt our own sense of how things are and how
they ought to be. There is emerging a broad practice of learning by doing that makes the entire society
more effective readers and writers of their own culture.23
Jenkins speaks similarly of these transformations, identifying the power found in “writing
over [culture], modding it, amending it, expanding it, adding greater diversity of perspective,
and then recirculating it.”24 But Jenkins goes further to argue that such developments, taking
place as they are “in the afﬁnity spaces that are emerging around popular culture,”25 are
particularly relevant and important to young people who need to learn how to participate
in “the deliberations over what issues matter, what knowledge counts, and what ways of
knowing command authority and respect.”26
Existing information indeed suggests that young people may be a particularly important
segment of the population for whom the relationship between consumption and culture
is changing. As Rheingold discusses elsewhere in this volume, youth are far from passive
when it comes to consumerism: young people in the United States are both highly wired
(87 percent of teens between twelve and seventeen are online) and have a seeming naturalness with reappropriating and remaking cultural products that is attendant with coming
of age surrounded by media and media technologies. Furthermore, data from the WebUse
survey of college students suggests that a large fraction of young people are doing creative
things online: close to 27 percent of surveyed students report making music, while almost
22 percent report writing ﬁction or poetry.27 Much higher percentages of respondents report
daily or weekly use of online services to download or listen to music (78 percent), download
or watch videos (58 percent), or browse online photo albums (57 percent). The explosion in
popularity (and attendant controversy) of the MySpace service, where the majority of users
are between fourteen and twenty-four,28 further suggests that online public spaces—where
users post photos and comments and share music, for example—constitute especially important avenues for young people. Chapters by Montgomery and Raynes-Goldie and Walker
in this volume also discuss the youth focus of MySpace (and the adult concern prompted by
that focus).
If we are correct that consumership is changing at the same time that protest organizing
costs are dropping and people are thinking of using protest practices to solve their problems,
then we would expect to ﬁnd cultural contestation through collective action, thereby also
contributing weight to Scammel’s broader argument that “consumer critique is fundamental
Civic Life Online
to citizenship in the age of globalization.”29 Anecdotes such as fan-led campaigns to “Save
Fireﬂy” being instrumental in the production of the ﬁlm Serenity, for example, suggest this is
the case. Our chapter moves beyond anecdotes to a more systematic empirical examination.
In what follows, we consider how the rise of a movement society makes these instances of
collective action more than an aberration on the part of fans or fanatics, but rather a part
of an increasingly standard repertoire of action, used by savvy consumers as a seemingly
natural way to shape the worlds of culture in which they participate.
Data and Methods
In order to study how contestation around youth culture may be taking shape through
online petitions, we examine a large, random sample of online petitions targeted around
entertainment concerns. Speciﬁcally, our data are drawn from a 5 percent sample of the
12,848 petitions that were included in the entertainment category on PetitionOnline30 in
June 2006. PetitionOnline is a free online petition-hosting Web site where individuals can
use the site’s software and servers to create, host, and manage a petition on any subject. Over
time, the site has housed tens of thousands of petitions and collected more than 33 million
signatures.31
This site was selected for several reasons. First, it is one of the largest and most popular
petition-hosting sites online, allowing access to a wide variety of petitions on a large number
of topics. Second, prior research suggests that so-called warehouse sites32 like PetitionOnline,
which house online protest actions for others, are important centers for organizing on nonstandard issues.33 Thus, data from this site will allow us to paint a vivid and deep portrait of
online petitioning on nonstandard subjects.
The site allows access to an overall list of active petitions, a searchable list of active petitions,
a list of the top twenty-ﬁve petitions (in terms of signatures) from the previous day, and lists of
petitions by category. Categories include “Politics & Government—International,” “Politics
& Government—USA,” “Politics & Government—State,” “Politics & Government—Local,”
“Environment,” “Religion,” “Technology & Business,” and “Entertainment & Media.”
We focus here on petitions categorized as “Entertainment & Media” petitions in an effort
to showcase and make sense of the outcropping of youth-culture petitions that can be
found on the Internet. It is important to note that our data do not allow us to directly
establish the age of either petition authors or petition signers as we collect data on the
petitions themselves, not their authors or signers (on whom data was not available). However,
we strongly argue it is reasonable to assume that many, if not most, of the youth-culture
petitioning we observed was undertaken by youth. Our argument is based on several grounds:
(1) data we reviewed here suggests that youth are far more likely to be the consumers of the
products and celebrities discussed in the petitions we study and have been statistically more
common producers of similar online content; (2) consumer distribution makes it more likely
that youth, versus other age groups, will engage in contestation over the products found in
the entertainment and media sections of sites such as PetitionOnline (e.g., later we discuss
the difference between petitions on video games versus Microsoft Ofﬁce products); and (3)
a reasonable reading of the actual text of many petitions also strongly suggests younger
authors (i.e., the look and the feel of the petitions is suggestive of youth authoring).
In order to gather data on these youth-culture, and likely youth-authored, petitions, we
collected data from PetitionOnline in June 2006. At that time, there were 12,848 petitions on
the list of active petitions34 available when Web site visitors clicked on the “Entertainment
Contesting Cultural Control
& Media” link. We randomly sampled from this list at a 5 percent rate, yielding 642 sampled
petitions. We then used freely available mirroring software to download the content of each
petition from PetitionOnline.
We were also provided raw data, based on data that appeared publicly on PetitionOnline,
by the operators of PetitionOnline. These data covered all petitions housed within the Entertainment category, and we extracted from that larger set the data on the 642 petitions we had
sampled and mirrored. Data provided by PetitionOnline included whether a “community
support” constituency (i.e., a set of people expected to support the petition) was indicated
by the petition creator, preferred characteristics for potential signers that were listed by petition creators, whether or not the names of signers were displayed on PetitionOnline, what
country and/or U.S. state (if any) the petition focused on, the listed target(s) of the petition,
and the total number of signers as of the date the data was provided in July 2006.
These data were imported into a statistical package and variables were content coded to
create categorical values out of the free text data, as depicted in tables and ﬁgures in the
Findings section.35 All results below exclude the seventy-eight petitions from our sample
that were not in English and were therefore not coded, meaning that results shown below
are based on a maximum of 564 petitions (the number of petitions is sometimes lower
because of missing data or nonresponses on the petition startup form).
Furthermore, the actual petition text, which was mirrored from PetitionOnline, was manually content coded to determine what kinds of claims were made in the petition text, what
types of industries and products were targeted in the text of petitions (separate from the
target listed in the data provided by PetitionOnline), and how the petition labeled potential signers (e.g., “fans of WWE”). In all cases, data were coded by one of the two authors
and postcoding checks for invalid values were completed. Using these data, we are able to
paint a vivid portrait of online petitioning around youth-culture issues, as the next section
demonstrates.
Describing Youth-Culture Online Petitioning
Data from PetitionOnline demonstrate four clear empirical points. First, they challenge the
assumption that entertainment-related petitioning is a marginal activity in terms of prevalence, participation, reach, or impact. Where prevalence is concerned, the overall volume of
entertainment-related petitions is itself impressive: on the day in June 2006 on which we
sampled petitions, there were an astounding 12,848 petitions shown in the Entertainment
& Media category. Only petitions signed within the last thirty days and with ten or more
signatures are displayed in the category sections on PetitionOnline, so the 12,848 ﬁgure actually understates the total number of active entertainment-related petitions housed on the
site. Data provided by PetitionOnline that include petitions with fewer than ten signatures
indicate that there were 21,251 entertainment petitions in July of 2006. It is difﬁcult to cast
such a large volume of online petitions as a truly marginal activity.
Another way to consider prevalence is in relation to the number of petitions hosted by
PetitionOnline in other categories. As mentioned above, PetitionOnline allows petitions
to be assigned to one of eight categorical groupings. In November 2006 we returned to
PetitionOnline and recounted the active Entertainment & Media petitions. In the months
between June, when we sampled petitions from the site, and November, the Entertainment & Media category continued to grow: there were 14,395 active Entertainment & Media
petitions in November. This was by far the largest of the eight categories at that time. In order

of size, from next largest to smallest, the other categories were: “Politics & Government—
International” with 3,470 active petitions; “Politics & Government—Local” with 2,687 active petitions; “Technology & Business” with 2,478 petitions; “Politics & Government—
USA” with 2,208 active petitions; “Environment” with 1,379 active petitions; “Politics &
Government—State” with 1,336 active petitions; and “Religion” with 662 active petitions.
Given that the Entertainment & Media category hosts more than four times as many active
petitions as the next largest category on PetitionOnline, there is evidence of strong interest
in cultural concerns.
Participation is also impressive. Of the 642 petitions we randomly sampled in June, the
mean number of participants was 965, the median was 143 participants, and the maximum
was 81,260 signers. The bottom 25 percent of petitions in our sample still had up to thirtyseven signers, and the top 25 percent had 528 signers or more. Thus, in terms of sheer
participation, it is difﬁcult to cast these petitions as marginal.36
We also coded data on any geographic focus of the petitions, as indicated by petition
creators when they registered with PetitionOnline. Although the majority of petition creators indicated no geographic focus, those that did have a geographic focus conﬁrm that
petitions nearly blanket the globe. As Figure 1 indicates, the majority of petitions in which
authors indicated a geographic location were located in North America or Europe. Nonetheless, entertainment-related petitions focusing on Central and South America, the Middle
East, Eastern Europe, East Asia, and Australia were also found in our sample. This suggests
that, although entertainment-related petitions on PetitionOnline were largely American or
European, the sample of petitions still had global reach and thus cannot be seen as extremely
geographically conﬁned, and hence marginal, activity.
This sense of a global reach is also supported by data we collected on second languages used
in petitions. While we only coded petitions that were written in English, some petitions were
Contesting Cultural Control
written in both English and a second language. Data on those additional languages show
that petitions were translated into Spanish, German, Portuguese, French, and even Maori.37
Although we lack systematic data on the outcomes of these petitions, we do have access
to some anecdotal reports, as published on the PetitionOnline Web site, that document
corporate reactions to these petitions. For instance, in one reaction recently featured on the
Web site, a WebTV vice president wrote to express his concern for the customer complaints
aired in the online petition that garnered fewer than a thousand signatures.38 The ofﬁcial
provided a detailed account of the ways in which WebTV was trying to resolve the set
of customer complaints from the petition, including setting up special customer response
teams and an ombudsperson e-mail address, among other responses. In other cases, “revival”
movements attempted to bring particular programs back on air. While it can be hard to
determine what role the petitions we studied play in corporate decisions to bring programs
back, the goals of these groups are sometimes clearly achieved. For instance, a petition signed
by just 592 fans of a canceled program was submitted, and shortly after the submission of
the petition, the program was brought back.39 Thus, there is some evidence that even smaller
petitions still may affect their corporate targets.
Youth-Cultural Focus
Furthermore, data on the content of petitions convincingly demonstrate that these petitions
tend to focus on products and industries associated with youth culture. Figure 2 shows what
industries were discussed in petitions. Television tops the charts with 27.8 percent of our
sampled petitions. Music (20.2 percent) and video games (17.2 percent) followed. When
one looks at speciﬁc products discussed, as shown in Figure 3, television and TV shows
(22.3 percent), singers and bands, or music generally, (21.3 percent), and video games (16.7
percent) are also major foci of attention.40 For example, petitions frequently sought to bring
bands—ranging from Evanescence to Asian boy band sensations—in concert to speciﬁc cities
or countries, or encouraged game publishers to make sequels to popular video games. One
such music petition, addressed to record company Sony BMG, read:
After hearing the news that YG Entertainment will be having a worldwide tour in celebration of their
10th Year Anniversary, I would like to gather those living in the states of Australia to sign a petition for
YG Entertainment to bring their tour to this country. (Petition number 158)
Another petition was addressed to video game publisher Ubisoft:
Beyond Good & Evil—one of the greatest games in modern history and one of the few games that
actually needs a sequel. It’s a shame that the game didn’t sell better, but with your help there may be
a chance for us to get some attention and convince Ubisoft that they would be making a huge mistake
not releasing a sequel. Sign up now to show your support and tell all your Jade-loving friends about this
petition. (Petition number 201)
When one compares speciﬁc categories—like the prevalence of petitions on nongame software versus that of video games—the youth focus of these petitions becomes even clearer.
Put bluntly, the petitions we analyzed were not predominately about whether Microsoft Access or PowerPoint should be updated (a decidedly non–youth-oriented set of concerns), but
were instead about whether Halo was challenging enough. In fact, petitions about Microsoft
Ofﬁce products did exist on PetitionOnline but tended to be housed in the “Technology &
Business” category. Instead, the petitions we examined called for such things as the publisher of World of Warcraft to ﬁx “ridiculous downtime, unstable, laggy uptime and sub-par
customer service.”41 Petitioners, who cast themselves as loyal fans, asserted that they face so

much “pain and frustration” from the problems with the game. They saw their concerns as
not only important for their own gaming experience, but important enough to make known
to the game’s producers.
Table 1 shows a breakdown of the explicit targets of petitions. Data were coded from
information petition creators provided when they started a petition. Results provide powerful
additional support for the youth-culture focus of these petitions, as shown by the substantial
percentage of petitions that targeted entertainment-related companies, industry groups, or
company representatives for such ﬁrms. Not surprisingly, given results from the prior section,
companies that produce ﬁlm, TV, video, and video games were primary targets. For instance,
one petition implored:
As fans of college baseball and college universities, we politely ask EA Sports to either make a patch
including more NCAA baseball conferences for MVP NCAA Baseball 06 or to include them all in NCAA
Baseball 07. (Petition number 383)
The content of petitions on other market segments, such as athletics, also suggested a
strong youth-focus. For instance, several of the “sports/athletics” petitions were focused on
wrestling. One such petition read:
To: World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.
The fans of sports entertainment, are banding together and are pleaing [sic] with the powers to be at
World Wrestling Entertainment, to induct Eddie Guerrero as a member of the 2006 Hall of Fame in
Chicago during Wrestle Mania 22. (Petition number 552)

Not to be lost among the ﬁndings shown in Table 1 is a major trend: the vast majority
of targets in entertainment-related petitions were corporations (or their representatives),
artists and celebrities, and other individuals and private groups. Government, however, was
almost absent—quite conspicuously so—with fewer than 4 percent of petitions including
a government target at all. Of course, this does not mean that only 4 percent of all online
petitions target the government, but among petitions in the Entertainment & Media category,
government was seldom seen as an appropriate target.42

Table 2 provides data on the speciﬁc concerns, or claims made, in these petitions. Legal issues such as copyright or intellectual property, or law and government policy more
generally, were rarely of concern: only about 2.5 percent of petitions focused on these
issues. Instead, Table 2 shows that petitions tended to make claims in support of or opposition to products and celebrities, request changes to products, or voice concern about
pricing and/or customer service. For instance, 17 percent of petitions were “revival oriented.” These petitions usually sought to bring television programs such as American Dreams
back to broadcast or tried to persuade record companies to release recordings of live concert
performances.
Similar to this type of claim were claims about “saving” products, meaning that a product
had not yet been cancelled but was at risk. About 8 percent of petitions we coded made such
claims, which often sought to keep canceled TV shows such as Conviction on the air. Petitions
in this category were by no means limited to television, however; they sought to save radio
stations, video games, or music venues.43
In stark contrast to supportive petitions, roughly 12 percent expressed opposition to particular products or celebrities. Sports-related petitions in this category were not uncommon:
one petition argued that the owner of the Baltimore Orioles had hurt the team and should
no longer control the franchise. Another sought to have English soccer star David James
dropped from the roster after too many “clangers.”44
Between these two poles were generally supportive petitions that sought to support celebrities and products in some way (6.7 percent) and petitions that wanted greater promotion
for products or celebrities (3.5 percent). One of these petitions sought to persuade MTV to
broadcast more programming about the Backstreet Boys45 while another expressed support
for Ashlee Simpson after the singer had an embarrassing live performance on Saturday Night
Twenty-one percent of petitions requested an addition or an expansion to a product.
Petitions sought to see the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame expanded, to bring Pearl Jam in
concert to Columbia or No Doubt to play a show in Brazil, and to add a video screen to a

municipal concert venue. About 14 percent of petitions featured claims that did not postulate
a speciﬁc problem with a product but nonetheless wanted a modiﬁcation that did not clearly
involve other coded types of change. One petition, for example, advocated casting Lucy
Lawless in the role of Wonder Woman in an upcoming ﬁlm; another sought to move the
site of a large college football game; and another petition attempted to persuade Harry Potter
ﬁlmmakers to include a favorite character. Similar in spirit to these two categories, another
2.5 percent requested that products (in this case, exclusively video games) be “ported” to
different systems.47
Another 4 percent of petitions wanted changes that would ﬁx what consumers saw as
a defect in the original product. Games were prominent in this category, with petitions
complaining about the ability to cheat in Halo 2 or errors in Warcraft III that prevented
the game from running correctly. Slightly over 6 percent of petitions requested updates
to products. Sequels were a common request here, with petitions that asked for a third
Bill and Ted ﬁlm, a sequel to the video game Skies of Arcadia, or a sequel to the ﬁlm Last
As is evident from the examples and their frequencies, the vast majority of these petitions
attempted to compel producers to alter their practices or products. But is there any evidence
that these petitioners understood these activities as part of their role as consumers? Data
shown in Figures 4 and 5 provide some leverage over these questions, showing that the
answer seems to be yes.
Figure 4 is based on data that petition creators provided when they created a petition.
Speciﬁcally, in the petition startup form, creators are asked if there are particular “eligible
signatories” for their petition. Unfortunately, over half of petitions did not have a speciﬁc

set of eligible signatories according to the signup form, and are thus not included in Figure 4.
However, of data that were entered in the signup form, fans/supporters (46.2 percent) and
consumers (25.5 percent) were among the most frequent categories.
Figure 5 is based on coding of the petition text itself, which often indicated some audience
for the petition and/or characteristics of likely petition supporters. These data provide an
interesting counterpart to the optional ﬁeld in the signup form, conﬁrming that petitions
were overwhelming expected to be signed by “fans.” Where an identity could be determined, 77 percent of petitions were designed for fans,48 as in these examples: “We have
been loyal fans to ECW since the beginning”49 and “We, the loyal fans of the Dodgers
and respecters of tradition, are appalled at the treatment of long time announcer Ross
Porter.”50
Beyond this general category of fan was a more specialized one in which signers or
petition authors identiﬁed themselves as members of a very speciﬁc, named fan group:
“Kopites”51 are fans of Liverpool soccer; “Pottermaniacs”52 are particularly enthusiastic
Harry Potter fans. This category of fan was a small proportion of the total set of petitions
(2.9 percent), but they are noteworthy for the highly specialized, personalized nature of the
self-identiﬁcation.
Other popular potential signers were identiﬁed as viewers or watchers (7.5 percent; one
such petition identiﬁes its signers as “Space-oriented viewers worldwide”53 and another
identiﬁes signers as “Old Nickelodeon watchers”54). A number of petitions (7.1 percent)
identiﬁed signers as gamers. Others were designated as users (2.1 percent): “This petition is designed to express the heartly [sic] disappointment and frustration of users using ValveTMSteam
Platform for online gaming.”55 Smaller numbers (.83 percent) of petitions identiﬁed petition
Contesting Cultural Control
signers as listeners or readers, writing, for example, “We, the listeners of Hot 97 (WQHT)
and family/friends/fans of Aaliyah Haughton, were outraged when morning show host Star
made fun of the death of Aaliyah on August 27th 2001.”56
Together, these data on petitions and desired signers support our claim that these petitions
represent a reformulation of the consumer role. Far from passive consumers of prior decades,
these consumers expect—and demand—particular things from producers. As such, these
consumers are defying expectations that they are passive, instead challenging the authority
of cultural producers to decide which products to produce and how they should be produced.
These data also suggest a sense of something akin to collective identity, where consumers
understand themselves not as part of a body politic but a cultural public that shares common
interests, common desires, and common cause with other fans, or Xenites, or Pottermaniacs.
We further see this as ﬁtting well with Jenkins’s suggestion that consumers’ self-identiﬁcation
with fan communities “does not simply afﬁrm their brand afﬁliation, but also empowers
these groups to assert their own demands on the company.”57 To the extent that the petition
writers identify themselves as fans, or as having specialized product-related identities, they
are creating communities through which they can and expect to make claims about the
products they consume.
Active Communities
To the extent that our data show some nascent sense of collective identity, or at least some
shared perspective among consumers, does it also imply any collective organization behind
these petitions and/or in support of these petitions? We have two pieces of evidence with
which to address this question. First, the petition startup form asked petition authors to name
any speciﬁc group or community what would likely support the petition, such as “members
of the Sierra Club.”58
We categorized the communities named and found that 178 of 564 petitions (or about
32 percent) did name some informal or formal group, including seventy-six petitions (13.5
percent of all petitions) that indicated some named fan community, forty-one (7.3 percent
of all petitions) that indicated some organization or group that was not fan-based, thirty (5.3
percent of all petitions) that indicated the membership of some formal organization, and
thirty-one petitions (5.5 percent of all petitions) that indicated a looser version of community
where supporters shared common characteristics but did not come together in groups. While
not a majority of petitions, it is notable that nearly a third of the petitions we coded were
expected to be supported by a speciﬁc community.
Second, the petition startup form also asked petition creators to indicate whether expected
supporters and/or support communities had a Web presence. About two-thirds of the petitions that were expected to be supported by communities had a Web presence (112 petitions
out of 178). Another thirty-four petitions had a Web presence for supporters who were
not labeled as a community (and hence not coded as part of the 178 community-supported
petitions). These data suggest that the communities that underlie these petitions may be constituted or maintained online, potentially deepening the digital impact on civic engagement
(and on the deﬁnition of civic) examined in this chapter.
Discussion and Conclusion
The prominent role of cultural industries in the day-to-day lives of consumers seems undeniable. We have argued that contestation centered on the goods produced by those industries
Civic Life Online
is a meaningful form of civic engagement—perhaps even one that signals a signiﬁcant shift
in the relationship between consumers and producers. We have also argued that this engagement may be particularly important for youth. Petitioners are not passive consumers,
content with whatever producers offer. They are active users who both take meaning from
and assign it to cultural material. By asking for ﬁxes, sequels, and improvements, users are
making a different kind of claim to ownership, claims made even more pronounced when
consumers reshape and redistribute those goods.59
Our ﬁndings have implications beyond the institutionalization of movement tactics and
new relationships between consumers and products. One important implication concerns
legal issues and digital property, a concern that has been raised by numerous scholars.
DiMaggio et al., for example, identify some of the areas in which both political engagement
and culture are subject to change as digital technology proliferates.60 They highlight one
of the issues that has been most enduring in the study of intersecting politics and culture
online, suggesting that widespread “ideals of openness” online are likely to conﬂict with the
needs of commercial actors in the digital marketplace to protect their investments via copy
protection and copyright policies. Healy notes that policies about how cultural goods are
shared and distributed will affect the extent to which consumers of those products will be
passive or active users; that is, the protections that guarantee markets for cultural producers
are likely to impinge on the ability of consumers to modify or redistribute digital products.61
To the extent that policies favor producers, those producers might, as Balkin writes, “push
consumers back into their pre-Internet roles as relatively passive recipients of mass media
content.”62
Lessig recognizes that this openness is not guaranteed, noting that the tradition of a
“free culture” of fair use, or of reappropriating music, images, and text to make new creative or cultural works, is transformed into a “permissions culture” by restrictive policies
or copy protection technologies.63 It is clear that the mold of future digital products is
yet to be cast, and, while consumers seem to be asserting new kinds of relationships with
culture, the further development of law and policy will greatly affect the realization of
those relationships. We take the fact that petitioners are collectively pursuing changes to
cultural goods as an important opening for a potentially larger engagement between consumers (and youth as a critical subset of consumers), producers, and the state over these
There are reasons to believe that the kinds of engagements we discuss here could in fact
lead to more standard forms of political and civic engagement later. As Rheingold discusses
in his chapter in this volume, research on online engagement suggests that some kinds of
online interaction can lead to more explicitly political online engagement.64 Rheingold also
suggests two criteria for activities (or broader projects) that are more likely to turn Internet
use into online political engagement: (1) whether the activity involves connection to others
and (2) whether young people learn to express themselves. We think the cause-oriented
engagements we studied here provide that connection to a community of other interested
persons and that petition writing and signing can be a forum for learning how to express
oneself in a collective context. Furthermore, we think it is important to note that young
people are learning these things while they work on issues they care about—as opposed to
issues that adults believe they should care about—and using tools that they appropriated—as
opposed to tools that were assigned to them. The authenticity of these actions, then, might
also be independently important to the experience of young people involved in cultural
contestation.
Contesting Cultural Control
Beyond the potential to spur political activity over time, the implications of our study for
research are also signiﬁcant. For instance, scholars need to consider how it is that participants
come to take part in online petitions, or online protests more generally. Some well-known
models for recruiting participation seem to be a good ﬁt for explaining this kind of engagement: being asked to participate, for example, is a factor that seems important to ofﬂine
political and protest engagement65 and is also likely to ﬁt an online model of forwarded
e-mail, blog entries soliciting comment, and petitions that encourage signers to add their
e-mail address to the list. Other models of participation, however, such as those rooted in organizational membership66 may ﬁnd less support online. It also seems likely that additional
factors, unanticipated by prior models of participation, are at work; future research should
explore this in more detail.
Much of the research ahead is also speciﬁcally focused on youth. For instance, in addition to the importance of cultural products to youth culture, are there other reasons why
young people seem so interested in Internet petitioning on entertainment-related topics?
One likely possibility is that people are often more likely to participate in protest, or politics more generally, when they think that their efforts may “matter.” There are numerous
anecdotes, some relayed above, of even small online petitions (a few hundred signers or less)
resulting in changes to corporate policies or products. This ﬁts with existing expectations
on the part of scholars that a personal sense of efﬁcacy may be an important factor that
prompts people to engage in collective action. That sense of efﬁcacy may be something
young people are gaining from their cultural contestation that they do not get from interactions with government. For instance, research by Coleman suggests that in more formal
political arenas, cultural consumers—such as Big Brother enthusiasts—often feel as though
their opinions and actions won’t matter.67 If this efﬁcacy is a motivator for participation,
then online petitioning will translate into broader political engagement only where youth
feel like their voices will matter. Consequently, it remains to be seen whether an early sense
of efﬁcacy in cultural contestation will translate into explicitly state-oriented activity in the
Another question for future research involves whether the kind of petitioning we analyzed
here will continue. We suspect that it will and that we have actually only begun the chart
the long course of Internet petitions involved in cultural contestation. Even if young people
or adults begin to translate the concerns we discussed here into more explicitly political
concerns over intellectual property, as we discussed just above, we suspect that this will be
an extension, not a replacement, of ongoing petitioning. Of course, only time, and future
research, will determine whether our best guess is correct.
Methodological Appendix
This appendix covers technical details of the manual content coding completed by the
Data From PetitionOnline
Where data provided by PetitionOnline is concerned, the coding scheme was as follows:
COMMUNITY SUPPORT ﬁeld of the petition setup form. This ﬁeld indicated which
individuals or groups, if any, were likely to support the petition according to the petition author. Coding categories included fans (e.g., “fans of WWE” and “Xenites,” who
Civic Life Online
are fans of Xena), individuals who shared speciﬁed characteristics other than being fans
(e.g., “people who have taste”), groups or formal organizations (e.g., the Example Guild),
and members of a group or formal organization but not the actual group (e.g., members
of Example Guild).
“Web Presence of Support Group” was coded “1” if the individuals or groups coded in
Support Group had a Web site or other identiﬁable Internet presence and “0” if they did
“Continent” was coded based on the country (if any) that was listed by the petition
creator in the geographic ﬁelds in the petition setup form. Categories included North
America, South or Central America, Europe, Africa (which had an observed frequency
of 0), the Middle East, the former Soviet bloc or Russia, East Asia (including Japan but
excluding former Soviet block countries), and Australia.
“Governmental Target” was coded based on the target listed by the petition creator in
the petition setup form. Categories included governmental entities, quasi-governmental
entities, private entities, and “other.”
“Speciﬁc Target” was coded based on the target listed by the petition creator in the
petition setup form. Categories included individuals based on a shared characteristics
except for youth and/or students (e.g., fans, women); youth and/or students; celebrities
(including musical bands); religious organizations; individual managers or employees
of a company or other organization; a ﬁlm, video, or television company or industry
group; a music or talk radio company or industry group; a computer-related company or
industry group (including video game producers and Internet Web sites); a publishing
and print media company or industry group; a sports/athletics company or industry
group (including wrestling and NASCAR); a toy company or industry group; an explicitly multimedia company (e.g., Sony); an entertainment company or industry group
not elsewhere classiﬁed; a non–entertainment-related business not elsewhere classiﬁed;
a private club or organization; the executive branch and/or an executive ﬁgure; a government agency (e.g., attorney general, IRS, FDA); a legislative branch of the government
and/or a legislative ﬁgure; a judicial branch of the government and/or a judicial ﬁgure;
a foreign government or their embassy; a tribal government; law enforcement and/or
corrections; government bodies not elsewhere classiﬁed; and a category for “Other, not
elsewhere classiﬁed.”
“Total Signatures” was simply the count of signatures provided by PetitionOnline; it did
not require any coding by the authors.
Data Coded From the Text of Mirrored Petitions
Additional data were coded from the text of petitions themselves, as detailed below:
“English” was coded “1” when petitions were written in English (including those written
in English and a second language), and “0” otherwise. Non-English petitions were not
coded further.
“Second Language” is the name of the second, non-English language that appeared in
the petition, if any.
“Claims:” As many as four claims were coded for each petition. The claim is coded to represent the action sought by the petitioner. Claims codes included the support or revival
Contesting Cultural Control
of a product or celebrity; seeking to save a product from being discontinued or canceled;
calls for publicity for a product; expressions of support, concern, or care for a product
or celebrity; requests to ﬁx or repair a product that is asserted to be broken; requests to
update an existing product, such as through the creation of a new album or a sequel;
expansion of an existing product, such as by broadcasting to a wider area or distributing
in an additional format; changes to a product otherwise unspeciﬁed; requests to “port”
a product such as a game to another platform or hardware system; claims regarding
intellectual property such as patent or digital rights management issues; claims regarding copyright as a speciﬁc issue; issues regarding prices of products or services; claims
relating to customer service; claims pertaining to law or policy speciﬁcally; and a ﬁnal
category for other claims not represented by this list. In the case of claims not speciﬁed
in by the earlier categories, text was entered to more fully describe the petition’s claim.
“Product/Celebrity” is a categorical variable coded to represent the type of product
on which the petitions are seeking some action. It contains the following categories:
speciﬁc celebrity or group of celebrities (Eddie Guerrero or the Rat Pack); speciﬁc movie
or set of ﬁlms; speciﬁc television show or shows; speciﬁc singer, band, song, or music
source (such as a radio station); speciﬁc video or online game(s); speciﬁc nongame
software; and a category for other types of products.
“Product name” is a text ﬁeld containing the actual name of whatever product is the
focus of the petition.
“Industry” is coded to represent the umbrella industry that produces the focal product,
and is coded with the following categories: radio, television, ﬁlm and video, games,
music, software, athletics, and a ﬁnal category for industries not otherwise speciﬁed.
When this last category was indicated, an additional text ﬁeld was completed to describe
the industry.
“Date” was coded any time the petition indicated a speciﬁc end date, and included ﬁelds
for standard date elements (year, month, day) plus season (winter, spring, summer, fall).
“Signers” were coded up to four times for each petition to represent the types of people
identiﬁed as the petitioners. Signer categories include fans, users, gamers, watchers,
listeners, readers, students, men, women, and speciﬁc types of named fans such as
“Pottermaniacs.” A ﬁnal category was included to allow text for types of signers not
otherwise classiﬁed, such as “loyal followers,” “family members,” or “friends.”

6. Coleman, p. 12, is contributing to a broader debate about how to deﬁne politics, activism, and
community both online as well as ofﬂine. Online, boundaries between institutional and extra- or antiinstitutional activity are becoming less distinct and the costs of engaging in those activities are shrinking.
Ofﬂine, the tactics of social movements are increasingly appropriated for new ends in a movement
society. As both trends continue, scholars are increasingly confronting the question of how to deﬁne
challenges to power.

that activists engage in contestation over the public images of companies whose behavior they seek to
change. While the domain of culture and consumer goods is common between our work and Bennett’s,
we differ in that the activists Bennett identiﬁes are much more explicitly political in both their goals
and tactics.

cultural goods, rather than a genuine display of contention. However, our detailed reading of the
petitions does not support this alternative reading. Authors generally phrased their concerns as a set of
demands or desires, not as simply informative. As well, the choice of a petitioning Web site is highly
suggestive of an at least somewhat adversarial posture.

Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage
Civic Engagement
Howard Rheingold
Stanford University, Communication Department
As increasing numbers of young people seek to master the use of media tools to express
themselves, explore their identities, and connect with peers—to be active creators as well as
consumers of culture—educators have an opportunity to encourage young media makers to
exercise active citizenship.1 Might teachers enlist these young people’s enthusiasm for using
digital media in the service of civic engagement? I propose one way to do this: help students
communicate in their public voices about issues they care about.
The eager adoption of Web publishing, digital video production and online video distribution, social networking services, instant messaging, multiplayer role-playing games, online
communities, virtual worlds, and other Internet-based media by millions of young people
around the world demonstrates the strength of their desire—unprompted by adults—to learn
digital production and communication skills. According to a 2005 survey by the Pew Internet
and American Life Project, “The number of teenagers using the internet has grown 24% in
the past four years and 87% of those between the ages of 12 and 17 are online.”2 This interest
by American (and Brazilian, British, Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Persian, etc.) youth in media
production practices might well be a function of adolescents’ needs to explore their identities
and experiment with social interaction—and can be seen as a healthy active response to the
hypermediated environment they’ve grown up in.3
Whatever else might be said of teenage bloggers, dorm-room video producers, or the
millions who maintain pages on social network services like MySpace and Facebook, it cannot
be said that they are passive media consumers. They seek, adopt, appropriate, and invent
ways to participate in cultural production.4 Another recent Pew study found that more than
50 percent of today’s teenagers have created as well as consumed digital media.5 This chapter
focuses on those avid young digital media makers in the knowledge that addressing the needs
of those who are not able to participate in cultural production, the other half of the digital
divide, remains an important task. Although signiﬁcant barriers remain in regard to lessprivileged youth, this chapter addresses the educational needs and opportunities of the large
minority of young people around the world, of many nationalities and socioeconomic levels,
who are avid digital media creators.
Some recent data indicates that American youth are interested in civic engagement as well
as in playing with media. A research team commissioned by MTV interviewed more than
twelve hundred young people, conducted expert interviews and ethnographies, and took
a national poll of a representative sample ages 12–24, between December 2005 and April
2006.6 Although the research found, “With 70% believing in the importance of helping the
community, 68% already doing something to support a cause on a monthly basis and 82%
Civic Life Online
describing themselves at least ‘somewhat involved,’ it does seem that the majority of young
people are convinced that supporting a social cause is something they should do. However,
there is a strong disparity between interest and involvement, an ‘activation gap,’ and there
is signiﬁcant room for growth.”
Michael Xenos and Kirsten Foot, in their chapter for this volume, warn, in regard to youth
involvement with traditional election campaigns: “Based on the best available indicators and
techniques for understanding both what young people are looking for in an electoral politics
experience on the Web, and what campaign organizations are providing, a substantial gulf
is evident between them. If this gap is left unaddressed, we believe future developments in
online campaigning will fail to attract all but the most politically oriented young voters into
greater involvement with the electoral system. In the long run, this means that the potential
of new media to help reverse signiﬁcant declines in youth political involvement may go
unrealized.” Other authors in this volume—Bennett, Bers, Coleman, Earl and Schussman,
Montgomery, Raynes-Goldie and Walker—echo this opinion in different ways.
Jennifer Earl and Alan Schussman in particular note, “If young people are growing up in
movement societies, where scripts and practices from social movements have become part
of everyday thinking, and producing online protest actions (which embodies these pervasive
social movement schemas) has become extremely inexpensive, particularly to those who
have moderate computing skills, then we should expect that young people will begin to
use online protest-organizing tools to mount protests about issues they care about.” Indeed,
Kathryn Montgomery notes in her chapter in this volume that young people have used
online social networks to engage one of the most contentious techno-political issues today,
with more than seventeen thousand of them signing up as “friends of network neutrality”
on MySpace.
The MTV-sponsored study group suggested, among other measures, that educators “integrate pro-social goals into activities that young people already enjoy doing.” Yet another
pair of US researchers, Skelton and Valentine , looked at youth political activism and
argued that “when young people’s action is looked for, rather than focusing on what they
are not doing, it becomes clear that even groups of young people traditionally assumed
not to be active social agents are in fact demonstrating forms of political participation and
action”7 Earl and Schussman in this volume assert, “One must ask whether existing notions
of what comprises civic engagement tend to ignore, devalue, and otherwise marginalize ways
in which younger citizens are connecting with one another to collectively make a difference
in their own worlds.”
A U.K. research group that surveyed over a thousand young people, age eighteen and up,
was less sanguine about the value of online media practices, concluding that “the broad
decline in youth participation might be better redressed through ofﬂine initiatives, strengthening the opportunities structures of young people’s lives and the ‘communities of practice’
available to them, rather than building Web sites which, though they will engage a few,
will struggle to reach the majority or, more important, to connect that majority to those
with power over their lives in a manner that young people themselves judge effective and
consequential.” Livingstone, Couldry, and Markham, the authors of the U.K. study, added,
“Rather than blaming young people for their apathy, the ﬁnger might instead be pointed
at the online and ofﬂine structures of opportunity that facilitate, shape and develop young
people’s participation. Focus groups with young people suggest a generation bored with politics, critical of the online offer, instead interested in celebrity and conforming to peer norms.
Young people protest that ‘having your say’ does not seem to mean ‘being listened to,’ and
so they feel justiﬁed in recognising little responsibility to participate.”8
Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage Civic Engagement
These trends suggest the importance of social scaffolding for any interventions involving
self-expression—other peers in the class and the teacher must act as the ﬁrst “public” that
reads/views/listens and responds. For example, Peter Levine’s chapter in this volume focuses
on the problem of “ﬁnding appropriate audiences for students’ work.” Preliminary effort
to recruit respondents willing to provide feedback from interest groups, peer communities,
community organizations, the press, and especially political leaders and civil servants are
essential to proper preparation. It isn’t “voice” if nobody seems to be listening. Finding the
ﬁrst publics who can respond to bloggers is as important as introducing people to blogs as
vehicles of potential public inﬂuence. In the blogosphere, speaking your mind is necessary
to be hearable, but doesn’t guarantee that you will be heard.
Participatory Media in the Curriculum—and in Society
What if teachers could help students discover what they really care about, then show them
how to use digital media to learn more and to persuade others? Constructivist theories of
education that exhort teachers to guide active learning through hands-on experimentation
are not new ideas, and neither is the notion that digital media can be used to encourage this
kind of learning.9 Marina Bers in this volume offers a constructivist approach to using virtual
worlds as an avenue to civic engagement for young people. What is new is a population of
“digital natives” who have learned how to learn new kinds of software before they started
high school, who carry mobile phones, media players, game devices, and laptop computers
and know how to use them, and for whom the Internet is not a transformative new technology but a feature of their lives that has always been there, like water and electricity.10
This population is both self-guided and in need of guidance: although a willingness to learn
new media by point-and-click exploration might come naturally to today’s student cohort,
there’s nothing innate about knowing how to apply their skills to the processes of democracy.
Internet media are not offered here as the solution to young people’s disengagement from
political life, but as a possibly powerful tool to be deployed toward helping them engage.
It is not easy for many teachers to adopt this perspective and put it into action in the
classroom—the political and economic necessity of teaching to the test leaves little room to
ﬁt these kinds of skills lessons into mandated and standardized curriculum. “Accountability”
and innovation are often locked into a zero-sum game. Lack of resources, training, and
technical support offer signiﬁcant additional obstacles.
In Confronting The Challenges of Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21st Century,
Jenkins et al. see an entirely new kind of culture emerging from the use of participatory media,
characterizing the shift as one that should not be reduced to the enabling technology, but
“rather represents a shift in the way our culture operates.”:
This context places new emphasis on the need for schools and afterschool programs to devote attention
to fostering what we are calling the new media literacies – a set of cultural competencies and social skills
which young people need as they confront the new media landscape. Participatory culture shifts the
focus of literacy training from individual expression onto community involvement: the new literacies
are almost all social skills which have to do with collaboration and networking. These skills build on
the foundation of traditional literacy, research skills, technical skills, and critical analysis skills which
should have been part of the school curriculum all along.11
If print culture shaped the environment in which the Enlightenment blossomed and set the
scene for the Industrial Revolution, participatory media might similarly shape the cognitive
and social environments in which twenty-ﬁrst-century life will take place (a shift in the way
Civic Life Online
our culture operates). For this reason, participatory media literacy is not another subject to
be shoehorned into the curriculum as job training for knowledge workers. Jenkins et al. put
it this way:
Much of the resistance to embracing media literacy training comes from the sense that the school day is
bursting at its seams, that we cannot cram in any new tasks without the instructional system breaking
down altogether. For that reason, we do not want to see media literacy treated as an add-on subject.
Rather, we should see it as a paradigm shift, one which, like multiculturalism or globalization, reshapes
how we teach every existing subject. Media change is impacting every aspect of our contemporary
experience and as a consequence, every school discipline needs to take responsibility for helping students
to master the skills and knowledge they need to function in a hypermediated environment.12
Arguing for the place of participatory media literacy in the curriculum is not a peripheral
debate, but is part of one of the deﬁning conﬂicts of our time, a power struggle that involves
political, economic, technological, as well as educational dimensions. Participatory media
literacy is an active response to the as-yet-unsettled battles over political and economic power
in the emerging mediasphere, and to the possibility that today’s young people could have a
say in shaping part of the world they will live in—or might be locked out of that possibility.
The struggle for participatory media literacy in schools must be seen in the context of these
broader societal conﬂicts.
Participatory media include (but aren’t limited to) blogs, wikis, RSS, tagging and social
bookmarking, music-photo-video sharing, mashups, podcasts, digital storytelling, virtual
communities, social network services, virtual environments, and videoblogs. These distinctly
different media share three common, interrelated characteristics:
Many-to-many media now make it possible for every person connected to the network
to broadcast as well as receive text, images, audio, video, software, data, discussions,
transactions, computations, tags, or links to and from every other person. The asymmetry between broadcaster and audience that was dictated by the structure of predigital
technologies has changed radically. This is a technical–structural characteristic.
Participatory media are social media whose value and power derives from the active
participation of many people. Value derives not just from the size of the audience, but
from their power to link to each other, to form a public as well as a market. This is a
psychological and social characteristic.
Social networks, when ampliﬁed by information and communication networks, enable
broader, faster, and lower cost coordination of activities.13 This is an economic and
political characteristic.
Like the early days of print, radio, and television, the present structure of the participatory
media regime—the political, economic, social and cultural institutions that constrain and
empower the way the new medium can be used, and which impose structures on ﬂows
of information and capital—is still unsettled. As legislative and regulatory battles, business
competition, and social institutions vie to control the new regime, a potentially decisive
and presently unknown variable is the degree and kind of public participation. Because the
unique power of the new media regime is precisely its participatory potential, the number of
people who participate in using it during its formative years, and the skill with which they
attempt to take advantage of this potential, is particularly salient. The outcome of contemporary regulatory battles that are obscure to the majority of citizens will likely determine
whether future participatory media will be enclosed economically, controlled centrally, and
Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage Civic Engagement
co-opted politically, or whether participatory media will enable broad cultural production
and authentically democratic political inﬂuence. Kathryn Montgomery’s chapter in this volume offers a detailed description of the battle over “network neutrality.”
If literacy is an ability to encode as well as decode, with contextual knowledge of how
communication can attain desired ends—then “voice,” the part of the process where a
young person’s individuality comes into play, might help link self-expression with civic
participation.
Public Voice: The Bridge between Media Production and Civic Engagement
Making connections between the literacies students pick up simply by being young in the
twenty-ﬁrst century and those best learned through reading and discussing texts is an appropriate role for teachers today. My fundamental assumption for beginning to teach participatory media skills myself, based on my own encounters with students in social cyberspaces
and the advice of more experienced educators, is that “voice,” the unique style of personal
expression that distinguishes one’s communications from those of others, can be called upon
to help connect young people’s energetic involvement in identity-formation with their potential engagement with society as citizens. Moving from a private to a public voice can
help students turn their self-expression into a form of public participation.14 Public voice is
learnable, a matter of consciously engaging with an active public rather than broadcasting
to a passive audience.
The public voice of individuals, aggregated and in dialogue with the voices of other individuals, is the fundamental particle of “public opinion.” When public opinion has the power
and freedom to inﬂuence policy and grows from the open, rational, critical debate among
peers posited by Jurgen Habermas and others, it can be an essential instrument of democratic
self-governance.15 James Fishkin at Stanford, John Gastil at the University of Washington,
Peter Levine at the University of Maryland (see Levine’s chapter in this volume) and others
have been investigating whether better deliberative practice can produce better publics.16
Deliberation, however, is only part of public discourse. Investigation, advocacy, criticism,
debate, persuasion, and politicking are all part of the process.
The political philosopher J¨urgen Habermas deﬁned the public sphere decades before the
Internet became a vehicle for political expression:
By “public sphere,” we mean ﬁrst of all a domain of our social life in which such a thing as public opinion
can be formed. Access to the public sphere is open in principle to all citizens. A portion of the public
sphere is constituted in every conversation in which private persons come together to form a public. They
are then acting neither as business or professional people conducting their private affairs, nor as legal
consociates subject to the legal regulations of a state bureaucracy and obligated to obedience. Citizens
act as a public when they deal with matters of general interest without being subject to coercion; thus
with the guarantee that they may assemble and unite freely, and express and publicize their opinions
Habermas drew attention to the intimate connection between a web of free, informal personal communications and the foundations of democratic society. Because the public sphere
depends on free communication and discussion of ideas, it changes when it scales—as soon
as your political entity grows larger than the number of citizens you can ﬁt into a modest
town hall, this vital marketplace for political ideas can be inﬂuenced by changes in communications technology. Communication media, and the ways the state permits citizens to
use them, are essential to the public sphere in a large society. Ask anybody living under an
Civic Life Online
authoritarian government about the right to talk freely among friends and neighbors, to call
a meeting to protest government policy, or to raise certain issues on a blog or in a BBS. Brute
totalitarian seizure of communications technology or automation of censorship are not the
only ways that political powers can neutralize the ability of citizens to talk freely. Habermas
also feared that the public sphere in the mass media era has already been corrupted by paid
fake discourse—from the public relations industry to campaign media strategies.18
Although civic engagement encompasses many dimensions, this chapter focuses on participation in the public sphere through direct experience with online publishing, discourse,
debate, cocreation of culture, and collective action. By showing students how to use Webbased tools and channels to inform publics, advocate positions, contest claims, and organize
action around issues that they truly care about, participatory media education can draw
them into positive early experiences with citizenship that could inﬂuence their civic behavior throughout their lives. Formal theories of the public sphere could be introduced most
productively after, and in the context of, direct experience of exercising a public voice.19
Talking about public opinion making is a richer experience if you’ve tried to do it.
In one sense, public voice can be characterized not just as active, but as generative—a
public is brought into being in a sense by the act of addressing some text in some medium to
it. Michael Warner has argued that any particular public (as distinguished from “the public”)
comes into being only when it is addressed by a media text, rather than existing a priori
—“it exists by virtue of being addressed.”20 By writing a blog post about an issue, a blogger
brings together people whose only common interest is the issue addressed, bringing about
“a relation among strangers” that would probably not otherwise exist. Creating a wiki about
a local issue has the potential to precipitate a public that can inform itself, stage debates,
even organize collective action.
I recognize that precipitating publics and organizing collective action are volatile practices that are often interpreted (and prohibited and punished) as “rebellious” by parents and
schools. Stephen Coleman notes in his chapter in this volume that “[t]he policy of ‘targetting’ young people so that they can ‘play their part’ can be read either as a spur to youth
activism or an attempt to manage it. Indeed, the very notion of youth e-citizenship seems
to be caught between divergent strategies of management and autonomy.. . . The conﬂict
between the two faces of e-citizenship is between a view of democracy as an established
and reasonably just system, with which young people should be encouraged to engage, and
democracy as a political as well as cultural aspiration, most likely to be realised through networks in which young people engage with one another.” This tension between parental and
teacher authority on one hand and the contentious, even rebellious, processes that are as fundamental to democracy as they are vexing to authority ﬁgures is an obvious site of potential
In particular, Coleman contrasts the adult view of training young people to be part of
the existing political system—“good citizens”—and the view that democracy lives precisely
within the unruly peer-to-peer relationships, networks, and norms that young people seek
to develop for themselves. danah boyd, whose chapter, “Why Youth (Heart) Social Network
Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life” appears in the Identity volume of
the MacArthur Series on Digital Media and Learning, asserts the same case that Coleman argues.
The value of the peer-to-peer network is not only essential, boyd argues, but necessarily prior
to more orthodox forms of democratic discourse:21 “In order to engage in political life, people
have to have access to public life ﬁrst. Youth need publics—networked or physical—before
they can engage in any form of political life. Politics start ﬁrst with the school, with your
Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage Civic Engagement
friends . . . then they grow to being about civics. Pushing the other way won’t work. You
need to start with the dramas that make sense to you.”22
I propose that learning to use blogs, wikis, digital storytelling, podcasts, and video as media
of self-expression within a context of “public voice” should be introduced and evaluated
in school curricula, after-school programs, and informal learning communities if today’s
youth are to become effective citizens in the emerging era of networked publics.23 In the
twenty-ﬁrst century, participatory media education and civic education are inextricable. For
those educators who believe this assertion is worth testing in practice, this chapter and its
references, including a public Web site for sharing experiences and knowledge, is offered by
the author as a public resource.24
From the Blogosphere to the Public Sphere
A blog is a Web page that is updated frequently, with the most recent entry displayed at the
top of the page. Given the simplicity of this deﬁnition of blog, a wild variety of diaries, news
sources, reference repositories, collaboratories, ﬁlters, compendia, lab journals, classroom
discussions, critical essays, rants, polemics, jokes, guides, advertising pitches, and social and
political movements has resulted, with over seventy million blogs tracked worldwide by
Technorati by 2006.25 The term blogosphere to describe the interlinked web of blogs was
invented as a joke in September 1999, according to Wikipedia.26
The political power of the blogosphere grew visible to the mainstream in 2003. Volunteer
investigator-bloggers kept alive the story of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott’s racist public
remarks and unearthed similar incidents in the past, eventually costing him his leadership
position.27 In September 2004, CBS newscaster Dan Rather claimed to have documents that
showed presidential candidate George W. Bush to have whitewashed his absences from
National Guard duty. Again, amateur fact-checkers organized online and turned up evidence
that the documents cited by Rather were forgeries.28
Millions of people appear to be expressing their opinions online. Does that add up to a
signiﬁcant revitalization of the public sphere? The answer to that question is still contested.
In the days of the pre-Web Internet, Fernback and Thompson argued against such a notion,
warning of the danger that people would sit in front of their computers and mistake typing
at each other for political action: “Indeed, it seems most likely that the virtual public sphere
brought about by CMC will serve a cathartic role, allowing the public to feel involved rather
than to advance actual participation.”29 A decade later, Yochai Benkler, in his 2006 book,
The Wealth of Networks, commented:
We are witnessing a fundamental change in how individuals can interact with their democracy and
experience their role as citizens. Ideal citizens need not be seen purely as trying to inform themselves
about what others have found, so that they can vote intelligently. They need not be limited to reading
the opinions of opinion makers and judging them in private conversations. They are no longer constrained to occupy the role of mere readers, viewers, and listeners. They can be, instead, participants in
a conversation.30
Participants, like literate citizens, aren’t automatically produced by computer ownership:
access to the Internet and the capability of publishing a blog by a population is not sufﬁcient
to guarantee that blogging will have a signiﬁcant positive impact on the political public
sphere. The way in which that population uses the medium will matter. The literacies that
this curriculum seeks to impart could be a crucially inﬂuential battle in this struggle over the
political impact of blogging. Knowing how to take a tool into one’s hand is no guarantee
Civic Life Online
that anyone will do anything productive, but without such knowledge, productive use is less
likely—and hegemonic control becomes more likely by those who do know exactly how to
exercise the power of the new media.
It is not yet clear whether the blogosphere or any aggregation of online arguments constitute the ideal of constructive debate that public sphere theorists posit, but if Benkler’s assessment is correct—that many-to-many media afford a window of opportunity for populations
to exercise democratic power over would-be rulers—it seems possible that education could
play a pivotal role by equipping today’s digital natives with historical knowledge, personal
experience, rhetorical skills, and a theoretical framework for understanding the connection
between their power to publish online, their power to inﬂuence the circumstances of their
own lives, and the health of democracy.
A Few Examples of Participative Media and Civic Engagement
An exhaustive or even fully representative cross-section of case histories is not possible within
the scope of this chapter, but real examples of participative pedagogy should not be ignored
either. Pointers to many more examples are available on the chapter’s companion wiki.
Listening to what young people care about is the necessary ﬁrst step in enlisting their
enthusiasm. Youth-initiated applications of media to public issues is the ﬁrst place I would
begin my knowledge gathering. What are young people cooking up on their own accord?
How are they appropriating media for public advocacy or contestation?
One illustrative example: While he was a Toronto high school student, Wojciech Gryc
started a blog that attracted the attention of other high school students; together, they
created an online webzine31 that turned into an organization dedicated to youth, media,
and civic engagement, “Five Minutes to Midnight.”32 In correspondence with the author,
Gryc wrote that his organization “gets youth involved in human rights through media and
journalism. We are based in Toronto, Canada, but use the Web to promote our work. We
publish a Web magazine, run workshops on Web development, and have even travelled to
Chad and Brazil to promote youth involvement through the use of open source software,
development of media, and similar projects. The entire organization is run by youth 20 years
of age or under (this includes the entire Board of Directors).”33 Gryc and another young
volunteer, ´Emanu`ele Lapierre-Fortin, spent more than three weeks running workshops on
open-source software in Chad for Raﬁgui.34 “During that time, we made a video commercial
for a picnic, taught the group how to work on their newspaper using GIMP, OpenOfﬁce,
InkScape, and got donations of laptops and a digital camera.”35
The youth of the “Fantasy Congress Founding Fathers” is clear from the photograph of
their Web site, and is reﬂected in their self-description:
The mission of Fantasy CongressTM is to involve individuals in the legislative process and the daily
goings-on of Congress by means of computer simulation. Fantasy CongressTM is easy to use, making it
simple for anyone to monitor the performance of his or her team, track the contributions of individual
senators and representatives to the team, and follow latest news on their team members. Discussion
boards make gameplay even more dynamic by enabling players to interact more directly with each other.
By inspiring people to care about government as much as they care about sports, Fantasy Congress hopes
to encourage government transparency and responsibility while educating the governed.
Fantasy CongressTM is more than just a totally sweet game. Drawing from the broadest and most
up-to-date database of its kind, it ranks sitting members of Congress by legislative efﬁcacy and other
criteria.36
Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage Civic Engagement
Fantasy CongressTM founders were four students at Claremont McKenna College. Founder Andrew
Lee came up with the idea for the game when he asked whether the enthusiasm his classmates put into
fantasy sports could be cast as a game that models the legislative process. He then enlisted three other
What have trained adult observers been able to report about youth media production
practices and civic engagement? Direct observations of young people’s actual media making
and consuming practices is where anthropologist Mizuko Ito has been directing her attention. Ito is codirecting a study, funded by the MacArthur Foundation, titled “Kids’ Informal
Learning With Digital Media: An Ethnographic Collaboration,” a joint effort between researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information and the University
of Southern California Annenberg Center for Communication. “The goal of this three-year
study is to observe how young people between the ages of 10 and 20 use digital technologies outside the classroom and then determine if these ‘native’ practices can be adapted for
use in the classroom as a means to make the educational experience more engaging and
effective.”37 Led by Peter Lyman, Mimi Ito, and Michael Carter, the Digital Youth project involves multi-institutional, interdisciplinary teams studying different aspects of youth media
practices.38
Henry Jenkins at MIT also combines theory, empirical study, and pedagogical practice
in “preparing students for jobs that don’t yet exist.”39 Another project supported by the
MacArthur Foundation’s Digital Media and Learning program, the New Media Literacies
project at MIT is “developing a theoretical framework and hands-on curriculum for K-12
students that integrates new media tools into broader educational, expressive and cultural
frameworks. The NML team, led by Dr. Jenkins and based at MIT’s Comparative Media
Studies program, is currently exploring K-12 digital literacy, guided by two questions: What
do young people need to know in order to become full, active, creative, critical, and ethically
responsible participants in a media-rich environment?, and what steps do we need to take
to make sure that these skills are available to all?”40
After ﬁrst looking at what young people as individuals and small groups are inventing,
I’d ask, “What are the most forward-looking communities of learners doing? Where are the
pioneering students, teachers, and schools who have joined participatory media and civic
engagement, and what are they doing?” An illustrative example, started in 1988, iEARN is
“the world’s largest non-proﬁt global network that enables teachers and young people to
use the Internet and other new technologies to collaborate on projects that both enhance
learning and make a difference in the world. . . . All projects in iEARN are initiated and
designed by teachers and students, and provide powerful examples of how new and emerging
technologies can make a difference in teaching and learning.”41 Many of the iEARN projects
link classrooms via online dialogue about civic issues, often involving Web publishing, digital
photography and video production. The Global Learning Project, for example, deployed
online dialogue and digital media while teaching about civil rights.42
Kathryn Montgomery cites in her chapter in this volume a number of examples, including
The Community Information Corps, of St. Paul, Minnesota, which “enlists teens to do public
art”; Tolerance.org, a project of the Southern Poverty Law Center that provides young people
with an activist approach to ﬁghting racism; Free the Planet! which “provides resources for
activists, and help students win campaigns for environmental protection”; Out Proud for
gay, lesbian, bisexual, transsexual youth; and WireTap, “Youth in pursuit of the dirty truth,”
a youth journalism effort by the progressive online magazine, Alternet. Montgomery also
cites the extensive use of Internet media by MTV’s “Rock the Vote” campaign. Also in this
Civic Life Online
volume, Kate Raynes-Goldie and Luke Walker detail their experiences with TakingITGlobal,
a global community of young activists, to register young voters.
Another collaboration of teachers and students uses video to give Harlem youth a worldwide forum to highlight issues that matter to them. HarlemLIVE blog, “Harlem’s Youth
Internet Publication” directly addresses civic issues of interest to Harlem youth and Harlem-
LIVE video produces and publishes teen-created videos about civic and cultural issues.43
HarlemLIVE “began in early 1996, at the beginning of the internet revolution, with just ﬁve
students, one laptop, a digital camera, and an advisor.”44
Note how student podcasters in a school in the U.K. don’t make a strong distinction
between “argue about issues that matter to us” and “share the music we write”: “Podminions
is the podcast of King’s Norton Boys’ School in Birmingham, U.K. Here we will tell stories
of the local community, the things we do in and out of school, argue about the issues that
matter to us and share with you the music we write.”45
Yet another important avenue of inquiry is opened by asking what universities are doing
to study, invent, or practice participatory media applications to civic engagement.
David Brake, doctoral student at the London School of Economics, is engaged, with professor Nick Couldry, in interviewing youth in the U.K. aged sixteen to nineteen “who have
produced weblogs that are principally narratives about themselves, examining the inﬂuences
and constraints on such storytelling. The research will focus primarily on the inﬂuence on
their practice of these young people’s relationship with their audiences (real and imagined),
but will also consider the technological characteristics of the weblogging service that they
use, the limits of their own digital and ‘traditional’ literacies and their understanding of
emergent expectations of the genre of personal weblogging.”46
In Australia, the Youth Internet Radio Network was established at Queensland University
of Technology to engage young people in creative forms of cultural production through
online networks. Using a combination of ethnography and action research, the researchers
will then observe and analyze how young people participate in these networks, and how
they are affected by this kind of interaction and participation. Youth Internet Radio Network
has launched a Web site that functions as both a social network and a platform for the creation and distribution of creative content. Queensland researchers Notley and Tacchi wrote:
“Mitra and Watts cite a central theme for communication scholars in the twenty-ﬁrst
century as the ‘resuscitation of voice.’ In redeﬁning the Internet, they envision ‘a discursive
space produced by the creative work of people whose spatial locations are ambiguous and
provisional.’ They consider that new constructs of ‘voice, agency, discourse and space’ in
‘cyberspace’ may have ‘liberating and empowering characteristics’ (ibid: 486).”47
In addition to the MacArthur Foundation’s Digital Media and Learning program, other
foundation-supported efforts include a spinoff from Save The Children Foundation, Youth
Noise, a webzine, social network, and online forum for young people concerned with creating
social change.48 The Web site, which claims 113,000 registered users from more than 170
countries, provides an interactive space through which young activists can connect to one
another and express their views. See the chapter by Kate Raynes-Goldie and Luke Walker
in this volume for more detailed discussion of Youth Noise. News 21 involves journalism
students among ﬁve participating research universities under the Carnegie–Knight Initiative
on the Future of Journalism Education.49 News 21 student journalists from Berkeley produced
broadcast-quality digital video from Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia, Djibouti in East Africa, South
Korea, the Persian Gulf, and the South China Sea to “bring home the world of the American
soldier serving abroad.”50
Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage Civic Engagement
These examples are meant to be illustrative, not exhaustive—to suggest how a broad
range of motivations and institutions has begun to awaken to the civic potential in the
media that both fascinate, manipulate, and potentially empower digital natives. The remainder of this chapter describes exercises for linking speciﬁc media with civic practices.
A detailed, open-ended repository of resources, syllabi, and best practices is maintained at

invitation and jump start for an ongoing community.
Blogging with a Public Voice
The following suggestions about ways participatory pedagogy might work in a classroom
assume broadband access to the Internet by students who are comfortable using the Web
and other digital tools, and have some time and permission to explore on their own. It
is important to assess the knowledge and tech base of the students before starting; some
basic instruction may be needed to bring all students up to the same skill level before
embarking on the exercises suggested here. Providing instruction is far less effective without
access. Individuals and small groups need time and freedom to experiment and explore alone
and together, in addition to the exercises performed during class time. Students should be
encouraged to teach one another whenever possible. A short portion of class time and online
time could be devoted to peer-to-peer lore sharing.
The following section is phrased in the voice of a teacher directly instructing students
on how to undertake exercise of a public voice through blogging. Although I go into some
detail about blogging, by way of concrete illustration of the theory I’ve presented, the suggested exercises for other media will be presented here in abbreviated form; more detailed
descriptions of these exercises are on the Participatory Media Literacy wiki51:
Assuming that you have set up a blog and know how to create html links and basic
formatting and publish a post, the next objective is to go beyond the mechanics of
blogging to work with blogging rhetoric—and to connect that rhetoric with your role as
a citizen in a democracy.
First, you will make a post that serves a community of interest by directing attention to a
worthwhile resource on the Web via an annotated link, including short, salient quotes,
and explaining why your selected resource is worthy of attention from this community.
Attracting a community of interest is not often an easy task.
Then you will construct a blog post that links to two or more Web sites and explain the
overarching idea that connects the sites you select—connective writing.
Then you engage in online critical public discourse by analyzing the content of a site
you link in a blog post, asking probing questions about the assumptions, assertions, and
logic of the arguments in the site you link.
Moving on to the exercise of a public voice, you will construct a post that takes a position
on an issue, using links to other relevant Web sites to support your position.
Blogger as Intelligent Filter: The Annotated Link Post
Many bloggers serve as “intelligent ﬁlters” for their publics by selecting, contextualizing,
and presenting links of particular interest for that public. In this context, a “public” differs
from an “audience” because you, in your role as a blogger, have in mind when you write a
Civic Life Online
community of peers who not only read but actively respond to what you write, who might act
upon your advice, and who might join you in discussion and collective action. The public you
choose to address could be a public in the sense of a political public sphere that undergirds
democracy—the communications you engage in with your fellow citizens, with whom you
share responsibility for self-governance. The public doesn’t have to be political, however. It
could be an engaged community of interest—others who share your profession, avocation, or
obsession. When fans begin writing fan ﬁction or remixing and sharing cultural content, they
are acting as a public—a culture-producing public. When bloggers researched discrepancies
in Dan Rather’s story about George W. Bush’s National Guard service, they were acting as a
public. AIDS patients organized collective action that inﬂuenced research funding and the
pharmaceutical industry—creating an effective public through their discussions about their
mutual interest.
What interests you, the blogger? What issue or idea strongly, even passionately, draws your
attention and provokes your opinion? Is there a community that shares your interest? Could
you and the others constitute a public? Clearly deﬁning and understanding your public is
the necessary ﬁrst step to developing a public voice—the voice you use when you keep that
public, and your potential to act together, clearly in mind as you blog.
Your ﬁrst exercise:
Deﬁne to your satisfaction and in your own terms a particular public. Use the resources
available to you and your research skills to inform yourself about the focus of that public’s
interest (see the Participatory Media Literacy wiki to use blogs and RSS to research the
subject). Compose a post addressed to that public, establishing the subject of shared
interest you plan to blog about.
Keeping that public in mind, post a link in a blog post to any site on the Web—a blog
post, a mainstream news item, a Wikipedia entry, an online community or marketplace,
audio or video content—that has the potential to enhance that public’s knowledge,
incite that public to take action, and provoke that public to respond to you.
Blogging as Connected Writing
Will Richardson began using the term connected writing to refer to a speciﬁc kind of critical,
disciplined blogging that he described in this way:
What I have been trying to celebrate, however, is what I see as an opportunity for a new type of writing
that blogs allow, one that forces those who do it to read carefully and critically, one that demands clarity
and cogency in its construction, one that is done for wide audience, and one that links to the sources
of the ideas expressed. . . . I’m talking about something uniquely suited to blogs. I’m talking about this
post, about our ability to connect ideas in ways that we could not do with paper, to distribute them in
ways we could not do with the restrictiveness of html, and to engage in conversations and community
in ways we could not do with newsgroups or other online communities before.52
Your second exercise:
Present to your public at least two links in the context of a post that makes clear their
value to your public and explains the connection between the links.
Use search engines and blog indexes like Technorati to ﬁnd other blogs that represent or
address your public or segments of your public, submit your posts to other bloggers. See
if you can get your friends to respond. “Priming the pump” of public response sometimes
requires marketing and personal persuasion.
Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage Civic Engagement
Elaborate a larger point, using the connection between the links you select to suggest a
wider pattern. Explain the connection and suggest a meaning. You don’t have to prove
your point in this exercise—just use two links and the connection between them as the
context for your own point, which should stand on its own. You can start with your
opinion and use the links as support or illustration; or you can start with the links and
approach your point inductively, by example.
Contributing to Critical Public Discourse: The Analytic Post
Loss of certainty about authority and credibility is one of the prices we pay for the
freedom of democratized publishing. We can no longer trust the author to guarantee
the veracity of work; today’s media navigators must develop critical skills in order to
ﬁnd their way through the oceans of information, misinformation, and disinformation
now available. The ability to analyze, investigate, and argue about what we read, see,
and hear is an essential survival skill. Some bloggers can and do spread the most outrageously inaccurate and fallaciously argued information; it is up to the readers and,
most signiﬁcantly, other bloggers to actively question the questionable. Democratizing
publishing creates a quality problem, the answer to which is—democratizing criticism.
Critical thinking is not something that philosophers do, but a necessary skill in a mediasphere where anybody can publish and the veracity of what you read can never be
Your third exercise:
Link to a Web site—a blog post, online story from a mainstream media organization, any
kind of Web site—and criticize it. If you can provide evidence that the facts presented
in the criticized Web site are wrong, then do so, but your criticism doesn’t have to
be about factual inaccuracy. Debate the logic or possible bias of the author. Make a
counterargument. Point out what the author leaves out. Voice your own opinion in
Exercising Your Public Voice: Making a Case for a Position
When you speak in a public voice—as a citizen appealing to other citizens as part of the
serious business of self-governance—you are undertaking the cocreation of democracy. Your
liberty probably depends on how well and how many citizens learn to use many-to-many
media to exercise their public voice.
Your fourth exercise:
Pick a position about a public issue, any public issue, that you are passionate about:
immigration; digital restrictions on music; steroid use by athletes; why the older generation misunderstands the younger generation’s taste in music. Any issue you care about
strongly enough to argue for or against.
Inform yourself. Search for information, and check the sources of authority of that
information—what do others say about the author of the information, what sources
does the author cite? Who has the freshest, most credible information about the issue
you care about, and what are they saying? Track several sources through Web searches
and blog feeds (see the Participatory Media Literacy wiki for instructions on RSS, blog
feeds, and search feeds). Use your ability to gather and track information online as a
means of knowing what you are talking about before you start saying anything in a
public voice.
Civic Life Online
Make a case for something—a position, an action, a policy—related to this public issue.
You don’t have to prove your case, but you have to state it. You don’t have to always
present an original position, but you always need to go beyond simply quoting the
positions of others. Again, you need to provide your public with the context you can
see, but which is absent from the quote or link alone. Provide an answer to your public’s
question: “What does the author of this blog post want me to know, believe, think, or
do? What point is the author making with this link?”
Use links to back up or add persuasiveness to your case. Use links to build your argument.
Use factual sources, statements by others that corroborate your assertions, and instances
that illustrate the point you want to make.
Contributing to Public Discourse: Commenting
Your ﬁfth exercise:
Add a constructive comment to the blog posts of three other students in your class.
Build on a point they make, offer evidence in support or in opposition to a position they take or claim they make, post a link to a resource that can illuminate
or extend the post. If the blogger whose post you comment then posts a reply to
your comment, see if you can extend the dialogue, invite others to participate and
contribute.
Try to solicit comments in a post on your blog. Ask for opinion, examples, evidence.
End your post in a question that invites comment.
For an advanced exercise, use a blog post or series of blog posts and invited comments to organize collective action—a meeting, a petition, a boycott, letters to the
Using Wikis for Civic Engagement
A wiki is a Web site or digital document that anyone can edit, using simple markup language
and hyperlinking to create visually consistent, interconnected pages of information. Most
wikis are collaborative Web sites that can be edited by any user, though some require registration or a password. Wikis allow for collaborative communities that can share knowledge
and ideas with minimal technical know-how, so that any user can be a writer, editor, and
content creator and groups can harness collective intelligence to coauthor documents. In
this case, “voice” is not an individual, but a collective expression, which involves structured
debate and discussion about the form a group’s wiki takes.
Wikis were invented about ten years ago by Ward Cunningham, who also created the
name, appropriating the word wiki, which comes from a Hawaiian word for “quick.” Wikis
became the collaboration tool of choice for knowledge-building communities because they
are simple and ﬂexible to create and edit, because every version is saved and easily ﬁndable,
because it is easy to learn the syntax of any wiki by inspecting it via the “edit this page” link
that all wikis have, and because mistakes or damage can be repaired with a single click. A wiki
is the essence of participatory media—a community, not an individual, is the author of many
wiki documents. Such communities can work together to become knowledge communities
and create public goods—Wikipedia ( Page), a volunteercreated encyclopedia that anybody can edit, is the most well-known example of such a
community-created public good. This chapter touches on exercises that enlist the group
Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage Civic Engagement
communication and deliberation process inherent in wiki building for the purpose of civic
decision making.
A Civic Engagement Exercise for High School Students
This issue-based self-government and problem-solving exercise requires students to write
free-form on their user pages in a wiki, invite comment, and then discuss and refactor for
use in actual public wiki pages. First, the class suggests and discusses, then the teacher selects
a topic that appears to be engaging to them. The students then go into a wiki and, on their
individual user pages, write what they think about it (this can be imported or refactored
content from their blogs, or their other past work, if it is relevant and useable). Students
are then asked to rationally and civilly discuss and debate the pros and cons of each other’s
individual work on these user pages, borrowing rules and social norms from existing wiki
communities, when applicable. It is preferable that students actually choose themselves the
rules that they will be governed by. The teacher encourages students to turn parts of their
work into actual pages about the different facets of the subject, and to grow these pages.
Each student is required to create at least two new pages from the note pages he or she
has written in his or her initial work. Each student is also required to add a comment to at
least two other nonuser pages, and instructed on how to refactor his or her comments and
discussion into content on the page itself. All of the student wiki participants are then tasked
with creating one or more joint resolution/proposals about how they think they should be
governed regarding this issue. This wiki exercise could become an integral part of ongoing student involvement in all student issues ,
Investigative blogging (e.g., Trent Lott and Dan Rather incidents),
Hyperlocal journalism (e.g., reporting on local meetings and sporting events), and
Digital storytelling (e.g., narrated oral history and audio–video interviews edited with
scanned still images).
Opportunities for eyewitnesses to introduce their stories, and especially their pictures, into
mainstream media abound. The famous London bombing cameraphone picture was sent
directly to a free Internet photo-sharing service, Flickr ( OhMyNews
accepts international reports and services such as NowPublic ( 
enable citizen-reporters to sell their journalism. Since Kevin Sites started “backpack journalism” blogging from the war in Iraq, freelance war reporting has become a more likely option
for daring independents ( Although it is unlikely that purely
citizen-created journalism will replace mainstream journalism, it is already clear that a niche
In the pre-Internet age of multimedia publishing, pioneer digital storytelling enthusiasts
showed people how to digitize the old photos in their family albums, interview their relatives and digitize the interviews, then arrange the audiovisual elements into a narrative,
often with a voiceover narration. While this technique can be applied to personal genealogy
and history or pure entertainment, digital storytelling, when used to construct a narrative
presentation of true historical events, personages, and geographical locations, is one way
of introducing students to participatory media, to the communication basics of compelling
narrative production, and to local civic affairs. Journalism doesn’t have to be global. Hyperlocal journalism that delves more deeply into local events than mass media does can also
serve as a springboard for civic engagement. See Peter Levine’s chapter in this volume for
more about local community involvement.
Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage Civic Engagement
Susan Johnston at Tam Valley public school in Tamalpais Valley, California, sends elementary school students to record interviews with the people who own and work in
neighborhood stores, as part of a local history of nearby Mill Valley.57 Students take digital photographs, scan old photos from City Hall and the newspaper, then put them together
as hotspots on a clickable map of Mill Valley. Digital storytelling about your immigrant
grandparents, the woman in your community who worked as a maid and sent her children through college, about the hotly contested development of a local historical site, are
all issues in which the fun of putting interviews, found images, photographs, and artwork
together into an entertaining narrative can be combined with serious discussion of public
Learning opportunities can be unlocked by questions that present themselves: In which
part of the digital storytelling process does “public voice” enter into it? In what way do
the decisions about questions to ask, who to interview, and how to edit the interviews
represent a deliberate point of view, a kind of public voice on an issue, represented perhaps
in words other than those of the author, but representing the perspective the author intends
to present? Identifying and discussing the speciﬁc narration, captions, choice of subject
matter, juxtaposition, and editing decisions that present the storyteller’s point of view is a
way of connecting media production practices with a public voice.
Podcasting: From Personal to Public Voice
Audio programs that are recorded and distributed digitally are known as “podcasts,” because
they allow listeners to subscribe online and automatically download each episode to their
computers or portable MP3 players (named for the popular iPod from Apple). Podcasts are
ordinary MP3 ﬁles, like most digital music ﬁles which are compressed so they don’t take
up too much space on listener’s computer drives. You don’t have to own an MP3 player to
listen to podcasts—you can listen to them on your computer, by downloading them or by
streaming the content directly from the podcast’s Web site.
Podcasts are also easy to create and span the range from professionally recorded radio
shows to homegrown audio blogs, music showcases, and social or political commentary. As
such, they are a way for young journalists and advocates to produce and distribute radio
programs inexpensively. The following exercises are intended to introduce a personal voice
and provide pathways for shifting into a public voice via narrative and documentary audio
production.
Before you start, look at what is already out there: has a
number of examples; the chapter’s companion wiki lists other sources and detailed versions
of the following suggested exercises.
First Exercise: Writing a Personal Story
Identify an interesting or poignant story from your own experience (not necessarily about
yourself). Look for something character-based, with conﬂict and resolution. Narrate this
story as a series of anecdotes, and the story under ﬁve minutes long. Pause and reﬂect on
the signiﬁcance of each part of the story—what’s your larger point? It doesn’t have to be
profound. “People love their pets” and “First dates are awkward” are examples of such larger
points. Try to tie the anecdotes together by highlighting the overall relevance of each portion,
and making sure they point to a broader meaning or point. Make notes as you go, and write
a transcript you can read from later. See the Participatory Media wiki for instructions on how
Civic Life Online
to record the transcript you’ve written by reading it aloud, then edit, add music, encode, and
upload your podcast.
Second Exercise: Interviewing
Find a friend who’s done something that interests you—maybe an art project or political
activism or an adventure—and ask to interview them (on tape!). Come up with two or three
main topics you want them to address about their project in your interview. Prepare yourself
with some basic notes outlining the structure of the interview. During the interview, ask
questions to get at the main points you want your interviewee to discuss. Probe to get the
details. As you go, encourage them to be descriptive so your audience can visualize their story
more clearly. As they narrate, raise broader questions to get them to reﬂect on the meaning
of their work, and how it all ties together. Listen to your recording, log key moments, and
then edit it down to half its unedited length. Encode and upload.
Third Exercise: Move to a Public Voice
Now that you have experience, repeat the ﬁrst four exercises, but choose stories, characters,
and issues that relate to some public or civic topic that you care about. Is there no place
for young people to hang out in your town? Talk to young people, local police, local city
council people. Would a skateboard park be a solution? Is there local opposition to a chain
store moving in? Ask about issues that most interest you. Interview people on both sides. A
local election coming up? Is there a candidate or a ballot measure that you care about? Look
up the advocates for both sides and interview them, tell the story of the issue. Be neutral and
journalistic, or advocate a position.
Publish your ﬁnal production as a podcast. Find local bloggers, local news media, or
national bloggers or news media who might ﬁnd your podcast worthy of note in their
publication, use the suggestion forms on their sites or send them e-mails describing your
podcast in the context of their public, along with the URL.
Where to Go from Here
Media technologies and practices are moving too quickly for us to wait for empirical understanding of changed learning and teaching styles before engaging young people with
the civic potential of participatory media: it is important for the future of the public
sphere and the future of the young people who will constitute it that today’s young people should be included—should demand inclusion—in the discussion of how they are to
be educated as citizens. Stephen Coleman states this point eloquently in his chapter in this
Technologies of e-citizenship turn cyberspace into a locus for the contestation of claims about citizenship. Because entry into the virtual public sphere is cheaper and less burdensome than making one’s
presence felt in the conventional public sphere, it is particularly attractive to young people whose experiences and aspirations might otherwise be marginalized or forgotten. The inclusion of these voices
and traditions in the development of e-citizenship is of the utmost importance, if there is a genuine
commitment to cultivate a democratic culture of participation.
Although I advocate an activist approach, I know that we need empirical study of the
fundamental hypotheses underlying the approach I advocate—that active use of networked
media, collaboration in social cyberspaces, and peer production of digital cultural products
Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage Civic Engagement
has changed the way young people learn and that their natural attraction to participatory
media could be used to draw youth into civic engagement. Are these hypotheses borne out
by observation? And what might they mean for the future of learning?
Jonathan Fanton, president of the MacArthur Foundation, succinctly stated the questions
the Digital Media and Learning program is aimed at answering, which strike me as the proper
frame for empirical studies of participatory media:
This is the ﬁrst generation to grow up digital—coming of age in a world where computers, the internet,
videogames, and cell phones are common, and where expressing themselves through these tools is the
norm. Given how present these technologies are in their lives, do young people act, think and learn
differently today? And what are the implications for education and for society?”58
Both research and practice will be required before the pedagogical strategy advocated
in this chapter can be fully evaluated for eventual abandonment or wider adoption. The
wiki that accompanies the chapter is a vehicle for accomplishing that evaluation and for
increasing the value of resources found there. If you know about recent research that adds
to what we know about the effectiveness of participatory media in increasing youthful civic
engagement, share it on the wiki. If you have tried the exercises suggested here and ﬁnd
that they work well or not at all, share what you know on the wiki. If you know additional
exercises, additional resources, additional pedagogical issues, share them on the wiki. Invest
a small amount of value, harvest a much larger amount, the way Wikipedians do. That’s how
a cornucopia of the commons can work.

to acknowledge data that indicates signiﬁcant racial, socioeconomic, and gender differences in opportunity and engagement. It appears that multiple “digital divides” have to be taken into account, as well.
Moreover, the deﬁnition of youth is contentious, socially constructed, and changing. See Brandi L. Bell,
Children, Youth, and Civic (dis)Engagement: Digital Technology and Citizenship ; and Eszter Hargittai, Just a Pretty Face(book)? What College Students Actually Do Online, in

needs of those young people who are indeed demonstrating enthusiasm for digital media. Perhaps the
resources provided in this chapter and the supporting Web site can be adopted for use in multiple social
environments. Questions of which issues young people care about, the social assumptions and skill sets
that they bring to media practices, and equality of opportunity and access will differ from group to
group, but perhaps the core skills of media production and distribution can be useful (or adapted to be
more useful) in many contexts.

A Public Voice for Youth: The Audience Problem in Digital Media
and Civic Education
Peter Levine
University of Maryland, CIRCLE (Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning
& Engagement)
Students should have opportunities to create digital media in schools. This is a promising
way to enhance their civic engagement, which comprises political activism, deliberation,
problem solving, and participation in shaping a culture. All these forms of civic engagement
require the effective use of a public voice, which should be taught as part of digital media education. To provide digital media courses that teach civic engagement will mean overcoming
several challenges, including a lack of time, funding, and training. An additional problem is
especially relevant to the question of public voice. Students must ﬁnd appropriate audiences
for their work in a crowded media environment dominated by commercial products. The
chapter concludes with strategies for building audiences, the most difﬁcult but promising
of which is to turn adolescents’ ofﬂine communities—especially high schools—into more
genuine communities.
Why Do We Need Civic Engagement?
A good society cannot be governed by a few, even if the governors were skillful, ethical,
and representative of the whole society. We always need broad civic engagement, for four
important reasons.
First, evidence shows that institutions work better when many people participate. For
example, Robert Putnam has shown that American “states where citizens meet, join, vote,
and trust in unusual measure boast consistently higher educational performance than states
where citizens are less engaged with civic and community life.” Putnam ﬁnds that such
engagement is “by far” a bigger correlate of educational outcomes than is spending on
education, teachers’ salaries, class size, or demographics.1 Likewise, the most successful
activist governments in the world—the Nordic social democracies—also have among the
world’s highest rates of voting, signing petitions, boycotting, joining protests, and reading the newspaper. On the other hand, strong governments with weak civil societies are,
without exceptions, corrupt and tyrannical.2 It seems likely that active citizens check corruption and mismanagement. They also reduce the burdens on public institutions, such as
schools, by lending their own passions, ideas, and labor. Governments work better when people communicate among themselves about public problems. As Lewis A. Friedland writes,
“Communities in which there are rich, cross-cutting networks of association and public
discussion are more likely to formulate real problems, apply and test . . . solutions, learn
from them, and correct them if they are ﬂawed: in short, to rule themselves, or work
democratically.”3
Civic Life Online
Second, social outcomes are more likely to be just when participation is equitable. People
who vote and otherwise engage in politics and civil society tend to get a better deal, and
that is a reason to encourage everyone to participate. For example, in one survey, all the
respondents who had ever received a federal small-business loan said they always vote. They
represented a relatively wealthy stratum of society that qualiﬁed for business assistance. In
contrast, just over half of those who received welfare or public assistance claimed always to
vote. These turnout estimates are probably inﬂated, but the gap of 44.4 percentage points
between the two groups is consistent with other research.4 A task force of the American
Political Science Association recently found that people with education and money have far
more than an equal share of inﬂuence on government.5
Third, some crucial public problems can only be addressed by people’s direct public work,
not by legislation.6 Effective governments are capable of redistributing money and deﬁning
and punishing crimes. But many important problems call for persuasion, guidance, contestation, and other forms of “voice,” accompanied by citizens’ concrete action. For example,
to change public attitudes toward gender roles or to encourage young people to value academic knowledge are goals that require persuasion and argumentation along with examples
of personal behavior. Rarely can governments reduce prejudice, enhance the appreciation
of nature, or deliver personalized care. Although governments express values through laws
and institutions, their ability to persuade is severely limited. Besides, liberal states are not
permitted to offer certain persuasive arguments (such as those that explicitly favor particular
religious views or that invoke ethnic solidarity). Voluntary public work expresses values in
ways that are sensitive to context and embodied in human behavior and relationships. Public
work thus plays an essential role in deﬁning and addressing social problems.
Public and Private Voice
All of these purposes of civic engagement are best served when people deliberate before they
act, expressing opinions to some body of peers in an appropriate voice. Styles of communication differ profoundly by culture and context, but a public voice is always one that can
persuade other people—beyond one’s closest friends and family—to take action on shared
issues. As Howard Rheingold notes in this volume, “Moving from a private voice to a public voice can help students [or anyone else] turn their self-expression into a form of public
participation.”
An example of a very private voice is an e-mail or a social networking site that is meant for
close associates of the author. It may include personal references that would be obscure to
a casual visitor; it is not intended to interest a community or to address their concerns. An
example of a public voice is a political blog in which the author, much like a conventional
newspaper columnist, expresses opinions on the issues of the day and hopes to draw a massive
or inﬂuential audience. There are many mixed and intermediate forms as well—both ofﬂine
and online.
Some contemporary political theorists deﬁne public communication in highly stringent
and demanding ways. According to Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson (drawing on
J¨urgen Habermas and others), to speak publicly imposes a set of obligations.7 When in
the public sphere, one must advance arguments that any rational person can accept. That
means that one may not express arbitrary opinions, assert purely selﬁsh interests, or appeal to
authorities—such as Scripture—that others reject. One may not shift positions when speaking
to different audiences or give reasons that contradict one’s conclusions. On this view, the
A Public Voice for Youth
public speaker is a kind of ethical and rational legislator, addressing an assembly of peers on
matters of public concern.8
These deﬁnitions seem much too stringent for the practical purpose of this chapter, which
is teaching young people to be reasonably effective in public domains. Indeed, as Stephen
Coleman notes in this volume, idealized standards of public communication have two serious
drawbacks. They impose norms that people are supposed to internalize and use for selfregulation, at some cost to their spontaneity, diversity, and freedom. And they teach a style
of political engagement that would be na¨ıve and ineffective “in any real political party, trade
union, or local council.” Hence my looser deﬁnition of a public voice as any style or tone that
has a chance of persuading any other people (outside of one’s intimate circle) about shared
matters, issues, or problems.
This broad deﬁnition encompasses topics beyond conventional politics. For example, bad
software is a shared concern, and one can write a blog to explain to others how to ﬁx technical
problems. Poor customer service can be a public issue if one chooses to address or organize
one’s fellow customers instead of complaining privately to the company. (See the chapter
by Jennifer Earl and Alan Schussman on consumer petitions, which often adopt rhetorical
styles drawn from conventional politics.) In these cases, one’s voice is public even though
the issues belong to the private sector.
We may disagree about which topics are legitimate for public discussion. For instance, disclosing one’s own sexual history may be inappropriate—or it may be a means of challenging
prejudices and limits. Despite these disagreements, however, it is pretty clear that standard
instant-messaging chatter is (or ought to be) private. But most good blogs are public. And
effective citizens need to understand the difference.
Culture, Media, and Democracy
The previous section on deliberation and public voice implies that to be civically engaged is
to address matters of policy or politics. However, civic engagement is a broader concept that
also comprises cultural production.
A democratic people not only controls its own government’s budget, laws, and relations
with foreign nations; it also shapes its own identity and self-image. Any self-governing
community must be able to illustrate and memorialize its values and present its identity
to outsiders and future generations of its own people. This is true at the level of a nation,
but also in a small community such as the student body of a school. Thus, civic engagement
includes the production of culture, at least insofar as cultural expression shapes norms and
priorities.
Truly engaged citizens produce heterogeneous cultural products. Engaged people clump
together in communities and associations, each of which inevitably takes on a distinct
character. Many communities and associations choose to display their identities through
music, statuary, graphic design, narrative history, and other forms of culture. But cultural
identity is always contested; it provokes debates, parodies, and expressions of dissent as well
as consensus. In other words, it requires the use of a public voice to defend or criticize forms
of expression.
While heterogeneity is evidence of civic engagement, a homogeneous mass culture is a
threat to democracy: when only a few people produce products that reach a mass market,
they obtain great inﬂuence. Today, various groups of Americans criticize mass culture for
being secular, materialistic, superﬁcial, violent, sexist, and racist and for undermining local,
Civic Life Online
traditional, and minority cultures. These critiques are not always mutually consistent and
may not all be valid. But it seems clear that people feel powerless to change mass culture,
and that feeling demonstrates the tension between mass culture and democracy.
Mass culture is, in part, a product of corporate capitalism. Capital increases the audiences
for certain books, ﬁlms, and songs. Sometimes corporate power is relatively weak: for instance, when there is competition among many producers (as in the Jacksonian era of small
printers or in today’s age of blogs) or when the government sponsors cultural production
(as in Western Europe today). However, there remains an intrinsic tendency for liberal and
democratic societies to develop mass cultures.
When people are free to choose which cultural products to consume, we often observe
a “power law” distribution, in which a small handful of products are enormously more
popular than the rest. It is not certain why this occurs, but it seems plausible that people
want to know what other people are reading, hearing, or viewing; thus they gravitate to
what is already popular, making it more so. That instinct is perhaps especially strong in a
democracy, where people are taught to believe that average or majority opinion is a reliable
guide to quality. Books are advertised as best sellers, movies as blockbusters, and songs as hits
because democratic audiences trust popularity. In aristocratic cultures, on the other hand,
elites have disproportionate consumer power and tend to view popularity as a mark of poor
quality. Aristocrats want to have uncommon tastes. As Tocqueville wrote,
Among aristocratic nations every man is pretty nearly stationary in his own sphere, but men are astonishingly unlike each other; their passions, their notions, and their tastes are essentially different: nothing
changes, but everything differs. In democracies, on the contrary, all men are alike and do things pretty
nearly alike. It is true that they are subject to great and frequent vicissitudes, but as the same events
of good or averse fortune are continually recurring, only the name of the actors is changed, the piece
is always the same. The aspect of American society is animated because men and things are always
changing, but it is monotonous because all these changes are alike.9
Tocqueville thought that mass culture posed a serious threat to liberty, but he proposed a
solution. Strong voluntary associations would have the means and the incentive to produce
differentiated alternatives to mass culture. Members of associations would want to communicate with one another about common concerns and collaborate in producing cultural
products primarily for themselves. In that way, civic engagement—meaning especially group
membership—would diversify the culture.
Cultural Production in the Era of Networks
The Internet does not make Tocqueville’s argument irrelevant, but it creates new opportunities and challenges for the participatory cultural production that he valued. During the
second half of the twentieth century, voluntary associations weakened, American communities became more alike, and corporate media dominated. More recently, however, the
Internet and other new electronic media have allowed people to produce and disseminate
their own ideas, which can be diverse and relevant to their communities (geographical or
otherwise). Never has it been as cheap or quick to generate text, sound, or moving images for
public access. This opportunity for creativity has great civic potential; it could turn people
from spectators and consumers into innovators and creators.10
On the other hand, the same technology that allows millions of people to produce public
materials also gives them easier and quicker access to the most popular digital products—
whether music, video, or political news and statements. A few items gain global audiences.
A Public Voice for Youth
They often feature talented celebrities who are backed by technical experts and corporate
funding. Although some corporate products fail in the marketplace, they have the best odds
of obtaining a large audience.
The easy availability of celebrity culture could reduce demand for ordinary people’s creativity and make the world more homogeneous, thus frustrating local communities (and
even whole nations) that want to govern their own cultures. The more that slick, professional products penetrate the international market, the less scope exists for ordinary people
to create cultural products that others will value.
This shift is not the result of corporate investment alone. Not many of the successful blogs
that arose between 2000 and 2002 had signiﬁcant ﬁnancial backing or famous writers; none
used complex software that was out of the reach of ordinary users. Nevertheless, a handful of
these blogs drew, and have retained, an enormous proportion of the total trafﬁc. Instapundit,
for example, became thousands of times more popular than average conservative blogs, and
it is hard to believe that it was that much better than the average. An alternative explanation
for its popularity involves path dependence: people want to know what the most popular
sites are saying. Thus, what is already popular tends to become more so.11 Path dependence
plus corporate investment combine to produce a web in which a few disseminate ideas to
the many—increasingly reminiscent of radio and television.
Some early enthusiasts for the Internet assumed (with the Supreme Court in Reno v. ACLU)
that everyone with a computer could become a “pamphleteer,” putting ideas into the public
arena that would reach audiences simply in proportion to their relevance, value, or popularity. In that case, the popularity of Web sites would follow a bell curve, with more sites near
the median than near the tails.
But Yochai Benkler rejects such “mid-1990s utopianism.”12 A few sites are enormously
more popular than the median, and there is a long tail in which sites show little evidence
of an audience at all. For example, the median blog currently tracked by Truth Laid Bear (a
popular ranking service) has two incoming links, whereas the top blog has 4,696. Figure 1
shows the incoming links of top-ranked blogs, revealing a precipitous decline.
Early papers that discovered this power-law took a skeptical or critical line. The Internet
was not a democracy or a meritocracy. Rather, people and search engines linked to sites that
were already popular, thus making them more so. The rich got richer, regardless of merit. But
Benkler summarizes ﬁndings that are more optimistic than a pure power law theory would
imply. Mathematical models of the Web suggest that unknown sites do rise in popularity, and
popular ones fall. There are many stories about innovations in tactics, techniques, or ideas
that spread very rapidly. For instance, BoycottSBG—a response to the Sinclair Broadcasting
Group’s alleged Republican bias—obtained enormous participation within a week. As Benkler
says, “It was providing a solution that resonated with the political beliefs of many people
and was useful to them for their expression and mobilization.”13
Benkler observes a “self-organizing principle” on the World Wide Web.14 People with
strong mutual afﬁnities ﬁnd one another and link their Web sites or leave comments on
each other’s pages. Within these afﬁnity groups, some sites become more popular than
others. But (a) there are many afﬁnity groups, and (b) the popularity curve is not always
steep within a group. “When the topically or organizationally related clusters become small
enough—on the order of hundreds or even low thousands of Web pages—they no longer
follow a pure power law distribution. Instead, they follow a distribution that still has a very
long tail—these smaller clusters still have a few genuine ‘superstars’—but the body of the
distribution is substantially more moderate: beyond the few superstars, the shape of the link
distribution looks a little more like a normal distribution.”15

Clusters of afﬁnity groups then aggregate, often through sites that are or become superstars.
We thus see a highly skewed distribution of popularity on the Internet as whole, yet the Web
remains plural and open because of all the smaller groups. As Benkler says, “There is a big
difference between a situation where no one is looking at any of the sites on the low end of
the distribution, because everyone is looking only at the superstars, and a situation where
dozens or hundreds of sites at the low end are looking at each other, as well as at the
superstars.”16 On Benkler’s model, “ﬁltering for the network as a whole is done as a form
of nested peer-review decisions, beginning with the speaker’s closest information afﬁnity
group.”17 Lively dialogues begin “with communities of interest on smallish scales, practices
of mutual pointing, and the fact that, with freedom to choose what to see and who to link
to, with some codependence among the choices of individuals as to whom to link, highly
connected points emerge even at small scales, and continue to be replicated with ever-larger
visibility as the clusters grow.”18
Benkler’s portrait of the Internet permits cautious optimism about its value for Tocquevillian associational life. The Net does not give everyone an equal audience, let alone a large
one, but it offers more opportunities for cultural creativity, cooperation, and effective public
voice than the mass media system that prevailed twenty years ago.
Why Should We Be Especially Concerned about Youth Civic Engagement?
So far, this chapter has emphasized that many people should express their views on public
issues and help create a heterogeneous democratic culture. I now turn to adolescents, whose
civic participation is especially important.
Contrary to popular stereotypes about “slackers,” today’s youngest generation of Americans are in some ways quite civically engaged. For
example, according to separate surveys collected by Monitoring the Future and the Higher
Education Research Institute, American youth have become increasingly likely to volunteer.
According to the DDB Lifestyles Survey, there was a substantial gap between the volunteering
A Public Voice for Youth
rates of older people and youth in the 1970s, but that gap has vanished. Also, whereas the
whole U.S. population has become distinctly less likely to participate in a community project
since the 1970s, the rate among youth has been unchanged over that time.19
Young Americans are heavily represented in innovative online activities such as blogging
and wikis. In 2004, The Pew Internet & American Life Project identiﬁed a group of Power
Creators who each created online material in an average of two different ways: for instance,
maintaining a personal site and also posting on other sites. This group had a median age of
twenty-ﬁve. Since the youngest people surveyed were eighteen, the real median was certainly
lower.20 A year later, the project found that 17 percent of teenagers (deﬁned as ages twelve
to seventeen) had created their own blogs, compared to 7 percent of adults.21
In some other respects, however, youth are less engaged compared to past generations. For
example, their news consumption and interest in public events fell deeply and consistently
over the last thirty-ﬁve years. The big drop in news consumption occurred in the 1980s,
before the Internet. Young Americans’ voter turnout fell by one third in the three decades
after 1972 (the ﬁrst year in which eighteen- to twenty-one-year-olds were allowed to vote),
while older people’s turnout showed no decline.
Given the importance, noted above, of using a public voice, we should assess the degree
to which young people express themselves publicly. Among the nineteen survey indicators
of civic engagement that Scott Keeter et al. developed in 2003, ﬁve are activities that require
individuals to express their own political or social opinions in public forums (persuading
others about an election, participating in community problem solving, contacting an elected
ofﬁcial, contacting a newspaper or magazine, and calling a talk show). Several other indicators
measure participation in public discourse (e.g., taking part in a protest, displaying a campaign
sign, button, or sticker).22 For most of these indicators, youth were not heavily involved.
People do not naturally or automatically acquire an effective public voice or the motivation
to use it. They must be taught.
We might debate whether, overall, youth civic engagement has improved or declined
in the United States and other countries: that would depend on how we weigh the various
forms of engagement. Regardless, we should try to strengthen youth participation, for several
First, as John Dewey observed, young people are relatively “plastic.”23 Adolescents develop
habits and attitudes relevant to civic life when they ﬁrst encounter the world of news,
issues, and events. During that initial period, their ideas are ﬂexible and subject to inﬂuence.
However, once they develop a political identity, it cannot be changed without much effort
and discomfort. As Karl Mannheim noted in the 1920s, “Even if the rest of one’s life consisted
in one long process of negation and destruction of the natural world view acquired in
youth, the determining inﬂuence of these early impressions would still be predominant.”24
Longitudinal data show remarkable persistence in adults’ political behaviors and beliefs over
the decades of their lives, whereas young people seem susceptible to change.25 For example,
careful studies have found that giving high school students opportunities to participate in
extracurricular groups enhances their civic participation many decades later.26
Second, young people have special needs that can be met by encouraging them to participate in civic and political affairs. There is a strong correlation between adolescents’ civic
engagement and successful development. For instance, using three national longitudinal
surveys, Nicholas Zill and colleagues found, “Compared to those who reported spending
1–4 hours per week in extracurricular activities, students who reported spending no time
in school-sponsored activities were 57 percent more likely to have dropped out by the time
Civic Life Online
they would have been seniors; 49 percent more likely to have used drugs; 37 percent more
likely to have become teen parents; 35 percent more likely to have smoked cigarettes; and
27 percent more likely to have been arrested.” These relationships remained statistically signiﬁcant even after the researchers controlled for other measured characteristics of families,
schools, and students (such as parents’ education levels), and similar results have emerged
from other studies.27
One explanation is that young people respond well to being given responsibilities and opportunities to serve their communities. In fact, there is some evidence that adults can address
adolescent pathologies better by providing civic opportunities than by trying to detect, prevent, and mitigate problems. For instance, the Teen Outreach Program (TOP) signiﬁcantly
reduced teen pregnancy, school suspension, and school failure. TOP was successful even
though it focused “very little attention on the three target problem behavior outcomes.” In
other words, the staff did not directly address pregnancy or school-related problems. Instead,
youth in the program were enrolled in service projects and asked to discuss their work in
classroom settings. An average of 45.8 hours of service reduced teen pregnancy through the
indirect means of giving young women valuable civic work to do.28 The TOP experiment
provides evidence in support of the philosophy known as “positive youth development,”
which emphasizes adolescents’ need to contribute their talents and energy.
Another argument begins with the observation that youth have a quasi-autonomous culture. Variation in that culture can have enormous impact on kids. For example, it makes
a huge difference whether one participates in a gang or a chess club. But adults and adult
institutions are not able to manipulate youth culture. Therefore, it is important for young
people to develop their own civic skills. Then, for example, they will be able to do their own
conﬂict mediation and violence prevention within their own peer groups. If young people
are helped to develop civic motivations, they may create associations that have positive
purposes and are attractive to peers.
Finally, American youth are particularly susceptible to being inﬂuenced by corporatefunded mass culture, which is aimed directly at them even though it reaches a global audience. For that very reason, they have special leverage over media corporations, especially if
they act cooperatively. It is not an exaggeration to say that youth civic engagement in the
United States could beneﬁt democracy around the world if youth-led associations challenged
mass culture.
Why Would We Expect Media Production to Boost Youth Civic Skills?
There are not yet enough rigorous evaluations of youth media programs, especially in school
settings. We need studies that use control or comparison groups and that measure civic
outcomes. However, convergent evidence from similar projects suggests that youth media
could be highly effective for teaching public voice and might also boost academic skills.
Service learning means a combination of community service and academic work or classroom discussion; it is now present in half of American high schools.29 A 1999 evaluation
found that federally funded service learning had positive effects on students’ civic attitudes,
habits of volunteering, and success in school.30 In a smaller study published in 2005, Shelley
Billig and colleagues found that students who had been exposed to service learning gained
more knowledge of civics and government and felt more conﬁdent about their own civic
skills, compared to a matched group of students who had taken conventional social studies
classes.31
A Public Voice for Youth
Earthforce is a school-based program that involves students in environmental research
and political action. Students choose their own issues and strategies. Earthforce was evaluated by Alan Melchior and Lawrence Neil Bailis in 2001–2002, using pre and post student
questionnaires, teacher questionnaires, and focus groups (but no comparison groups or testlike assessments). There were many positive changes in self-reported skills, knowledge, and
attitudes over the course of the program, and teachers were favorable.32
These and other studies support the view that active civic participation is an inspiring
and effective approach to civic education that also enhances academic skills and engages
youth in their schooling. They are tests of what Marina Bers calls “praxis-based” rather than
“knowledge-based” civic education. Some of the examples (especially Earthforce) are what
she calls constructionist rather than instructionist.
It is important to note, however, that the evaluations cited above were limited to programs
that appeared to be well implemented. Many other programs that receive service-learning
funds do not implement basic recommendations, such as offering students opportunities
for reﬂection.33 Even having screened out weaker programs, Billig and colleagues found
a great range in impact. Their study underlines the importance of quality. Active learning can be counterproductive unless projects are well conceived and executed. And even
the best programs can have mixed effects. For instance, youth participants in Earthforce
gained skills but became less conﬁdent in their own civic efﬁcacy over the course of the
program. Their agreement with the following statements actually declined: “I believe I can
personally make a difference in my school or community,” “I believe that people working together can solve community problems,” “It is important to listen to people on all
sides of a community issue if we want to ﬁnd a solution that will work,” “I think it is
more important to look for ways to help the environment for a long time than to do
something that will just make a difference for a few days,” and “I pay attention to local
environmental issues when I hear about them.” The evaluators conclude, “One possible
explanation is that the decline reﬂects an increased understanding on the part of participants of how slow and difﬁcult change can be, and that participants are both more realistic
and in some cases discouraged by the challenges they face in addressing issues in their
communities.”
Similar results would likely be found if digital media production were evaluated using
surveys and other quantitative measures. There would be a range of outcomes depending on
the quality of the programs; and even some of the best would reduce students’ efﬁcacy by
confronting them with obdurate social problems.
Youth Media Production in the School Context
Much of the exciting youth media work that one can ﬁnd by searching on the Web is created
in after-school and community-based programs that have support from foundations. These
projects are crucial laboratories and will play a lasting role by allowing youth to undertake
projects too controversial for schools. For example, Raices is an initiative of the Main Street
Project that helps Latino youth in rural Midwestern communities to make digital media.
Amalia Anderson, director of the initiative, told me that “our media work is grounded in
a right to communicate, to challenge the camera as a tool of colonization, and to use our
voices to speak truth to power as well as preserve and protect our culture, languages and
identity.”34 That kind of mission would have to be submerged in a typical comprehensive
public school.
Civic Life Online
However, most adolescents do not have opportunities for community-based engagement;
and voluntary projects always draw self-selected youth. Therefore, school-based programs
are essential if we want to reach a broad spectrum of students, including youth who don’t
ﬁnd their way into after-school programs.
In their study of civic learning among Chicago public school students, Kahne and Sporte
found small positive effects from community-based projects, but very large positive effects
from service learning in the schools. This is striking, because most service-learning classes are
often not very ambitious or engaging, whereas Chicago is a hotbed of excellent communitybased youth work. But the youth who have the most to gain do not sign up for after-school
programs, and they appear to beneﬁt from service learning in their public schools. It is likely
that they would also beneﬁt from youth media courses.35
There is a substantial base on which to build digital media production classes that could
reach all American students. In the Knight Foundation’s Future of the First Amendment
survey, 21 percent of randomly selected schools said that they had a “Student Internet
or World-Wide Web publication with a news component that requires students to make
judgments about what is newsworthy.”36 The question was framed so that it missed some
other forms of digital media production of civic value. Thus more than one in ﬁve schools
may have relevant programs in place today.
Nevertheless, many obstacles stand in the way of adequate opportunities in schools. Some
problems, such as the lack of equipment and trained teachers, could be addressed with
more public investment. Of course, providing adequate support is a challenge, given budget
deﬁcits, opposition to taxes, competing priorities, a history of underinvestment in many
school districts, and a system of predominantly local educational funding that leaves poor
communities with scarce resources for schooling. However, youth media production could
be allocated a larger proportion of existing money and—just as important—of students’ time.
Schools are increasingly inﬂuenced by research, because state legislation and the No Child
Left Behind Act 2003 (NCLB) require them to achieve speciﬁed outcomes, and they are
looking for tested ways to do so. By showing that youth media production improves academic
skills or high school completion, researchers could persuade school districts to invest in
equipment and professional development and to provide instructional time.
We have circumstantial evidence that would support this case. Many students drop out
because the assigned work is boring and because they lack personal connections to teachers.
For instance, in a 2006 study of recent dropouts, more than half said they had satisfactory
grades before they left school (C or better), but half said that classes were boring. Furthermore,
“only 56 percent said they could go to a staff person for school problems and just two-ﬁfths
(41 percent) had someone in school to talk to about personal problems.”37 There have been
rigorous evaluations of programs—albeit not media production courses—that help students
to work on community problems in collaboration with adults. For instance, an evaluation
of the Quantum Opportunities Program (QOP) studied randomly selected students and a
control group. For about $2,500 a year over four years, QOP was able to cut the dropout
rate to 23 percent, compared to 50 percent for the control group. QOP’s approach included
academic programs that were individually paced for each student, mandatory community
service, enrichment programs, and pay for each hour of participation.38
We also have anecdotes about media production classes that may have prevented individuals from dropping out. For example, in an evaluation of the Educational Video Center
(EVC), one student said, “EVC helped me stay in school. Like last year, I was really going to
drop out but . . . the teachers [at EVC] are like so cool I was able to go to them and talk to
A Public Voice for Youth
them and tell them what was going on in my life, tell them all my problems.”39 Participants
also reported gains in skills and academic engagement.
I ﬁnd such testimony promising, especially since it is consistent with fairly relevant experimental results (noted above) and the theory of positive youth development.40 However,
administrators who control scarce resources will not place large bets on youth media production on the basis of such evidence. They may suspect that (a) students who sign up for
voluntary media programs already have positive attitudes and skills on entry, (b) students’
self-reports of skills are unreliable, (c) participants are generous in their evaluations of programs, and (d) other opportunities for student engagement, such as service learning, have
been better researched. To inﬂuence educational policy, I believe we need randomized ﬁeld
experiments that measure the impact of digital media creation on relatively hard measures,
such as high school completion or valid and reliable measures of skills.
If such experiments showed positive results, then NCLB and the standards movement that
it typiﬁes would provide some leverage. But these laws also create a challenge by focusing
on basic literacy and mathematics as measured by pencil-and-paper tests. That focus makes
it harder to devote instructional time to media production; media skills are not directly
tested, yet what is tested is taught. Nevertheless, NCLB and other current policies could
accommodate youth media work if we could show that providing creative opportunities is
an efﬁcient way to keep kids engaged in school.
The Audience Problem
I do not pretend that the struggle for adequate resources will be easy. However, in the rest of
this chapter, I will address a different issue that is more complex and less amenable to being
solved with money alone: the audience problem.
As noted above, democracy requires broad and diverse cultural creativity. The new digital
media—Web sites, e-mail, digital cameras, digital voice recorders and video cameras, and the
like—offer opportunities for individuals and voluntary groups to create their own cultural
products and to use a public voice, and many have done so. However, the technology is
not enough; people must also want to create—and speciﬁcally to make products with public
purposes—rather than use the Internet to get access to mass-produced culture.
One important motivator is the belief that one can reach other people: an audience. Not
everyone wants to maximize the sheer number of people reached, although the popularity
of Site Meter and other tools for counting visits suggests that some do care about numbers.
But others may be more interested in ﬁnding a responsive audience that provides comments
and feedback; or they may seek a politically relevant audience that can act in response to
their media. (A politically relevant audience might comprise especially inﬂuential people,
such as reporters and elected ofﬁcials, or it might consist of fellow members of a community
who could act collectively.)
In any case, we communicate in a public voice in order to address someone, and it matters
who listens. It is discouraging to build something if no one comes. As Howard Rheingold says,
“Teachers would do well to ask ‘are [students] connecting with others?’ as well as asking ‘are
they expressing themselves?’ when evaluating the outcome of digital media project-based
learning.”41
Global Action Project (GAP) is an independent nonproﬁt that teaches media production
to youth in several countries so that they can “use their media as a catalyst for dialogue and
social change.”42 In response to my query, Megan McDermott, the GAP director, asked a
Civic Life Online
group of participants whether and why an audience was important to them. According to
her notes, they said that they needed people to watch their videos in order to affect the social
issues that concerned them: “Because that’s how we’re going to make it work to open up the
audience’s eyes.” Students also wanted honest feedback from an attentive group, “because
it lets you know if your video is hot or not . . . . They give feedback and point out things you
might miss in your own ﬁlm. They give feedback that might be good and can make your
video or ﬁlm better.”43
McDermott said that youth in GAP are encouraged to think about their audience from the
beginning of their projects. At ﬁrst, they want to reach everyone, but then they ﬁne-tune
their goals to be more realistic and to enhance their impact on their communities. They are
less concerned, she said, with the number of viewers than with the kind of conversations
that they provoke.
EVC is “dedicated to the creative and community-based use of video and multi-media as
a means to develop the literacy, research, public speaking and work preparation skills of atrisk youth.”44 EVC’s executive director Steven Goodman told me, “Students certainly enjoy
knowing that their work will be seen by audiences. . . . I’m sure the students prefer larger
audiences but respond more to the quality of audience response and engagement. . . . At
EVC, a responsive audience is one which gives the students positive feedback, asks a lot of
questions, and is engaged in the screening. The students do look for this kind of engagement
and feel their work may not have been received well if it is lacking.”45
The Community Arts Center Teen Media Program in Cambridge, MA, holds an annual
festival to screen student videos. According to written questionnaires, students were pleased
with the event but more satisﬁed with the turnout than the quality of the discussion. “The
crowd on Friday was a highlight—‘lots of people.’” “Some of the questions in the discussion
were good, but some were stupid.”46
Anderson of the Main Street Project concurred that numbers weren’t as important as
“having the right audience—not just an audience for the sake of people to watch. In my
experience youth are most interested in making sure their work (stories) are ﬁrst screened
with family and friends and other people of color. Since their work is often personal, and because they have learned through the workshops the importance of people of color telling our
own stories and speaking for ourselves . . . they are far more interested in thinking through
where the community screenings will take place, and how sharing their stories can empower others, challenge isolation and lead to organizing campaigns.” She added that they
want audiences who have deep respect for their work and who can participate in creating
Creating Audiences for Youth Media Products
Given the media environment sketched above, I am concerned that we may set kids up for
disappointment when we imply that the Internet will make them pamphleteers or broadcasters who can change the world by reaching relevant people. Even if some kids are highly
successful, most will not draw a signiﬁcant or appropriate or responsive audience. Most Web
sites remain in the tail of the distribution. If you create a site that hardly anyone visits, you
will get little feedback. Kids who build such sites may feel that they are failures, especially
in a culture that prizes popularity. That is why efforts to draw friends and to advertise (or
exaggerate) the size of one’s network are so prominent on social networking sites such as
A Public Voice for Youth
The topics that young people know best are very local. For instance, when the Lower
Eastside Girls Club in New York City began podcasting, they chose to create an audio segment on school uniforms. This was important to them, but not to many others. Even their
most likely audience, their fellow students, seemed to shun their amateur work in favor
of professional digital media. Other kids across the country are concerned about school
uniforms, but they have no reason to listen to a podcast on that subject from New York
Students are unlikely to obtain a substantial audience through sheer talent or innovation. Some kids will, but the average won’t. Furthermore, many adolescents do not belong
to tight afﬁnity groups, differentiated from the mass youth population. Benkler mentions
“communities of interest on smallish scales” that conduct peer review and create audiences
by linking to one another. But adolescents do not automatically have such communities.
The typical U.S. high school is a massive and anonymous institution to which students feel
no attachment. Kids have common concerns, but they tend to share them with millions of
others. Mass media culture is profoundly homogenizing.
Four Strategies
In this ﬁnal section, I explore four responses to the audience problem, each of which has
some promise.
The ﬁrst response is to create highly interactive, gamelike environments in which youth
can express public views and do civic work. An example is Zora, as described by Bers in
this volume. Student participants in Zora clearly have an audience—the other players. The
question is whether schools can be encouraged to devote signiﬁcant amounts of instructional
time to such activities. They would have to be shown that playing Zora advances some of
the objectives for which they are held accountable, such as reading test scores or retention
in school.
The second response is to expand audiences by marketing youth products or by organizing
face-to-face events. This appears to be a common strategy in the foundation-supported,
community-based groups. Often, they organize screenings so that youth can get feedback.
Goodman of EVC described premiere screenings at which 50–150 people convene face-to-face
to watch student videos. He reported, “Our students almost always come away from their
screenings feeling a sense of accomplishment, pride, success and recognition they never
experience in school or elsewhere in their life. These are times when their parents, friends
and teachers see their creative and intellectual potential; the audiences see what they are
truly capable of, and the students are just overjoyed.”
McDermott of GAP said that adult audiences often ask unhelpful questions, such as, “Why
did you choose this topic?” or “Do you want to be a professional ﬁlm-maker?” The youth in
GAP have begun to circulate better questions in advance, such as, “What can we do about the
problem that you have presented in your video?” or “What were the strongest and weakest
parts of the documentary?” Apparently, adults appreciate such guidance.
Most of this discussion and feedback occurs in face-to-face settings. McDermott described a
public screening of a youth-made video about gentriﬁcation that drew academic experts, activists, and some of the kids’ parents and friends. The discussion was very rich and rewarding
for the young ﬁlmmakers. Overall, McDermott thought that youth were both satisﬁed and
dissatisﬁed with their audience—glad for the feedback they received, but not fully satisﬁed
by their impact on their communities.
Civic Life Online
A strategy of recruiting face-to-face audiences makes good sense for community-based
groups that also want to achieve social change by organizing residents. Their leaders have
the skills and motivation to follow through once students have created media projects. If
they were unable or unwilling to convene residents, their whole strategy of social change
would make no sense.
However, I worry that this strategy will not work well in schools, particularly if media
production becomes more common. In general, teachers are not trained or supported—or
even allowed—to convene community meetings. Besides, if we could massively enlarge the
number of youth who were involved in media production in schools, we would ﬁnd it
increasingly hard to ﬁnd audiences for their work.
A third strategy is to enable students to create digital media products with relatively
low investments of time and expertise. When J-Lab, the Center for Interactive Journalism,
offered mini-grants for citizen journalism, scores of youth-oriented projects applied, asking
for support to build ambitious online products such as GIS maps of gentriﬁcation or databases
of video interviews. Youth who
commit the time necessary for such projects will be sorely disappointed if no one uses their
work. However, one can produce public media without that much investment. Whereas a
custom-built Web site is a huge job, one can launch a site on MySpace or create a blog within
DailyKos in a few minutes.
Luke Walker, education project manager of TakingITGlobal, writes: “The ‘old’ model of
spending hours/days/weeks creating a website, securing server space, and sharing it for all (or
no one) to see is both outdated and largely irrelevant for the average young person, although
it’s still happening far too often in the school context. As long as that is the production model
that teachers are using in their classes, then yes, we are setting children up for failure and
disappointment—particularly if we’re stopping at the point of posting the content on the
web (where many people’s knowledge/expertise ends) and not teaching students to employ
all the marketing tactics that make commercial/mainstream/high-proﬁle websites successful.
More and more, though, young people are moving away from traditional websites to creating
a presence in social networking spaces like MySpace.”47
Most (62 percent) adolescents who read blogs say that they only read blogs by people they
already know.48 That is evidence of Benkler’s “communities of interest on smallish scales.”
There is no reason to believe that teen bloggers are disappointed if only friends visit their
sites. After all, they can launch their blog in ﬁve minutes using a service like Blogger. The
investment is commensurate to the payoff.
I see promise in these user-friendly formats. However, we need examples in which they
advance educational or civic purposes. A made-from-scratch Web site or video requires many
skills (technical, creative, and organizational) and is thus highly educational. It is not yet
clear that MySpace can serve those functions. To be sure, students could create an elaborate
product, such as a video or a map, and post it on a social networking site as a means of
distribution. But would they be satisﬁed if only their friends visited?
Furthermore, can students learn to use a public voice and achieve civic purposes by interacting mostly with friends? Adolescent culture (at least in the United States) is strongly
segregated, not only by race, ethnicity, and class, but also by identity type. In an inﬂuential
study begun in 1985, Eccles and Barber asked students to identify themselves with one of the
characters in a then-recent Hollywood movie, The Breakfast Club. All but 5 percent readily
placed themselves in precisely one of the following categories: jock, princess, brain, criminal,
or basket case. Moreover, each type of student spent most of his or her time with others of
A Public Voice for Youth
the same self-ascribed category.49 Students’ identities at tenth grade were strongly predictive
of outcomes a decade later.50 Thus, if we leave students to self-associate, given the norms in
a modern American high school, they are likely to segregate into groups that reinforce social
stratiﬁcation and that cannot address broad or shared problems.
Optimists might predict that technologies built on network principles will overcome segregation and make it less important for youth to develop an effective public voice. Each
participant can communicate privately with friends who have similar backgrounds, interests, and social circumstances, yet inclusive networks will emerge to shape public opinion
and gain political inﬂuence. Possibly. But network structures are equally compatible with
balkanization and can segregate those who have political interests from those who do not
feel connected to the public sphere.51 It is difﬁcult to see how one social group can change
the opinions of another without using their voice to reach a large and diverse audience.
Howard Rheingold, in his contribution to this volume, provides thoughtful guidance for
educators—in schools, colleges, and after-school programs—who want to encourage youth
to develop an effective public voice. He recognizes that young people begin with interests
and concerns, but they do not naturally or automatically possess the motivations and skills
necessary to inﬂuence public opinion and institutions. He proposed exercises that would
develop their skills, making full and creative use of digital technologies.
I strongly endorse this guidance, but I worry that it may never directly beneﬁt the vast
majority of students. We know from a century’s experience with student newspapers and
school governments that they tend to draw an elite group of young people who begin with
comparatively strong civic skills and motivations, as well as superior academic records and
prospects. They enhance their own civic skills by exercising a public voice, but their work is
largely ignored by most of their fellow students. According to survey data, an average high
school newspaper beneﬁts those who produce it but has no effects on the student body as
a whole, because students are not sufﬁciently connected to the school community to care
about its news.52
In short, there are limits to any strategy that gives kids online opportunities without changing their lifeworlds. Factors such as segregation and stratiﬁcation are powerful determinants
of how people use technology. I do not believe that youth media can be fully satisfactory
until young people’s communities become more democratic. That is a very tall order, but I
suggest that technology does not provide an alternative to the hard task of reforming the
ofﬂine communities and institutions in which young people come of age.
Locally produced media matter more to people who belong to a community or a public, in
the sense that John Dewey meant: “Wherever there is conjoint activity whose consequences
are appreciated as good by all singular persons who take part in it, and where the realization
of the good is such as to effect an energetic desire and effort to sustain it in being just
because it is a good shared by all, there is in so far a community. The clear consciousness of
a communal life, in all its implications, constitutes the idea of democracy.”53
One potential community to which most adolescents belong is their school. But the standard American high school is too big and unfocused to support conjoint activity or consciousness of a communal life. It has no common normative framework. As Harry Brighouse
describes it,
It is a 2000-plus student institution, in which no individual knows every other individual; in which
many children never have any teacher for more than one year of instruction; in which the prevailing
values include pep rallies for sports and a slavishly conformist loyalty to school and neighbourhood.
Civic Life Online
These schools maintain a deafening silence about spiritual or anti-materialist values, take sides in the
Cola wars, and accept as a given the prevalence of brand names and teen-marketing.54
Most secondary schools allow enormous internal segregation, or even encourage it by allowing students to choose diverse academic tracks. Furthermore, school buildings are isolated
from the broader community—behind bars and metal detectors in the inner cities, or behind
great lawns and parking lots in the suburbs. Students are asked to make very consequential choices about academic programs, extracurricular activities, and peer groups without
much attention from adults, unless they receive good guidance at home. If there are forums
intended for deliberation in the whole student body, such as school newspapers, student
governments, cultural events, or Web sites, they attract only particular subcultures. There
is no common agenda or interest that can draw everyone—no “public” in the Deweyan
Dewey acknowledged that “in any social group whatever, even in a gang of thieves, we ﬁnd
some interest held in common, and we ﬁnd a certain amount of interaction and cooperative
intercourse with other groups. From these two traits we derive our standard. How numerous
and varied are the interests which are consciously shared? How full and free is the interplay
with other forms of association?”55 These criteria are relevant to school culture. Do students
feel that they have a great deal in common, beyond the bare obligation to enter the same
building every day? And do the various associations within the school overlap with one
another and connect with groups beyond the school walls?
If students do not have much in common and do not belong to overlapping groups, then
celebrity culture will attract most of their interest. Youth will not be interested in products
created by peers that address local issues. They will not even know most of their peers. It
is not only people who are concerned about civic engagement and digital media who now
believe that the standard American high school is poorly organized and must be turned
into more of a community. The low rate of high school completion—only two-thirds in
some studies—has caught the attention of powerful institutions. The Bill and Melinda T.
Gates Foundation, the National Governors Association, and other national organizations
are calling for smaller, themed institutions with more student participation in common
work. Thomas Toch wrote a manifesto for the small schools movement in which he argued
that most large high schools fail to “engender a strong sense of community.” Instead, they
“tend to be intensely impersonal places.” The results include “alienation and apathy among
students and teachers,” a pervasive anonymity that “saps students’ motivation to learn and
teachers’ motivation to teach.”56
The mean student population of American schools rose about ﬁvefold between 1940 and
1970, and high schools of two thousand or more became common.57 But the tide is turning.
“New York City is phasing out large high schools and planning for 200 new small schools
over the next ﬁve years. Chicago is planning 100. Los Angeles is converting 130 middle and
high school campuses to smaller units.”58 And so on across the country.
Early in the movement for high school reform , there was a lot of enthusiasm
for simply reducing the average number of students per building. Evidence of impact was not
especially compelling. The movement has shifted away from school size to other strategies.
Without necessarily decreasing the student–teacher ratio, it is possible to make each teacher
responsible for fewer students by assigning youth to clusters that stay together for several
years and that continue with the same teaching staff. Schools can be connected more closely
to external institutions such as universities, community colleges, museums, and major nonproﬁts (also, more controversially, to churches). Schools can adopt curricular themes so that
A Public Voice for Youth
everyone in the building has some common interest or frame of reference. (Examples of
schoolwide themes include the environment, the U.S. Constitution, Africa, and health care.)
Giving each school a curricular focus means that students and their families will exercise
more choice among schools but less choice within schools, which will become inclusive
communities. A common theme can be deliberated and contested, provoking meaningful
conversations in a public voice.
The movement for high school reform has momentum and exempliﬁes one way to address the audience problem. High schools happen to be physical, local venues. I think that
geographical communities remain important, because many of our interactions with one
another and with governments occur at the local level. If our immediate geographical settings fail to be communities—as is the case in most high schools—then we lose our ability to
engage in some important ways. As Friedland concludes, “place, the environment of action,
not technology, is the critical element in civic and democratic participation.”59 However,
high school reform is an example of the broader claim that adolescents need communities
and associations. Some valuable ties may be dispersed and virtual, not local and face-to-face.
Conclusion
Community-based, nonproﬁt youth media groups have developed an impressive body of
experience and knowledge. The next step is to increase the scale of media work dramatically,
which means offering more and better courses in schools. Given current policies, that will
take rigorous experimental or quasi-experimental studies that show the impact of youth
media work on outcomes that major institutions care about—not so much civic engagement
as high school completion and preparation for college.
Meanwhile, as youth media work becomes more common in schools, it will be important to
ﬁnd responsive, engaged audiences for students’ products. Deliberately marketing students’
work and using new user-friendly formats (such as social-networking software) may help. But
ultimately, schools will have to be restructured so that they function more like communities
before youth media work is fully satisfying.
As a ﬁrst step, it would be useful to study the ecology of youth media within different kinds
of schools. Does a higher proportion of the student body seek youth-produced media in
schools that are small and focused (as I hypothesize), or does school size make no difference?
What are the effects of having a diverse or a homogeneous student population on media
consumption? What are the apparent effects of academic tracking on students’ interest in
one another’s work? Do digital media become means of connecting various peer groups and
subcultures within schools, or do they reinforce divisions?

Civic Identities, Online Technologies: From Designing Civics Curriculum
to Supporting Civic Experiences
Marina Umaschi Bers
Tufts University, Department of Child Development
Peter is a twelve-year-old boy. He connects to Zora, a virtual city built and inhabited by eleven- to ﬁfteen-yearolds. His avatar has his own face. Peter is happy because he feels that the virtual home he created in Zora is
almost ﬁnished. He put pictures of his favorite things and people, and wrote stories about his family and friends.
Peter decides to go around the virtual city. He quickly navigates through Zora’s different public spaces: the Baptist
Church, the French Chateaux, the Sports Arena and the Jewish temple. Upon entering the Jewish temple a virtual
rabbi welcomes him with a blessing. "This is clever!" thinks Peter, "I will program my soccer player to welcome
visitors to the Sports arena.” The temple is populated by Jewish symbols and characters created by other Jewish
kids. At ﬁrst sight, there is a map of Israel, Hebrew letters, and a picture of a man praying. Peter navigates
around the three-dimensional space and encounters many different objects. Peter decides to add a television to
the temple. Inside it, he puts a snapshot from the movie Schindler’s List that he found in the Web. He associates
the value "documentation" to the television and deﬁnes it in the Zora Collaborative Values Dictionary as "it is
very important to remember history. That way, bad things won’t happen again. Holocaust survivors are getting
very old now, and if someone doesn’t record their stories of what happened, we are doomed to forget and repeat
the horrors."
As he is about to leave the temple, he ﬁnds a case placed by Elena earlier that week. It has a Web link to
a news article about a shooting in a Jewish community center. Peter clicks on the case and learns more about
what happened. He also sees that Elena has used the Zora values dictionary to create a new value, "tolerance,”
and link it to the case. As Peter is reading Elena’s deﬁnition of tolerance, the Zora mayor invites him to join a
meeting in the virtual city hall.
This scenario describes an actual engagement by young people participating in a virtual
summer camp with a three-dimensional multiuser environment called Zora.1 Zora provides
easy-to-use tools for children to design and program their own virtual city and, in the process,
learn new concepts and ways of thinking about identity and civic life. Children are put in
the role of producers, instead of consumers, of information, knowledge, and habits of mind.
The notion of youth as active cultural producers is a theme shared by most chapters in this
I am grateful to the following organizations that funded different aspects of the work presented in
this chapter: Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service at Tufts University, Academic Technologies
at Tufts University, and NSF (NSF Career award “Communities of Learning and Care: Multi-user Virtual
Environments That Promote Positive Youth Development,” NSF IIS-0447166). The author is also thankful
to members of the DevTech research group at Tufts University, in particular Clement Chau, Ashima
Mathur, Daniela Mesalles, and Keiko Satoh, for their work on ACT. Finally, I’d like to thank Lance
Bennett, the editor of this volume, for his constructive suggestions for improving this chapter, and the
other contributors to this book for the wonderful exchanges and conversations we’ve had.

volume. In Zora, this takes a different meaning because the environment provides a safe
“social laboratory”2 for youth to experiment with some of the skills and attitudes needed
to become good citizens. Zora is an example of a type of computational tool called identity
construction environments (ICEs).3 ICEs are developed in the spirit of the constructionist
philosophy of learning, which asserts that children learn better by doing creative things with
computers. Thus software and hardware should provide authoring tools to enable children
to make, design, and create digital artifacts while participating in a community of peers. Zora
provides tools for youth to explore self and community by encountering the challenges of
democratic participation.4
As shown in the short excerpt above, Zora engages children in thinking about issues of
identity by inviting them to construct their own virtual homes and populate them with their
most cherished objects, characters, pictures, stories, and personal and moral values. The city
metaphor invites children to explore their civic identities by building the city’s public spaces
and by participating in a forum for discussing civic issues, as it will be later shown. Zora
allows youth to participate in the virtual community not only by engaging in discussions
and arguments, but also by designing and making new objects and new places within the
virtual city, as a response to the virtual world’s civic needs. ICEs, such as Zora, engage
youth in chatting as well as doing, discussing as well as creating, and thinking as well as
producing.
This chapter ﬁrst provides a rationale for the need of developing educational programs for
promoting youth civic engagement that make use of new technologies. Then, it presents a
typology to guide the design of Internet-based interventions, taking into account both the
affordances of the technology and the educational approach to the use of the technology.
To illustrate this typology, examples of technology-based civic educational programs are
presented. Later, it brieﬂy presents the design of the Zora virtual environment, highlighting the features that support civic learning, and two different case studies in which Zora
was used. It concludes with future directions for how to develop and use on-line virtual
environments to promote civic engagement experiences that might transfer to the off-line
world; and with reﬂections on how to make the contributions of this chapter “timeless,”
as lessons can be useful regardless of the technology in vogue in a particular time and
The typology of different interventions and the case studies illustrate what is possible in
terms of civic education when providing young people with technological and media literacy
skills as well as civic habits of mind in the context of an immersive virtual intervention. The
notion of media literacy is further explored in Rheingold’s and Levine’s chapters. Raynes-
Goldie and Walker’s chapter provide another example based on their extensive work done
with the Web site TakingITGlobal.
Virtual Environments: New Opportunities for Civic Engagement
Today’s youth are often criticized for their lack of civic participation and involvement in
political life. Technology has been blamed, among many other causes, for fostering social isolation and youth’s retreat into a private world disconnected from their “real life”
communities.5 However, current research is beginning to indicate that today’s youth are
indeed engaged in civic life, but in ways very different from previous generations. First,
youth tend to choose activism, volunteerism, and community work, as opposed to wellestablished means such as voting in elections or participating in political parties, as has been

stated in different ways by Coleman, Earl and Schussman, Montgomery, and Raynes-Goldie
and Walker in this volume. Second, technology—speciﬁcally the Internet—has provided a
new way for youth to create communities that extend beyond geographic boundaries. These
virtual communities enable youth to engage in civic and volunteering activities across local communities and national frontiers, to learn about political life, and to experience the
challenges of democratic participation.6
However, although there is a growing body of research indicating the educational and social potential of the Internet,7 there have been few studies conducted to purposefully evaluate
technology-based interventions in the area of civic engagement. Since virtual environments
can provide quick access to a wide range of information and resources, communication
mechanisms for engaging in critical debates,8 and tools for supporting collaboration and for
enabling new expressions of social life,9 they can serve as powerful platforms for developing
educational programs to promote civic education. In a test-driven educational atmosphere
in which most public schools might not be able to devote resources and time to increase student’s civic participation, the potential of new technologies is even greater for reaching those
same students when they are outside of school and connecting to the Internet from their
homes. Virtual communities, simulations, or interactive games speciﬁcally designed with
civic education goals might offer a space for young people to become civically engaged—at
least in the on-line world.
Although preliminary studies have shown the potential of new technologies to engage
young people in on-line civic life, there is a need of more research looking at how technologybased interventions particularly aimed at fostering civic engagement can promote participation not only in the virtual world, but also in the face-to-face world.
While participation in virtual life does not replace traditional civic actions, research shows
that adults are more likely to vote and be engaged in the civic sphere if, as youth, they were
involved in community-based organizations or extracurricular activities.10 As the Internet is
becoming a new way for youth to form community-based organizations and to spend a big
portion of their after-school time, it is plausible that future research will show that youth
who are more active on-line will also grow into more engaged citizens.
For example, pilot work by Chau suggests that college students who possess high level
of interpersonal technological abilities (i.e., who use technology to establish connections with
others) may use the Internet in manners that are more conducive to building connecting
and caring relationships with peers than would students with lower level of interpersonal technological abilities. Thus, youth who are low on internal technological efﬁcacy may beneﬁt most
if provided ﬁrst with educational opportunities to develop technological competence and
a sense of conﬁdence in their technological skills.11 This early work indicates that it is important to understand and evaluate youth’s technological competencies, before developing
speciﬁc technology-rich educational interventions.
While technological competence is a prerequisite for youth to fully beneﬁt from these
programs, if the end-goal is to promote civic engagement, it is imperative to understand
our philosophical and pedagogical stance regarding civic education. Do we want to use
technology to design interventions that will help youth to develop civic skills, such as
deliberation and decision making? Do we want to expose youth to opportunities that allow
them to actively participate in community life through the use of technology? Or is our goal
to provide technological environments in which youth can develop civic identities grounded
on personal and moral values such as social justice? These different options are not mutually
exclusive, and the best interventions integrate all of them.

From Civic Skills to Civic Identities
Once in the Zora City Hall, Peter joins a conversation about the case placed by Elena with a Web
link to a news article about a shooting in a Jewish community center.
Elena says:
It was very scary. I read the article and one of the things the man who committed
this act said is that he wanted to remind people that all Jews should be killed. That sent serious
shivers down my spine.
Kosho says:
Nazis. A leader tells them that others are the cause of all their problems.
Peter says:
Some people are just looking for someone to blame.
Janet says:
People are gonna feel the way they want to feel and no one can really change
their minds
Elena says:
They are entitled to their opinions but it’s their actions that need to be stopped.
Janet, do you really think that? No one can change their minds? And if it’s true that we can’t
change their minds, should we do something to limit their actions?
Peter says:
There isn’t anything we can do.
Nino says:
This guy should be dragged out and ﬂayed alive.
Kosho says:
You just can’t ﬁx a wrong with a wrong.
Janet says:
Yeah, violence is never the answer.
Nino says:
If anybody deserves the death penalty, he does.
Peter says:
But I think no one deserves the death penalty.
Carla says:
He should just have life in jail.
Sheila says:
He shouldn’t be shot but helped, I really don’t know how, but he just needs a
way to get familiar with other cultures.
Nino says:
That’s not going to help. Death penalty.
Peter says:
We don’t have the authority to take a person’s life. Death penalty is still not
Sheila says:
I think by killing him we show that we have given up and the only way to
solve things is to kill somebody, and I know that is not right.
Matrix says:
I read an editorial that said people should just be put in jail for life because,
believe it or not, the death penalty cost more than letting him live for the rest of his life
(30 yrs.).
Elena says:
Answer my questions, should anyone who kills be killed? Or does intent matter?
And if intent matters, does it matter more or less than the result of the action?
Nino says:
Intent and result both matter.
Elena says:
And once he is killed, assuming he is, what would be the repercussions of that?
Would his family go after the government? Would he become a neo-Nazi martyr?
Janet says:
Maybe there should be a boot camp for people like this.
Peter says:
It wouldn’t really work. The only prevention is at home. People need to be
brought up knowing discrimination is wrong.
Civic Identities, Online Technologies
Sheila says:
I think we can’t do that much for adults, but the kids in school I know we can
do a lot, so I think we should try to concentrate on making sure they know that this stuff is
While this on-line conversation continues, Ernie, one of the youngest and shyest children using
Zora, who is very quiet “listening” but is too shy to participate, starts to make a new virtual place, the
"Everyone’s Temple,” which he describes as a space for “all the cultures and religions to get along.”
This example of the type of exchanges that happen in Zora points us in two different directions that this chapter follows.12 First, the design considerations, both from a pedagogical
and a technical perspective, that need to be taken into account when designing virtual environments that, beyond providing civic knowledge and information, afford opportunities for
learners to engage in civic discourse and civic action. Second, the civic education approach
used when developing these technologically rich interventions. On one side of the spectrum, civic education can take a behaviorist approach (i.e., providing skills and knowledge
that might be useful for both living in a civil way and contributing to civil society). On the
other side, it can take a psychological approach (i.e., focusing on helping children to develop
civic identities by exploring personal and moral values deeply rooted in their own sociocultural and religious backgrounds). It is important to understand where in the spectrum we
situate our educational programs so as to choose the best possible use of technology and the
design features of the software.
The ﬁrst question regarding pedagogical and technical considerations is addressed in the
section “Educational Technologies and Civic Education,” which looks at the different ways in
which technology can be used to teach and to promote learning. A typology and examples are
presented. The second question regarding approaches to technology-based civic education
programs is addressed by presenting case studies of how a particular kind of technology,
the Zora identity construction environment, was developed to integrate and combine both
behaviorist and psychological approaches.
The goal of helping children to clarify their values as a ﬁrst step toward civic engagement is
not new in education, neither is it associated with the use of technology. However, new technologies such as multiuser virtual environments have the potential to amplify the experience
by situating personal values in the context of a living community. When Lawrence Kohlberg,
the well-known academic of moral reasoning, proposed the “just community” model as a
safe educational space critical in shaping an individual’s moral development,13 he realized
the importance of a community for advancing moral thinking and moral behaviors. Thus, as
opposed to his most well-known work on moral reasoning (which focused, in the Piagetian
tradition, on asking children to solve isolated moral dilemmas and assigning them to a particular moral reasoning stage), Kohlberg realized that a moral community was needed to breed
moral individuals. In Kohlberg’s “just community” program, students and teachers engaged
in conversations about dilemmas and controversial issues similar to the ones described in
Zora. However, members of these just communities could make decisions about all aspects
of the community life, except curriculum decisions. This is a very important difference with
the type of educational work that happens in virtual communities such as Zora.
There are three major differences between the just community educational approach and
the experiences afforded by participating in Zora. Some of these differences are due to the
choice of media (virtual environments vs. face to face) and others to the pedagogical stance.
First, as shown by the examples presented earlier, community members do not follow an
already-established curriculum specifying the activities they should engage in. They are
Civic Life Online
empowered to decide what kind of projects and discussions they would work on. Thus, they
engage in what Hart describes as one of the highest levels in the ladder of civic participation observed in children, child initiated and directed projects.14 Second, Zora makes it easy
for learners to observe the connections between what is said in the on-line conversations
(i.e., discussion about discrimination) and what is done in the virtual city (i.e., creating the
“Everyone’s Temple”). An environment that offers the possibility of observing the relationship between saying and doing is powerful because in issues of identity and values, community
and civics, concrete actions matter as much as analytical thinking.15 In the real world, however, taking action would involve a long-term complex process for young children. Third,
in Kohlberg’s work, the tools people have to build a just community are words and their
derivates such as meetings, sharing stories, discussing dilemmas, etc. In Zora, as shown by
Eric’s “Everyone’s Temple,” people can also engage in making concrete artifacts, such as
virtual places, that can be used and inhabited.
Regardless of these major differences, Zora and the just community model share a similar
educational purpose: the development of an educational approach to engage children in
developing a community with the goal of learning about moral values, explore the civic
aspects of the self and exercise civic skills by making decisions about community life. In the
process, civic identities are developed and public voices, as discussed in Rheingold’s chapter,
start to emerge.
Educational Technologies and Civic Education
Kohlberg’s just community is one of many civic education programs. I use it in this chapter
as an example of what has been called praxis-based educational models. These are developed
to give people the experiences through which they can become effective citizens.16 Praxisbased models are in sharp contrast with knowledge-based models focused on what people
should know and understand about citizenship.
These distinct approaches propose different pedagogies concerned with how best to support learning, and different epistemologies, concerned with the question of what is considered learning. While knowledge-based models pay attention to the teaching curriculum,
praxis-based models are concerned with how young people can be given opportunities for
engagement and decision making in their communities. The challenge is how to reconcile
these models in the test-driven and politically conﬁned environment of most public schools.
The distinction between knowledge and praxis permeates the world of education and is
consistent with two different approaches for developing educational technologies, identi-
ﬁed by Seymour Papert, pioneer in the ﬁeld, as instructionist and constructionist. While the
instructionist approach sees the effectiveness of a technology as situated in its instructional
efﬁcacy, and therefore its potential for transmitting knowledge and information, the constructionist approach conceives the computer as a tool to help learners have experiences that
will support their own construction of knowledge.
Within the instructionist way of using technology for education, which is closely aligned
with the knowledge-based model proposed in civic education mentioned earlier, two major
paradigms have emerged: computer-assisted instruction (CAI) and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS).17 While most of the educational technologies designed with the CAI paradigm
serve as a new medium for the presentation and delivery of information to students in the
form of drill and practice, the ITS paradigm aims at creating educational software that adapts
itself to the user. Unlike static CAI applications, ITS educational software incorporates an
Civic Identities, Online Technologies
interactive component, with each student receiving a different type of instruction based on
skill level and ability.
While instructionism—and its two paradigms, CAI and ITS—focuses on the role of technology to do better teaching by providing better ways of transmitting information, constructionism asserts that computers are powerful educational technologies when used as tools for
supporting the design, the construction, and the programming of personally and epistemologically meaningful projects that engage learners in new experiences. Constructionism is
rooted in Piaget’s constructivism, in which learning is best characterized as an individual
cognitive process given a social and cultural context. However, whereas Piaget’s theory was
developed to explain how knowledge is constructed in our heads, constructionism, developed by Papert, pays particular attention to the role of constructions in the world as a support
for those in the head. Thus, constructionism is both a theory of learning and a strategy for
education. It offers the framework for developing a technology-rich design-based learning
environment, in which learning happens best when learners are engaged in learning by
making, creating, programming, and communicating.
Constructionism also has two major paradigms: the Logo-inspired programming languages
for children, and the computer-supported collaborative learning movement. Constructionism views the programming of a computer as a powerful way to gain new insights into how
the mind works and learns. Thus, it advocates for providing children with an opportunity
to become computer programmers as a way to learn about different content areas (in particular mathematics and science) but, more important, to learn about learning. Papert argued
that using a child-friendly version of the programming language LISP, called Logo or the
language of the turtle, was an easy and natural way to engage students in programming.
Logo allows students to actively create artifacts in a process of discovery-based learning—a
process directly aligned with the praxis-based model of experiential learning. By now there
is a long-standing constructionist tradition of authoring tools and programming environments that follow the Logo steps. Some of these technological environments are designed
for children’s learning about mathematics and science,18 for creating virtual communities
to foster peer learning and collaboration and for designing computational environments to
promote positive youth development through storytelling.19
The other paradigm within constructionism is computer-supported collaborative learning.
This most recently developed paradigm shifts the process of cognition as residing within the
head of one individual to the view that cognition is situated within a particular community
of learning or practice.20 Therefore, educational technologies designed within this paradigm
take seriously the need to provide tools for community building and community scaffolding
of learning. Thus the focus is on creating social environments in which constructionist types
of learning activities using technologies can happen. This pedagogical switch from learning
as an individual experience, which was rooted in Piaget’s theories, to learning as a social
process, which is rooted in Vygostsky’s theory, occurred concurrently with the fast-growing
uses of the Internet in education and the development of virtual learning communities.
Aligning instructionist technologies with knowledge-based approaches to civic education,
and constructionism to praxis-based approaches, provides a framework for thinking about
the different ways in which new technologies, in particular the Internet, can be used for developing civic education programs and for distinguishing the pedagogical and technological
affordances of the different approaches (see Figure 1). Both approaches can take a behaviorist
or a psychological stance, or a combination of both, depending on the choice of primary
learning outcomes, civic skills or civic identities.

A typology for integrating approaches to civic education and educational technologies.
Figure 1 shows a typology emerging from intersecting civic education approaches with
educational technologies approaches. By analyzing technology-based civic education programs, six distinct categories emerged in the typology. The ﬁrst three categories refer to
programs that provide opportunities for youth to access and create on-line content, as well
as encounter on-line guidelines for practice. The other three refer to programs that provide
learners with opportunities to immerse themselves in the civic realm by playing interactive
games, participating in simulations, or developing constructionist communities.
Table 1 provides examples of technology-rich civic education programs within each typology. For a different kind of typology that looks at the content of the Web sites, regardless
of the affordances of the technology regarding a particular stance toward civic education,
refer to the March 2004 report “Youth as E-Citizens: Engaging the Digital Generation” by
Montgomery et al.21
In the next sections I will present work done with Zora, an example of a constructionist
virtual community, as a way to elucidate what represents for me the full potential of using
technology to develop praxis-based programs that integrate behaviorist and psychological
approaches to civic education.
However, although praxis-based programs are at the heart of what I consider powerful
educational experiences using technology, this view is not always in agreement with
current trends in the American educational system that tend to focus on knowledge-based
programs in which students can be assessed using traditional means such as comprehensive
multichoice exams.
The typology and the continuum of instructionist to constructionist approaches need to
be problematized. For example, one of the reasons that programs such as Student Voices fall

For example, if used in the context of public schools, the Zora curriculum can be strengthen
thus taking the experience into a more knowledge-based model.
Zora: Developing Civic Identities
Zora is an example of a constructionist virtual community speciﬁcally designed to promote positive youth development. Positive youth development involves cognitive, personal,
Civic Identities, Online Technologies
social, emotional, and civic aspects of adolescence, which researchers refer to as the six C’s:
competence (cognitive abilities and behavioral skills for being healthy), connection (positive
bonds with people and institutions), character (integrity and moral centeredness), conﬁdence
(positive self-regard, a sense of self-efﬁcacy), caring (human values empathy and a sense of
social justice), and contribution (orientation to contribute to civil society).23 Together, these
characteristics reﬂect a growing consensus about what is involved in healthy and positive
development among people in the ﬁrst two decades of their lives.
Within this framework, the sixth C, contribution to civic life, plays an important role
because it is a predictor of the positive direction toward which an individual is moving in
his or her developmental trajectory. Zora has design features that promote each of the C’s
by providing tools for users to create and inhabit a virtual city and, in the process, learn new
things about identity and civic life.
Zora’s design and infrastructure provides a bridge between what I have called earlier behaviorist approaches to civic education, focused on helping children become better citizens
by teaching them civic attitudes and skills such as respectful argumentation, debate, information literacy, and so on, and psychological approaches focused on internal motivation
to support the development of morally responsible individuals who will shape a morally
responsible and civically minded society. These can help children to discover their personal
and moral values as inspirations and compasses for developing a civic self concerned with
issues of equality, morality, and social justice.
In Zora, behavioral and psychological approaches are integrated by providing computational tools for children to create a virtual city with private and public spaces. They can
navigate the three-dimensional space with their avatar of choice and chat in real-time. For
example, each user creates his or her personal home and populates it with objects and characters. For each of them, children create a story to describe it and assign a value and its
corresponding deﬁnition to indicate why the creation is personally meaningful and what
moral message the object/character carries. For example, as shown in the example presented
earlier, Elena had created a TV with the movie Schindler’s List and had assigned and deﬁned
the value “documentation.” All of the individual values and deﬁnitions created by children
are updated into the Zora’s collaborative values dictionary, which serves at least two different
functions. First, it provides a way to understand the “moral climate” of the virtual city. Second, it engages Zora users in different activities to decide which of those values they want to
keep as ﬂagship for their city, which ones need some discussion because there is disagreement
about their meaning (i.e., different users have entered a same value but deﬁne it in different
ways), and which others will serve as the basis for developing the city’s constitution, mission
statement, and code of conduct.
As mentioned above, Zora’s design supports both behaviorist and psychological approaches to civic education. In terms of promoting behavior changes, the most salient design
features are “cases.” A case is an object with a particular kind of shape and graphical image
representing an event or a circumstance to be discussed and agreed upon by all community
members. In the same spirit as a legal case, a Zora case requires community members to
engage in debate and take action to resolve conﬂicts. This kind of participation in a learning
environment might serve as a model for the larger political community in which children
will participate as adults. Users can create new cases as new issues arise.
For example, in the scenario presented before, Elena had put a case with a link to a news
article about an anti-Semitic incident. The fact that it was a “case,” and not only an object,
indicated to the Zora citizens that Elena wanted to have a discussion about it and prompted
Civic Life Online
the Zora city mayor to call for a meeting in the City Hall. Once there, the exchange evolved
from discussing anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia to debating about the fairness and
usefulness of the death penalty, as well as preventive mechanisms for educating young people
against hate crimes. While this case was about a current event reported in the newspaper, and
thus engaged children in thinking about the impact on society at large, other cases are only
relevant to Zora, such as those dealing with setting up the social organization of the virtual
city, such as “I think that people should not change or put things in other peoples [sic] rooms.
Unless they have permission,” or “Anyone should be able to drop anything anywhere, but
with a consequence. This should be like breaking a law, punishable by imprisonment of one
Zora’s design features that support a behaviorist approach, such as cases, are grounded on
understanding civic education as a deliberative and argumentative process that helps children take on civic behaviors. Thus, the children’s experience in Zora should serve them as a
playground for experimenting with the ways of thinking and behaving needed to function
in a community, in particular with the complexities involved in self-organization, government, and decision making, This is consistent with extensive research that suggests that
the involvement in participatory democracy, social institutions, group decision making, and
self-government are critical in shaping individuals’ moral development.
Moral development is an important aspect of what I have called the psychological approach
to civic education. Some of Zora’s design features are developed with this in mind. For
example, the collaborative values dictionary, which was described earlier, helps children to
develop a sense of identity by asking them to think about their most cherished personal and
moral values and how they have inﬂuenced their creations in the world. There is another
type of object, called heroes and villains, which have special attributes and serve as models of
identiﬁcation and counteridentiﬁcation. As the American psychologist Erik Erikson points
out, “no ego can develop outside of social processes that offer workable prototypes and
roles.”24 Thus, creating Zora’s heroes and villains provides a way for children to engage in
the dynamic process of identifying with and differentiating from others, which is essential to
form a coherent sense of self. The values dictionary and the heroes and villains are the most
notorious Zora’s features explicitly designed to support building civic identities which are
morally grounded and that invite children to explore, understand, and reﬂect about personal
and moral values.
While some of these design elements are unique to Zora, they are also present in many
of the technologies and tools mentioned in the typology of educational technologies for
civic engagement presented earlier. For example, different forms of media production focused on civic engagement, such as the weblogs and the wikis presented by Levine’s and
Rheingold’s articles and the on-line petitions described in Earl and Schussman’s chapter can
provide mechanisms for promoting collaboration, including comprehensive Web sites such
as TakingITGlobal, described in Raynes-Goldie and Luke’s article, which can offer opportunities for taking global civic action.
In the next section I describe an educational program, Active Citizenship through Technology (ACT), developed using the Zora environment, to help precollege students to develop
civic identities, while forming a community of peers and social support network.
Using Zora to Create the Virtual Campus of the Future

This is a log excerpt from a real-time conversation in Zora by a group of Tufts University incoming freshmen who participated in the optional preorientation program, ACT, developed
by Bers.25
ACT is both an educational and a research program. Students come together for three days
to use Zora to create and inhabit a virtual campus of the future. At the end of the intensive
program, they make a short digital video, or infomercial, about their virtual campus. During
their ﬁrst semester in college, students came together again in an open house to show their
infomercials to the campus community. During their four years in college, ACT participants
are asked to complete surveys and participate in focus groups in an effort to collect data
regarding the impact of ACT in their academic and extracurricular experiences.
The ACT curriculum is designed so students, in the process of developing their campus
of the future, can ﬁrst learn about the real campus by interviewing faculty, students, and
administrators and then discuss how they could improve its facilities, its policies and curricular offerings and, most important, what is the relationship between their campus and their
surrounding community and what are student’s civic privileges and responsibilities toward
the local neighborhoods and international communities.
In the spirit of a constructionist community, the goal of ACT is to immerse youth in a hightech playground where they can acquire civic knowledge and skills as well as experiment
with civic behaviors and democratic participation. These will be useful not only for growing
as committed citizens, but also for adjusting to their new community, the university campus.
During the ﬁrst two years of running the ACT program, while most of the discussions in
Zora were about building a stronger community within the campus, some started to explore
how to build relationships between the campus and the surrounding neighborhoods. These
discussions were supported by the creation of virtual exhibits displaying issues of concern in
the Zora campus of the future.
The ACT intensive program, which takes place at the end of the summer just before
participants’ matriculation to the university, has several goals. First, to engage incoming
freshmen in a fun activity that leverages on their interest on interactive games and virtual
communities. Second, to help them to connect with each other and to ﬁnd a social support
network early on, before the stress of the academic year begins. Third, to promote civic
engagement both at the campus and the community level.26
Some conceive civic engagement as being a good neighbor, obeying rules, and participating in the community; others think of it as engagement with political processes such as
voting. In the work presented with Zora, the notion of civic engagement goes beyond a focus
solely on the procedural aspects of democracy to one that embraces the many facets of a deliberative democracy in one’s own environment, school, local community, or larger society.
This includes the ability to engage in civic conversations, to develop civic knowledge, skills,
Civic Life Online
attitudes and behaviors, and to participate in community service, activism, and advocacy.
Since the ACT program is conducted with freshmen, civic engagement is primarily deﬁned
as all of the above in the context of college and campus community.
As mentioned before, ACT is part of an ongoing multiyear longitudinal pilot study in which
two cohorts of students participate in the preorientation program using Zora and are followed
through their academic career by collecting participant data via multiple means. First, the
Zora environment readily provides a log of all online activities and conversations that happen
throughout the program. Log ﬁles from the program are read and coded by orientation peer
leaders and researchers. Second, exit focus group interviews and surveys to collect overall
feedback about the program as well as suggestions for improvement of individual sessions
and activities is requested from participants. Third, once a year, participants complete followup surveys, which are used to assess the carry-over effect of the program on participants’
active involvement on campus and in the surrounding community. Data from a randomized
control group (i.e., a randomized group of other students on campus of the same cohort who
did not participate in ACT) are collected each year as comparisons. To date, two cohorts of
students have participated in ACT. The ﬁrst consisting of eighteen students, the second of
twenty-one. Participants in the ﬁrst cohort came back to the second group as peer leaders.
The ﬁrst cohort of ACT participants chose to use Zora to develop a virtual campus very
focused on student’s own interests and needs. For example, they built the “Campus Safety
Center,” which offers “a shuttle service for 18 hours a day followed by a campus cab system
that goes anywhere in a 5 mile radius of the campus, and the ‘Jumbo Appetite,’ a dining hall
where themed meals are served and a suggestion box where requests for particular foods can

Hall, the Winifred Mandela Library, and so on. After on-line brainstorming about some basic
houses that were needed, students began working alone. For example, one student created
a computer room for the campus as he is planning on being a computer science major. He
described it as follows: “The computer spot is a computer lab where all activity is subject to
surveillance in order to protect against illegal actions. There is also a university Cellphone
Network. The university will provide each student with a free cell phone and will have its
own network, where all students and faculty can call each other for free.”
As individual locations started to appear, and not everyone agreed on the purpose and
facilities offered, the group decided they needed to come together and ﬁnalize a plan to
complete their campus instead of working separately without discussing what they are doing. They discussed several cases as a group and divided up tasks. Students assigned each
other rooms to create, and deadlines for completion were agreed upon. The group decided
that the content presented in each house was more important than its aesthetic appearance; therefore, they focused on developing well-written descriptions, stories, and values
associated with objects. For example, they chose the following values in their collaborative
values dictionary as the most important to guide behaviors in their virtual campus: Academic Curiosity, Cooperation, Tolerance, Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Leadership, and
The beginning of self-organization and self-governance started to appear on the second
day of the program. They discussed issues such as student life, policies/rules for graduation,
Internet, administration, and student services. Following is an excerpt of a conversation in
which students discussed funding for students’ clubs.
Peter says:
Are we going to have fun student clubs? Do clubs have to give back to the
community?
Melanie says:
If you are giving back to the community, should you get more money?
Alan says:
Should we fund the clubs?
Peter says:
Every year, they give their proposal. . . then they decide. . . and get their permission.
David says:
If you are giving back to the community, you should get money. Why put
money into clubs ?
Peter says:
If it lasts then that is good; but if you are new, you start-off with the minimum
As shown in this excerpt, most of the on-line discussions focused on internal issues to
campus life. Civic engagement was conceived as a process of becoming involved with the
civic life of campus, such as assigning internal budgets or developing policies that would be
best for students. While this was one of the goals of the ACT program, in this ﬁrst experience,
students did not explore the relationship between campus and community. Data from focus
groups showed that since students were just entering into a new community (the college
campus) they ﬁrst needed to understand and master it, and then venture out of the hills of
the university. As the ACT curriculum was focused on giving students the freedom to pursue
their own interest in an effort to give them ownership over their virtual campus, the lack of
connection between college civic life with the broader community is not surprising.
Civic Life Online
A virtual exhibit about the importance of art education programs in schools.
Based on this ﬁnding, the next year, the second cohort of ACT participants was exposed to
a curriculum that focused on developing a civically engaged virtual campus with strong connections with the surrounding community. For example, students were asked to investigate
the living conditions and the educational and health situation of the campus neighborhoods
and propose recommendations of how their future virtual campus could have an impact on
For example, some students chose to focus on the relationship between the local town
police and the university police. They conducted research to analyze if and how both groups
interact and they interviewed police ofﬁcials to understand better if and how the surrounding community beneﬁts from the campus police. Other students chose to focus on the role
of the universities, in particular the education, child development, and psychology departments, to provide child care and educational opportunities for members of the surrounding
community.
Some students chose to do research about issues of public interest such as the impact
of comprehensive exams in the learning environment and state-mandated curriculum, and
the positive impact that athletics programs and art education programs can have on a local
community (see Figure 3). Instead of writing their ideas and results of their research in a
paper or action plan, they used Zora to develop a virtual exhibit to teach others about their
ﬁndings. The interactive nature of Zora allowed participants to use the tool for both the
process and the product, as well as to invite contributions from other ACT participants who
did not choose to work on these issues.
In the ACT experience described above, two cohorts of incoming freshman used Zora to
design and inhabit a virtual campus of the future. As one of the participants in the ﬁrst group
said, “I did not really learn much about civic engagement . . . well . . . actually if I wanted to
become a senator ACT would have been very useful.”
Civic Identities, Online Technologies
This student realized that through his experience in ACT he started to gain the skills
needed to participate in public life, such as making decisions that might have a broad impact
and engaging in thoughtful debate and argumentation. But most important, he started to
develop a civic identity that prompted him to look beyond his own interests and to take into
consideration the public’s best interest.
However, this student did not understand that, although the skills he learned in ACT are
useful for becoming a senator and participating in the civic life of the country as a leader,
they are also useful to becoming a positive contributor to civic society from many other
roles. Even more important, while ACT might have been useful to this particular student,
skills and identities do not develop in three days, but over time. Research has shown that
engaging young children in civic activities from an early age is a positive predictor of their
participation in later civic life. This explains the effort to work with young children, as I did
in the context of a summer program for children aged eleven to sixteen who used Zora to
develop their virtual city, from which excerpts of the scenario presented at the beginning of
the paper were taken.27
Future Directions: From Online to Ofﬂine Experiences
Zora is one of the many tools available today to provide children with experiences that will
help them develop civic skills and attitudes as well as build their civic identities by helping
them ﬁnd a moral compass that will lead them to civic action. As technology rapidly changes,
new tools will be developed and new possibilities for developing civic education programs
will emerge. Thus, the question is what will not change even when everything else changes?
People, and our inclination to learn by doing, rather than by being told, won’t change. A
short answer to this complex question is the need to focus on technologies that allow young
people to experiment with “what if” situations, by making, creating, developing, discussing,
debating. In the continuum of instructionist to constructionist approaches to civic education
programs using technology presented in the earlier typology, I suggest that the focus on
constructionist types of experiences should remain. Even when there is a strong push toward
knowledge-base approaches that are best suited to test-driven curriculum. The advantage of
constructionist and praxis-based models is that they are open-ended. For example, in Zora,
teachers can create their own public virtual spaces to directly educate students about civic
facts and process. But they can also design an experience in which students will take the
Open-ended technologies allow different kinds of learners to use them in the way it suits
them best. For example, some might choose to display content (as the ACT participants did
in their virtual exhibits), others to engage in storytelling (as those who used Zora to write
stories or values deﬁnitions), while others might choose to engage in debates (as those who
discussed cases), or to use technology to create or program artifacts as alter egos that represent
their point of view through a graphical interactive object (such as the little boy who created
the “Everyone’s Temple”).
Technological tools also need to be open ended to enable different kinds of teachers or
after-school coordinators to best integrate them with their own teaching style, curriculum,
and state and federal mandates. For example, some teachers might choose to design an
experience with unstructured activities, such as the case of the summer camp with young
children, while others might like to develop a more structured curriculum, as it was done
in ACT. For example, one of the activities was designed to help students evaluate if the
Civic Life Online
campus they designed could handle a real-life, controversial community-related issue (e.g.,
bias incident, cheating). Actual news articles from a college’s student newspaper were posted
in Zora for students to read and discuss. After discussing the articles, students were asked to
present their responses and thoughts somewhere in their virtual campus (e.g., the campus
center). In addition, students could go back to their virtual campus and make changes, such
as revising or adding services, classes, committees, or resources. Teachers have different styles
and curricular needs. Thus the technology needs to be ﬂexible enough to enable all of them
to appropriate it.
In sum, the work presented in this chapter shows a concrete example, with a particular kind
of technology called Zora, of a praxis-based civic education program with a constructionist
use of technology. This work opens up new lines of inquiry to explore questions regarding
the impact of on-line civic learning experiences, such as the ones both young children and
incoming freshmen had with Zora, on the off-line “real life.” For example, is participation
in virtual communities affecting youth’s civic engagement in face-to-face communities? Are
standard on-line technologies (such as e-mail and Internet portals) of value, or do we need
speciﬁcally designed technologies to promote civic engagement, such as Zora or similar
constructionist communities?
If we are going to allocate resources to the development of technology-based civic education programs, we also need to understand the role of adults and mentors. A lot is known
about the role of mentors in both on-line communities and face-to-face programs, but what
characteristics do mentors need to have to be versatile in both worlds? Do mentors need to
be themselves civically engaged to serve the function of role models?
Finally, technological ﬂuency—deﬁned by Seymour Papert as the ability to use and apply
technology in a ﬂuent way, effortlessly and smoothly, as one does with language—involves
mastering not only technological skills and concepts but also the ability to learn new ways
of using computers in a creative and personally meaningful way. During the process of using
the technology in a creative way, people are also likely to develop new ways of thinking;
therefore the computer’s role goes far beyond being an instrumental machine. Thus, we need
to understand what level of technological ﬂuency students need to have in order to beneﬁt
from technology-based interventions to foster civic engagement?
It is not the goal of this chapter to answer these questions, but simply to pose them. As
new research involving new media and civic engagement starts to emerge and the ﬁeld is
establishing itself as an important area in both civic education and educational technologies, the hope is that these questions will illuminate some possible directions for academic
research, policy decision making, and practical implementation. While a growing amount
of research and educational programs show the beneﬁts of the Internet to gain knowledge
about politics and therefore make use of instructionist technologies and knowledge-based
approaches, this chapter focuses on how the Internet can provide a safe space to experiment
with civic life, by forming on-line communities that extend and augment the possibilities of
young people to engage in face-to-face civic conversations, attitudes, and behaviors. This is a
less explored terrain that makes use of constructionist technologies and praxis-based models,
as presented by Zora.

Our Space: Online Civic Engagement Tools for Youth
Kate Raynes-Goldie and Luke Walker
TakingITGlobal Research
Introduction
The Internet is quickly becoming an integral part of life. The embedded role of the Internet
in everyday life is perhaps most prevalent for youth, particularly in developed countries: in
2005, the PEW Internet & American Life Project found that 87 percent of American teens go
online, and half of them report going online every day.1 Many “real world” activities can
now take place online—including many social-networking and community-building tasks
that go well beyond traditional uses of information and communication technologies. Civic
engagement, as other authors in this volume have presented, is one of the areas of activity
that has made the transition to the online realm, with varied forms of implementation and
varying degrees of success.
There is currently no established methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of online
civic engagement sites, for youth or other segments of the population. We believe a shift
in perspective of what civic engagement is and how it could occur online is necessary to
evaluate the sites, methodologies, and tools that promote civic engagement among youth.
Just as Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia, argues that social software should empower rather
than replace traditional forms of interaction, we see the role of online civic engagement tools
as enhancing and empowering real-world action:
A lot of programmers, seem to me to think that the whole point of social software is to replace the
social with the software. Which is not really what you want to do, right? Social Software should exist to
empower us to be human . . . to interact . . . in all the normal ways that humans do.2
Preliminary research points toward this paradigm shift. Research conducted by Michael
Delli Carpini,3 of the Annenberg School of Communications, as well as research conducted
by TakingITGlobal for the J. W. McConnell Family Foundation,4 have found that efforts
in the online civic engagement space are often more strongly suited for enabling or more
deeply engaging young people who are already civically minded. MySpace and digital youth
expert danah boyd has blogged5 and written extensively about the importance of the latest
generation of online spaces for youth in developed countries who, for various reasons, have
low access to physical hangout spaces, such as the mall or the park.6 MySpace is so popular,
she argues, because it acts as a digital public space where youth can hang out online with

Civic Life Online
their friends. So, providing civic engagement opportunities online—where youth already
spend their time—has great potential. It is accessible, familiar, and does not ask youth to
change their habits or step outside their comfort zones to get involved.
We have found that interactive Web sites and online communities aimed at promoting
civic engagement, activism, or community involvement among youth are generally facilitators of the civic engagement that occurs in the ofﬂine world, but not necessarily the
places where that engagement occurs. Our initial research shows that this role of online
civic engagement tools is a valuable precursor to engaging young people in their physical
communities.
Drawing on the work of Montgomery, Gottlieb-Robles, and Larson,7 we deﬁne civic engagement as any activity aimed at improving one’s community. Our initial ﬁndings point
to online civic engagement sites as primarily facilitators of action, rather than places of action. While actions such as writing to an ofﬁcial or signing a petition are positive actions
that do occur online, the majority of civic engagement activities resulting from online engagement actually happen in the ofﬂine world. Online engagement sites are facilitators of
these ofﬂine activities, providing access to three keys of change: information, people, and
tools to organize. These sites enable youth to access information about issues, other relevant organizations, and how to take action effectively. They can connect with their peers to
get feedback and support, and organize around issues important to them. Armed with the
support of like-minded individuals, tools to organize, and the right information, youth are
empowered by these Web sites to step out into the ofﬂine world to volunteer, raise awareness,
educate others, and start their own organizations.
This chapter consists of three parts. First, we present an overview of TakingITGlobal (TIG),
where we are both employed. TIG runs TakingITGlobal.org, one of the largest and most
sophisticated civic engagement sites in the world. Its purpose is to develop the capacity of
young people to effect change in their communities. TakingITGlobal.org was one of the ﬁrst
of a growing number of interactive and social online engagement sites. Over ﬁve million
people from around the world have visited since it was launched in 2000.
Second, we present initial ﬁndings from a survey we conducted to discover how young
people are using TakingITGlobal.org and other online civic, community, or activist sites.
Our aim was to ﬁnd out how youth are using online tools and to determine what civic
engagement activities they are involved in.
Finally, we look at these survey ﬁndings in the context of online community theory
to create a snapshot of the current landscape of online youth civic engagement. We then
conclude with a discussion of key learnings and areas for improvement. We hope our ﬁndings
will be useful in guiding future developments of online civic engagement sites.
TakingITGlobal: New Tools for Youth-led Engagement
TakingITGlobal.org grew from the recognition that youth are not apathetic about social issues; rather they lack access to appealing forms of engagement. Working with this concept,
Jennifer Corriero, Michael Furdyk, and a team of other young people launched TakingIT-
Global.org in 2000. In its early iterations, the site had member and organizational proﬁles
and discussion boards. Other tools, from blogs to an online art gallery, to project planning tools followed.8 The site has evolved into a complex platform tying together the core
tools that young people use so readily—blogs, discussions boards, podcasts, and instant
messaging—combined with collaborative action-planning tools, background information

on a broad area of social issues, and connections to relevant organizations, groups, and their
The development of the TakingITGlobal.org platform has been driven by user feedback
and feature requests. TakingITGlobal.org registered its 100,000th member in the fall of 2005
and at the time of writing had over 130,000 members from two hundred countries (see
Table 1). Through the efforts of a global team of volunteers, TakingITGlobal.org is available in
English, French, Spanish, Russian, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Turkish, Chinese,
and Arabic. The site is further localized with country sites, or portals to country-speciﬁc
information. The average member is twenty-two years old and spends an average of thirtyfour minutes per session on the TIG site.9
The TakingITGlobal.org online community is accessible and available to anyone with an
Internet connection, anywhere in the world. The site supports learning, dialogue, collaboration and action on key topics, including:
Arts and media
Culture and identity
Human rights and equity
Learning and education
Environment and urbanization
Work and economics
Health and wellness
Peace, conﬂict and governance
Technology and innovation
Social, Organizational, and Informational Tools
TakingITGlobal.org provides many tools similar to those of commercial social networking or
online community sites, but it does so within the context of civic engagement. In their book
Wikinomics, Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams describe the key difference between
TakingITGlobal.org and its commercial counterparts:
Like MySpace and Facebook, TakingITGlobal harnesses all of the latest tools, such as blogging, instant
messaging, and media sharing. But it promotes a decidedly different kind of social networking. Rather
than list their favorite movie stars and music tracks, members list information about the languages they
Civic Life Online
speak, the countries they have visited and the issues they’re most concerned about. Members link to
other members’ proﬁles when they share similar interests, and those links create social connections that
lead to new friendships and projects.10
The other key difference between TakingITGlobal.org and its commercial counterparts
is that TakingITGlobal.org embeds its social-networking tools within the context of civic
engagement and activism by providing relevant resources and informational tools (organization databases, issue directories, etc.). These tools allow members to ﬁnd and share the
information they need to create change in their communities. The information and resources found on the site are created by members and by TakingITGlobal staff or partners.
The beneﬁts of integrating tools that connect people with informational tools are twofold.
First, it provides access to two key ingredients for action: people and information. Second, in
providing youth-friendly social tools such as blogs and proﬁles, youth are engaged on their
own terms and with the same types of tools they are already familiar with and use everyday.
Providing youth with access on their own terms means they are more likely to engage.
TakingITGlobal.org’s social tools consist of standard Web tools (see Table 4): blogs, pro-
ﬁles, and social-networking tools, a Web messenger and discussion forums, all of which help
members to ﬁnd, connect, and network with each other. TakingITGlobal.org also provides
tools for organizing, such as Projects and Groups, which its commercial counterparts such
as MySpace and Facebook, lack. These tools help members to organize around an issue or
project. The informational tools on TakingITGlobal.org revolve around member content
and include Understanding the Issues, the Global Gallery (photography), Member Stories,
Panorama (creative writing), Intersections (mixed media), and TIG Magazine. Members also
have access to extensive directories of events, organizations, and professional opportunities,
to which they can add as well as search. These directories help members ﬁnd volunteer
opportunities, youth-serving organizations or events focused on various social issues and
decision-making processes, such as the World Summit on the Information Society. TakingIT-
Global.org also provides downloadable resources such as the Workshop Kit, Guide to Action,
and information on running Open Forums.
All of the social, organizational, and informational tools on TakingITGlobal.org are tightly
integrated and linked. For example, most of the items that are listed on a proﬁle page are
clickable, leading to related resources or lists—so clicking a name of a project on someone’s
proﬁle will direct you to the Project page. This makes it easy for members to move between
informing themselves on a resource page and taking action through a community tool. It
also makes it easier to ﬁnd other members interested in the same issues.
Bridging Ofﬂine and Online Engagement
TakingITGlobal consists of two intertwined yet distinct areas—TakingITGlobal’s online community (TakingITGlobal.org) and its ofﬂine engagement areas. Most of TakingITGlobal’s of-
ﬂine engagement activities are strongly linked or supported through the online components.
Reﬂecting the generation it serves, TakingITGlobal does not strongly distinguish between online and ofﬂine engagement.
TakingITGlobal’s ofﬂine engagement focuses on increasing the collaboration between
youth-serving organizations both regionally and globally, and mainstreaming youth involvement into international processes, such as United Nations summits. Creating Local Connections (CLC) provides local staff support to youth-serving organizations. Their
role is to facilitate the effective use of TakingITGlobal.org tools to better collaborate and
overcome some of the barriers speciﬁc to youth-led organizations.11 The CLC program

In 2004, Microsoft Russia funded the CLC pilot, which won an award for best youth Internet project for youth at Russia’s Festival of Youth Non-Commercial Projects.12 The Russian
CLC project began with the translation of the site into Russian ( 
one of TIG’s ﬁrst multilingual efforts. By the end of the yearlong project, TIG’s Russian
membership had grown by nine hundred individuals and eighty organizations.
In 2006 the J. W. McConnell Family Foundation funded a three-year cross-Canada version of CLC. The program placed a coordinator in each province and territory, and engaged
Francophone and Aboriginal Engagement Coordinators to meet the needs of these populations. In 2007, the West African version of CLC will implement the program in several
countries in the region. In each country, local TIG staff works within partner organizations,
reaching out to local organizations in their region, and building a substantial body of locally
relevant content on the TakingITGlobal.org site.
International political or economic events present a set of participation barriers for young
people. While critical decisions affecting the lives of young people are often made through
major international policy processes, there is frequently little or no opportunity for youth
engagement. Even if there is no formal barrier to youth involvement, such as registration
restrictions, there are often logistical or ﬁnancial obstacles. The UN World Summit on the
Information Society (WSIS) in 2005 was a major opportunity for TIG, as it addressed the
digital divide, a major area of interest for many TakingITGlobal.org members. Working with
a coalition of youth-led and youth-serving organizations, TIG facilitated the youth caucus,
mainstreaming youth participation into the Summit. Through the coalition’s work, not only
was there a prominent youth presence at the Summit, but hundreds of young people attended
the WSIS preparatory meetings, running and speaking on high-level panels and lobbying
delegates.13 Throughout the process, young people were able to use TakingITGlobal.org’s
tools throughout the process to learn how to contribute and to share experiences with each
The XVI International AIDS Conference, held in Toronto in August 2006, presented TIG
with another opportunity to mainstream youth participation. TIG and its partners Family
Health International, the Global Youth Coalition on HIV/AIDS, along with several other
organizations, worked together as the Toronto Youth Force. Representatives of the Youth
Force were involved in all aspects of conference planning, including the development
of an ofﬁcial Youth Program for the conference. TIG developed the Youth Program site
( and ensured that the content created by over a thousand youth
delegates would be sustained well beyond the short life of the typical conference Web site.
By tying the conference’s youth site to TIG’s existing tools and user system, it ensured that
youth media and networks created at the conference would exist simultaneously both online
and ofﬂine, and continue to exist once the conference organizers shut down the main site.
Through the organization’s work with networks like the Global Youth Coalition on
HIV/AIDS (GYCA) and the Youth Employment Summit (YES), TakingITGlobal.org has, in
many ways, become a network of networks. This precedent was set early on, when Nation1,
an outgrowth of the MIT Media Lab’s Junior Summit, decided to move its network to the
TakingITGlobal.org site, rather than launching its own.14 Work with groups like YES has
drawn groups of active youth into the TakingITGlobal.org community, who can then serve
as valuable mentors and sources of inspiration for other members.

TakingITGlobal.org’s Tools in Action
Bossman Boakye, a TakingITGlobal member from Ghana, provided us with this story of how
he used TakingITGlobal’s tools to start a civic engagement organization in his country:
I got in touch with a friend who happened to be a member of TIG three years ago and he introduced me to this
great site.
At ﬁrst, what I used to check on the site was events and opportunities. I had a great zeal to travel to any youth
programme so I found this site very interesting and worthy of links to youth events around the world.
During one of these searches, I came across an information on World Assembly and I decided to write to them
to ask for more information. I was replied with the information that a new initiative known as Student World
Assembly was in the pipeline to be introduced and that I could join and make inputs. Basically, this initiative
seeks to promote democracy and civic participation globally.
I presented a proposal to the ofﬁcials of Student World Assembly on the setting up of the organisation in Ghana.
I must say that this is where TIG became of immense beneﬁt to me. I had to visit the discussion board (English
section) to discuss my idea with other people. I also read more on democracy and other issues the SWA was
discussing on their website www.studentworldassembly.org on Understanding Issues. It is during one of my visits

to this site when I met a friend who also shared in my initiative and visions and who also happened to be a
We met and he took me on a visit to very beneﬁcial links at TIG website for me where I got to know how to write
proposals, start up youth and students NGOs, fundraising, etc.
I must say that, TIG has helped me a lot in setting up Student World Assembly in Ghana which can now boast
of over 10 established chapters in tertiary institutions in Ghana.
I am now the programmes and growth ofﬁcer for the organization and I link up my success and excellence to
TIG; I must say that it is a great site for youth endeavours.
This type of story provides insight into how youth are actually using different online tools,
such as those of TakingITGlobal.org, to engage and make positive changes in their communities. This and similar anecdotes provide evidence of the efﬁcacy of TakingITGlobal.org’s role
in assisting youth in making positive change.15 Several project areas are working on implementing evaluation structures, including the education program and CLC Canada. Results
of these more systematic research efforts will be available in late 2007.

Funding and Sustainability
TakingITGlobal operates on a budget of approximately $1 million. Its education and
local engagement programs are funded by grants from the J. W. McConnell Family Foundation, Walter & Duncan Gordon Foundation, Royal Bank Financial Group,
Microsoft, and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). Though critical, grant funding has limitations especially when most grants occur on a one-time basis and offer no guarantees for renewed commitment. Project-based funding has been
accessed from the UN Millennium Campaign to create campaign kits on the Millennium Development Goals, and from UNESCO to run a project on urban violence and
TIG’s other major source of funding is technology development work. TIG leverages the
customized platform it has created for its own online community to build similar tools for
other organizations, ranging from the Digital Divide Network ( 
which has since become an internal project of TakingITGlobal) to Greenpeace, Oxfam

Canada, and the Adventure Ecology. This strategy provides partners with excellent online
tools that would otherwise be unaffordable, while simultaneously giving TakingITGlobal access to new tools to incorporate into its own online community. A project with the Youth
Employment Summit ( for example, led to the development of
TakingITGlobal’s project pages, now a core offering that allows any TIG member to create,
manage, and promote an action project.16
Increasingly, TakingITGlobal’s education program ( is a source
of membership growth and ﬁnancial sustainability. TIGed is a virtual classroom system combined with educational materials developed from TakingITGlobal.org content,
allowing educators to create authentic learning experiences about global issues by using tools students are familiar with. Reaching out to teachers helps to involve those
students who are not already engaged or civically minded, in addition to appealing to
those who are looking to become more or better engaged. TIGed has created new opportunities for TIG to generate revenue from users: whereas individual membership is
free, teachers, schools, and districts are charged for the additional tools that TIGed

Youth Survey Findings
Presently, no methodology exists for evaluating the efﬁcacy of online civic engagement sites.
This lack of framework and standardized metrics are a barrier to funding and delivering the
best tools for facilitating the ofﬂine civic engagement of youth. In deciding to conduct a survey of both TakingITGlobal members and online youth generally, we wanted to take the ﬁrst
steps toward discovering and assessing the ofﬂine impact of online engagement. We know
anecdotally that youth are using TakingITGlobal.org’s tools to better their communities, but
we have not been able to map the connections between the online tools and ofﬂine youth
engagement. We wanted to uncover TakingITGlobal.org’s role in facilitating the outcomes
our members have reported, and ﬁnd out more speciﬁcally which tools TakingITGlobal.org
members were using and how. We also wanted to know more about how youth—both
TakingITGlobal.org members and others—were using other online tools and sites, and what
actions they might be taking as a result.
For two weeks in the fall of 2006, we conducted an exploratory survey, promoted through
TakingITGlobal.org and several other blog sites, to uncover how young people use online
tools for the purposes of civic engagement. The survey solicited 769 responses from both
members of TakingITGlobal.org and youth who found our survey through a number of other
blog sites (classiﬁed as “Other Respondents” in Tables 2 and 3): 46.6 percent of respondents
were male and 50.5 percent female (the remainder did not indicate their gender); 18.3 percent
of respondents were under the age of twenty-one, 75.16 percent were between twentyone and thirty, and 1.95 percent were thirty-one or older. The remainder did not indicate
their age. The survey received responses from 111 countries. The top ten countries with the
most respondents were Canada (146), the United States (50), Philippines (45), Australia (44),
Nigeria (42), Pakistan (33), the United Kingdom (32), Kenya (24), Turkey (22), and India (21).
We learned that young people who are interested in civic, community, or activist issues
are looking to the Internet for information about causes important to them, connections to
like-minded peers and organizations, and for ways to organize and mobilize. When these
needs are met, youth report in our qualitative section that they are able to make positive
change in their lives and in their communities, demonstrating that the action or result of
online engagement is occurring ofﬂine.
The youth survey consisted of two sets of questions: one set focused on the uses of online
tools for civic engagement and the other on TakingITGlobal.org’s toolset. As the responses
indicate (Tables 2 and 3), young people who responded to our survey are interested in civic
issues, and that interest can lead them to take ofﬂine action.
Survey respondents were asked to characterize their behavior as NA/Never, Rarely, Sometimes, and Often. The tables below summarize the percentage of Often responses for the two
survey groups: TakingITGlobal.org members and general online youth respondents.
While this is a sample of young people who are more likely to be engaged according to their
online activities, we note that the participation rate in voting is 64.7 percent and those likely
to attend events aimed at effecting change is 43 percent. Yet there is room for improvement
in the other action areas.
Several other researchers in this ﬁeld, including Montgomery, Gottleib-Robles, and
Larson,17 have noted that while young people for the most part seem to have an interest in the issues affecting their communities, this interest is only modestly translated into
action. In his chapter in this volume, Bennett points to the “withering away of civic education in schools”18 as a possible factor. Corriero and Furdyk, TakingITGlobal’s founders,

offer a different explanation for this low participation rates in other action areas than voting
and attending events. They believe there is a disconnect between the available opportunities
for engagement and the spaces where young people spend their time. In other words, civic
institutions and initiatives are simply not keeping up with the times.19
Our survey ﬁndings indicated that TakingITGlobal.org’s tools were primarily used for three
Support and motivation
Networking and information
Mobilizing and organizing real-world action
In questions relating to the use of TakingITGlobal.org’s tools for these purposes, 40 percent or more of TakingITGlobal.org respondents gave positive responses. They also provided numerous qualitative responses indicating their use of these tools for these three
Support and Motivation
Of the 501 TakingITGlobal.org members who responded to the survey:
73.9 percent agreed that “through my experience with TakingITGlobal, my perception
of the ability of youth to affect change in the world has improved;
63.5 percent agreed that “I have been inspired by a young person I have read about
and/or communicated with on the TakingITGlobal site.”
Civic Life Online
Qualitative responses further conﬁrm that the online presence of a large network of youth
leaders is in and of itself a great value to many TakingITGlobal.org members. As we discuss in
our landscape survey in the next section, having the right people engaged in an online community is just as important as its functionality. Allan, from the United Kingdom, mentioned
that “the key [motivator] was reassurance that there were other people out there trying as
well—we are not alone.”
Networking and Information
Beyond ﬁnding inspiration, many TakingITGlobal.org members reported ﬁnding information and networks to help them take steps toward action:
41.9 percent of respondents agreed that they “had contacted an organization listed in
TakingITGlobal.org’s database.”
54.1 percent of respondents agreed that “the site has helped them become more informed about issues important to them.”
In their qualitative responses, TIG members mentioned their ability to connect with peers
through the site as a key factor in their projects:
I liaised with another TakingITGlobal member to produce a 30-second TV commercial that was shown
on the local community cable TV channel and on YouTube. That commercial drove 10,000 people to our
non-proﬁt community event and was the key inﬂuence in driving 179,000 hits to the Web site.—Ginger,
Some of the young people have been contacting me through TakingITGlobal and we have been connected from that time until now and sometimes it results to a project where we develop program
exchanges in 2 countries.—Albert, Rwanda
Clearly, networking and information are some of TIG’s key value-adds. The organization
operates on the assumption that through the opportunity to connect easily and efﬁciently
with young leaders in their areas of interest, more active members will inspire less active
members to take action. This has been a key driver in the organization’s decision to work
with networks like the Global Youth Coalition on HIV/AIDS. TakingITGlobal.org gives any
approved, youth-serving organization the opportunity to quickly, and freely, publicize their
work to tens of thousands of daily visitors to TakingITGlobal.org.20 This dissemination feature
has proven to be of particular beneﬁt to smaller organizations that have less capacity to
create their own highly visible Web sites. Members of these smaller organizations can also
take advantage of free project pages and mailing lists to organize and mobilize.
Mobilizing and Organizing to Real-World Action
44.1 percent of respondents agreed that “the information, networks, and tools to mobilize and organize found on TakingITGlobal.org have helped them make change in lives
or community.”
49.5 percent of respondents indicated that “TakingITGlobal.org had helped them to
change something in their own lives.”
While this survey has only begun to probe the changes that young people are making
in the “real world” using TakingITGlobal.org’s tools and online community, many respondents attribute the decision to engage or refocus their engagement projects to their involvement with the site. George, a respondent from Malawi, reported, “One of the very ﬁrst
inspirations I got from my involvement with TakingITGlobal was to set up an information
centre (www.cridoc.net) on child/youth rights issues in Malawi.” Other members had similar
stories, ranging from an education campaign around Hepatitis B vaccinations in Ghana to
the republication of an article about forced migration in a major Ugandan newspaper.
While these anecdotes are just that, they do provide a positive indication that involvement
in TakingITGlobal.org is producing a more engagement-oriented attitude among youth.
These ﬁndings should not be surprising, given that YouthNoise, a similar site reviewed in the
next section, reports similar ﬁndings: “Studies have shown that YouthNoise participation has
led to a 25 percent increase in volunteering and a 90 percent increase in the global awareness
of users from modestly aware to highly aware.”21
Putting TIG in Context: A Look at Other Sites
TakingITGlobal.org and the sites we look at in this section all use varying combinations of
a standard set of online tools. These tools are used in a variety of contexts for a range of
purposes and are all popular with youth. Not only are these tools important for engaging
youth on their own terms—they have all been shown to be useful for ﬁnding and sharing
information, networking with peers and organizing. The Pew Internet Report on Teens and
Technology also conﬁrms that American teens are using these tools in other contexts, such
as ﬁnding health information or socializing.22 Table 4 provides a summary of these standard
online tools and how they are used in the context of youth civic engagement:
Landscape Survey Methodology
The initial results of our youth survey suggest that youth
are using TakingITGlobal.org as a source of information and people through its informational
tools, resources, and social networking features. They are also using the site to mobilize
and organize, which leads to action in their ofﬂine communities. Based on these ﬁndings,
we believe that the most important goals of civic engagement sites should be to facilitate
these online activities. With this in mind, we set out to examine the current landscape
of online civic engagement and report on best practices and areas for improvement. We
hope that this will inform future online civic engagement projects and improving existing
In order to create a snapshot of the current online civic engagement landscape we developed two screens. First, a screen to identify the sites for inclusion in our survey and, second,
a screen to tease out the strengths and areas for improvement in the strategies and toolsets
of the sites we examined.
To ensure that we examined comparable sites, we established a set of minimum criteria to
determine which sites would be included in our survey. Speciﬁcally, a social networking or
online community site must
Be aimed at youth, or have a relatively large youth membership
Have an interactive Web-based social tool at its core that allows members to interact
Be current and operational (site is accessible and usable)
Be available in English
Be aimed at encouraging and supporting positive social change.
Our initial survey universe consisted of twenty-three potential sites. These sites were identiﬁed by experts in the ﬁeld of online civic engagement, links from popular sites, and sites

examined in other surveys.23 We examined each one by signing up and systematically trying each feature. Out of the twenty-three sites, only six met our minimum criteria to be
included in our survey. The top two reasons for exclusion in our survey were that the
site was no longer operational or that the site did not include an interactive social component and was simply a static Web page. The six sites we surveyed were YouthNoise,
CampusActivism, UNICEF Voices of Youth,24 Youth Action Net, Zaadz, and BattleCry.25
We also included TakingITGlobal.org, which we more thoroughly analyzed in the previous
Because there is currently no established methodology for evaluating online civic engagement sites, we adapted a survey methodology from an online community evaluation
framework created by Clarisse De Souza and Jenny Preece.26 De Souza and Preece deﬁne communities and social networks as combinations of two key elements: technology (usability)
and sociability (policy, purpose, and people). Blogger Sarah Pullman noted the same element
in her analysis of Zaadz: “there are two things that determine the value of social networking
tools: (1) the functionality of the tools themselves, and what they allow people to do, and
(2) the people who are using the service.”27 Having the most sophisticated and easy-to-use
online community platform does not guarantee success, nor does having access to a large
number of members. A site has to be relatively usable and have appealing technology so that
people can easily accomplish their goals, just as it has to have a critical mass of the right
kind of users. If the tools are frustrating, or there are very few members, a site is not likely to
be used. As MySpace demonstrates, successful online communities do not necessarily have
to be the best designed, but at least have the right people.
The functionality and type of tools on a site matter for two reasons. First, the site has
to have tools that are appealing, familiar, and useful enough so that youth will use them.
Second, the site has to facilitate activities that help youth reach their civic engagement
goals. These activities, as we found in our youth survey, are ﬁnding the right information,
organizing, networking, and collaborating. For this reason, we examined not only what
types of tools were on the sites examined (proﬁles, blogs, tags, and so on) but also how
sophisticated those tools were. For example, the blogging tools across the sites we examined
varied greatly in terms of features and functionality and thus their appeal, familiarity, and
usefulness to youth.
We also kept in mind the inﬂuence of commercial services. Although not aimed at civic
engagement, MySpace and Facebook set the tone and expectations for many youth (especially
those in developed countries). If these expectations are not met, they are not likely to use or
keep using a site. Keeping all this in mind, we based our survey on three key areas: usability,
people, and purpose and policy.
In usability, we looked at technology and design issues, such as

Overview of Web Sites Reviewed
In Table 5, we summarize the history and key features of the seven sites we reviewed in
Landscape Survey Findings Usability
Despite vast differences in the tools offered by the
sites surveyed, ﬁve of the seven had discussion forums. Forums were the primary means
of communication on UNICEF Voice of Youth and Youth Action Network, while the others used a suite of communication tools including forums. Forums are among the oldest
communication styles online, and operate in a manner similar to e-mail lists, which are
popular in low-connectivity situations. As a result, discussion forums are more familiar
and accessible to youth with limited connectivity. Sites that only offer discussion forums
may however discourage youth with more sophisticated Internet literacy, as this group
expects the latest innovations from the sites they use. Anything less may inadvertently
imply that the site’s makers “don’t get it.” The two sites with the most members (TakingITGlobal.org and YouthNoise) offered multiple modes of communication to members. This
way, few users are directly excluded, and youth have access to the tools they are most familiar
Only two of seven sites featured formal collaboration tools to help youth organize around
their goals. TakingITGlobal.org and YouthNoise both offer project pages that allow groups
to publicize and coordinate their projects, using mailing lists and a shared online workspace.
Youth Action Net offers project pages for displaying information, but does not provide
collaboration features.
Problems with site design and usability were common. Many sites deviated from the standard conventions of usability as recommended by experts such as Steven Krug.28 Navigation
and ﬁndability were—in varying degrees—a challenge. On YouthNoise, for example, the
navigation menu, visual queues and naming conventions all change from one part of the
site to the next, which can be confusing for users. We noticed a similar problem with Youth
Action Net, whose navigation menu inconsistently featured a prominent yet broken link
to an essay contest. The navigation menu also appears on the left side of the front page,
even though it is oriented on the right side everywhere else. Usability was also a problem
for TakingITGlobal. In our youth survey, a number of TakingITGlobal members mentioned
that the site was becoming overwhelming. Getting an idea of the goals or features of many
of the sites was not easy, with most sites offering a complicated and jargon-ﬁlled mission
statement to inform. These design and usability issues can not only harm a site’s image but,
more important, can make it harder for youth to ﬁnd the necessary information and people
to affect change in their communities. If a site is too difﬁcult to use, less savvy Internet users
will be discouraged and potentially excluded.

Voices of Youth was originally founded
in 1995 so that youth around the
world could send messages to world
leaders at the World Summit for
Social Development which was held
that year in Copenhagen.g Today, the
goal of the site is “To offer all children
and adolescents, including the
hard-to-reach, a safe and supportive
global cyberspace within which they
can explore, discuss, and partner on
issues related to human rights and
social change, as well as develop their
awareness, leadership, community
building, and critical thinking skills
through active and substantive
participation with their peers and
with decision makers globally.”h

Unlike the other sites we looked at,
Zaadz is entirely a social utility like
Facebook and as such, has no
signiﬁcant static informational or
resource components. In other words,
Zaadz is more like an application
than a Web page because it is more
interactive than all the other sites we
have examined.
Zaadz was the only site we looked that
is for proﬁt. It was also the most
sophisticated and well designed of all
the sites and the only one to use
AJAX, a new programming technique
that makes Web sites act more like
applications than static web pages.

We noticed maintenance issues on some sites. Like other software, Web sites often break
due to updates, bugs, hacking, spam, or other user interventions. Even outgoing links must
be updated regularly to avoid broken links, a common problem among the sites reviewed.
While broken links are annoying, lack of proper site maintenance can prevent youth from
getting involved entirely. We received an error when trying to sign up with UNICEF Voices of
Youth, which prevented us from proceeding, and an e-mail to the technical support address
went unanswered. This sort of experience can be frustrating for users and can cause them to
lose interest or avoid the site in the future.
Ensuring that the systems behind a site are running smoothly is vital. Many of the sites
we surveyed have implemented some degree of moderation. For example, Youth Action
Net requires approval for member-created Web and project pages. Our submission to the
Youth Action Net was still unapproved after four months, and the overall number of project
and member pages listed had not changed during that time either, indicating a problem
in the process. In this case, a lack of maintenance actually prevents members from using
a core feature of the site. As we discuss in the next section on key learnings, these maintenance problems relate to issues of sustainability and funding, common challenges for
The only sites free of these particular problems were Zaadz and BattleCry, both of which
appear well funded. The former is the for-proﬁt creation of two successful entrepreneurs29
and the latter is operated by a large evangelical parachurch organization, with an in-house
marketing department and guidance from top interactive advertising agency Tocquigny.30
Also, BattleCry and Zaadz were created in the past year, whereas the rest emerged between
1995 and 2002, an entirely different era of Web design and functionality.
Purpose, Policy, and People
All of the sites we examined focused on civic engagement,
community involvement and improvement, or activism. Within that lens, a wide spectrum
of purposes emerged. BattleCry aims primarily at recruiting American youth to Evangelical
Christianity. UNICEF Voices of Youth aims to give a voice to underserved children and teens
around the world and provide rights education. Zaadz, a social-networking site for “spiritual
activists,” is not explicitly youth-focused, but the majority of its members are aged eighteen
to thirty-ﬁve.
Despite the range of audiences and goals, ﬁve of the seven sites use a very similar strategy to
engage and empower youth: a focus on providing information and facilitating connections
and networking. Similarly, almost all the sites connected their online tools with ofﬂine
action—some, such as Youth Action Net or TIG, with very explicit ofﬂine programs. This
aligns with the initial ﬁndings of our youth survey, that youth use online tools to get what
they need to make change ofﬂine: information, people, and organizing.
The exceptions were BattleCry and Zaadz, both of which use slightly different strategies
than the remainder of the group. Zaadz has no static resource sections, unlike the other
sites examined, nor does it make a clear connection between online tools and ofﬂine action.
Rather, it is a sophisticated social-networking tool focused solely on helping people ﬁnd and
connect with each other. Beyond that, its strategy to help its members make positive change
is unclear.
BattleCry stands out for an entirely different reason. BattleCry, like Zaadz, is primarily a
social-networking site and less an informational resource. However, the similarities between
the two sites stop there. Zaadz, and the other sites we examined, facilitated and encouraged
bottom-up organic organization and communication among their members, focusing on
Civic Life Online
enabling and guiding youth. Using Coleman’s terminology from the following chapter, they
are all examples of relatively autonomous citizenship. BattleCry, in contrast, took a very topdown or managed approach with a focus on instructing youth. The site’s suggested strategies
for individual and community improvement reﬂected this methodology, as did the tools it
provided. The strategies are rigid and narrow, with little room for interpretation. The same
is true of the site’s tools: BattleCry only allows one-to-one or small group communication
between members. The only group functionality is linked to church membership, and each
member is limited to association with one church, limiting any individual’s potential reach.
The only one-to-many communication tool on BattleCry was a discussion forum, which was
locked shortly after the site launched in 2006.
BattleCry is the only site that has created an online tool to direct and measure ofﬂine
action. The tool allows members to list their “warrior disciplines” and “battle tactics” on
their proﬁles, with a meter indicating their progress. Examples of the predetermined options
include “I will recommit to be submissive to my parents” and “I will read BattleCry for My
Generation [a book published by BattleCry itself] and give it to others in my youth group to
read.” While innovative, the tool ﬁts with the rigidity of the site.
The number of members on the sites varied greatly. The most populated sites, TakingIT-
Global and YouthNoise, each had well over 100,000 members, while the least populated,
the Activism Network and Youth Action Net, had 3700 members and 400 member pages,
respectively.31 While TakingITGlobal and YouthNoise both have large memberships, when
considered in relation to MySpace ,
it is evident that the online civic engagement space still has a largely untapped potential
audience.32
Part of our criteria for inclusion in the survey was the availability of the site in English,
so it was no surprise to ﬁnd that most of the members of the sites we examined were
English speakers. It is notable, however, that there are very few multilingual civic engagement or activist sites. Only two of the sites we examined (including those not included in the ﬁnal survey) were available in multiple languages; the rest were only in
English. TakingITGlobal is available in eleven languages and UNICEF Voices of Youth
in four. This lack of linguistic diversity restricts the accessibility of these sites for many
youth globally, and even in North America, where languages other than English are
Despite these overarching similarities, we noticed a great deal of difference among users,
no doubt the result of the differing purposes of each site. BattleCry consists of American
Christian youth, while UNICEF Voices of Youth caters to underserved children and teens
from around the globe. Zaadz, aimed at a very speciﬁc crowd of “spiritual activists” has a
large number of young members, but only 1 percent are under eighteen.
Learnings and Improvements
The results of our landscape survey can be summarized as follows:
Most sites had maintenance, design, and/or usability issues, which made them less
accessible and appealing for youth
All the sites but one were nonproﬁt and NGO-run, and relied primarily on donations,
volunteers, or sponsorships for their funding
Robust and sophisticated collaboration tools were lacking
Within the overarching goals of engaging and empowering youth by providing them
with information and networking with their peers, there was still a diversity of purposes,
policies and members
Very few sites are offered in multiple languages
There was a range of membership levels
Sustainability
Given the problems we identiﬁed with site maintenance, design, and usability, funding and
sustainability is clearly a challenge for all the sites surveyed. Dynamic Web sites are like
plants: they need nurturing and care. Deliberate and ongoing care is even more important
considering the high expectations created by well-funded and maintained commercial sites.
Therefore, the people and organizations behind online activist, community, and civic engagement sites must develop revenue streams to ensure their sites receive appropriate support
and maintenance.
LiveJournal presents an interesting alternative solution. LiveJournal is a large community
blogging site popular with youth, founded by early blogger Brad Fitzpatrick while he was
still in college. Before Six Apart purchased it in early 2005, LiveJournal was supported by a
large group of volunteer members who provided technical and community support as well
as technical development. Member suggestions for improvements and features also factored
heavily into the development of the site. By involving their members in the day-to-day
management of the site, LiveJournal not only created a large, strong, and loyal membership
but was also able to stretch their minimal resources. Compared to the sites we examined in
our landscape survey, LiveJournal has had very few maintenance, usability, or design issues.
Although LiveJournal is not focused on civic or community engagement, it has nonetheless
empowered and engaged many of its young users in a meaningful way, and has given them
the ability to inﬂuence the development of their online community. Unfortunately, the
involvement of the community has diminished since Six Apart took control of LiveJournal
and brought in more paid staff.33
LiveJournal is the only example we have seen of members being so heavily involved in the
day-to-day operations of an online community. We contrast this with BattleCry, a site that
had almost no member input or involvement. Activist, community, and civic engagement
sites could beneﬁt greatly from involving their members as LiveJournal has. They could
potentially increase their membership by providing better tools and features to facilitate
networking and information access, and by creating a sense of ownership and loyalty. Creating better tools and increasing membership is not only good for the organizations, but
good for youth as well. The greater youth’s access to people, information, and organizational tools, the easier it is to accomplish civic engagement or community improvement
Almost across the board we observed usability and design issues, and a lack of robust collaborative tools. None of the sites we examined, except for the well-funded Zaadz and
BattleCry, met the level of sophistication or usability of their commercial counterparts.
It is vital that sites keep up with the state of the art set by commercial sites to ensure that youth are engaged in a way that is not only appealing but also highly effective. TakingITGlobal beneﬁts from having multiple in-house staff members dedicated to
Civic Life Online
technology development. YouthNoise, and to a lesser extent BattleCry, have both begun
to take resource-saving measures to keep up with the latest Internet trends. YouthNoise
has begun to feature embedded videos about current events and issues from the popular
video sharing site, YouTube, on its front page. BattleCry now asks members for submissions
via YouTube and provides banners that members can include on their MySpace proﬁles.
This sort of integration with commercial services allows sites to easily add new features
for their members, while also reaching out to youth who are sole users of commercial
Despite the global mandate of several of the sites we examined (including those not included
in our ﬁnal landscape survey), only two were available in more than one language. Given an
increasingly global world, it is important for activist, civic, and community engagement sites
to provide access in multiple languages, especially in countries with more than one ofﬁcial
language. In so doing, these sites will be better able to provide youth with access to their
peers in their most comfortable and functional linguistic environment. The importance of
having the right people using a site was demonstrated by the success of MySpace—youth
want to be where their friends are. Increasing the number of languages will not only increase
membership but also help youth ﬁnd the people they need to connect with to make the
change they want in their communities.
Translating a site into other languages can be a good way of getting youth directly engaged
with a site. TakingITGlobal was able to translate its site into eleven languages largely because
of the help of volunteer members. In many cases, these translation volunteers have also taken
on the role of promoting the site to build a local audience and locally relevant content. TakingITGlobal has been successful in reaching a global audience and has the largest membership
of all the sites we examined. LiveJournal used the same strategy for their site translation, and
as a result, has become a very popular blogging site in Russia (their second-largest member
base after the United States is Russia).34
Conclusion
Throughout this chapter, we have presented examples and possibilities of a growing movement of youth who inform and organize themselves online, and then proceed to take action
in their communities. We have also seen a growing movement of interactive online civic
engagement sites based around social tools, such as TakingITGlobal.org, aimed at facilitating youth engagement by providing access to peers, information and tools to mobilize and
organize. Yet, just like the movement, the research and feedback mechanisms are young and
in need of further development.
The most burning research question revolves around the development of an evaluation
methodology that assesses the efﬁcacy of online civic engagement sites, speciﬁcally the connection between online and ofﬂine preparation and action. We recommend further exploration of the initial ﬁndings from our youth survey: speciﬁcally more detailed investigations
into the use and potential improvements to online civic engagement sites for networking
with peers, ﬁnding information, and organizing.
We are excited about the potential of well-executed online civic engagement sites. When
youth are engaged on their own terms, we strongly believe that the future of young people
and positive change in the world will be bright.

Doing IT for Themselves: Management versus Autonomy
in Youth E-Citizenship
Stephen Coleman
University of Leeds, Institute of Communications Studies
“Don’t mention the war”
In most contemporary democracies, signiﬁcant energy and resources are being devoted to
the project of cultivating, shaping, and sustaining the next generation of citizens. While
everyone agrees that promoting citizenship is “a good thing,” there is rather less consensus
about the preferred forms or outcomes of civic behavior. A brief example from the recent
experience of citizenship education in the United Kingdom will help to illuminate this
contested terrain.
Citizenship education (the British equivalent of “civics”) was introduced into the English
and Welsh secondary school curriculum in 2001, following the recommendations of a report
produced by a Commission headed by the political theorist Bernard Crick that called for “no
less than a change in the political culture of this country.”1 Unlike U.S. civic education,
with its emphasis upon an “adaptative and conditioned, rather than active and critical”
approach,2 the British model of citizenship education aimed explicitly to nurture young
people who would be “individually conﬁdent in ﬁnding new forms of involvement and
action among themselves.”3 An appendix to the Crick Report acknowledged the potential
signiﬁcance of digital technologies, stating that “the interactive character of the Internet
provides opportunities for invigorating citizenship education.”4 The extent to which these
lofty aspirations were translated into everyday pedagogies and activities was brought into
sharp focus in Britain in the buildup to the U.S.-led war against Iraq.
Although the new citizenship curriculum requires schools to teach students about politically signiﬁcant current events, as well as political structures and processes, a study of
citizenship education teaching in English schools in the months before the invasion of
Iraq found that teachers “were uneasy in dealing with the issues of Iraq or of terrorism”
and “young people of all ages felt they were being sold short in terms of information and
understanding.”5 The former chief inspector of schools for England endorsed this reluctance
to engage school students in discussion about the war, arguing that
I worry a bit about encouraging young people to articulate judgements and feelings, however strongly
they are held, when they haven’t got the evidence, they haven’t got the experience to really understand
the full ramiﬁcations of what they are talking about.6
Thanks to my research assistant on this project, Julia Snell, for her diligent support. I would like to
thank all of those who collaborated on this volume for the intellectually enriching experience of working
with them.
Civic Life Online
A remarkable number of school students begged to differ and in the course of February
and March 2003 Britain experienced an unprecedented wave of strikes organized by school
students protesting against the British Government’s support for the Iraq war. Libby Brooks,
reporting for the Guardian newspaper on the protest by over a thousand school students
outside the British Parliament, observed that
These young people were organising and leading their own protests, leaﬂeting at school gates, organising email networks and expertly working the media. Their determination to be heard was
palpable.7
Other sections of the British press were less positive about these demonstrations of political
activism by young people, accusing them of not understanding the issues, being vulnerable
to manipulation by sinister political forces, and engaging in illegitimate truancy.8 Ironically,
some British newspapers blamed the citizenship curriculum for these manifestations of dissent by young people. The reality was somewhat different: as Davies notes in her study of
citizenship education, most schools failed to acknowledge, analyze or respond to the war,
leaving young people with a sense of mystiﬁcation and inefﬁcacy in relation to one of the
most consequential political events in recent British history; while those students who did
take up “new forms of involvement and action among themselves” (as recommended by
Crick) “faced disciplinary proceedings and suspensions.”9
This failure to provide a democratic response to a momentous political event raises important questions about the capacity of a government-driven curriculum to address questions
of conﬂict that potentially challenge its own power and legitimacy. It is a failure which
supports Frazer’s concern that the emphasis of the promoters of citizenship education upon
generalized notions of values, rights, and duties conceals an underlying antipathy toward
a more agonistic conception of politics.10 The argument that I propose to pursue in this
chapter is that the silence of citizenship education teachers about Iraq and the silencing
of antiwar protesters by education authorities are indicative of a more deep-rooted tension
between managed and autonomous citizenship. It is the aim of this chapter both to make
theoretical sense of this tension and to explore its practical ramiﬁcations in the context of
Two Faces of E-Citizenship
After Italy’s uniﬁcation in 1860, the Italian nationalist leader and novelist, Massimo
d’Azeglio, remarked that “we have made Italy, we now have to make Italians.” This project
was pursued by exploiting a range of information and communication technologies (ICT),
from the printing press to the mass circulation of patriotic songs. Contemporary governments seeking to promote sociocultural cohesion increasingly turn to ICT to cultivate and
regulate norms, routines, and rituals of citizenship. But this grand project of “making citizens” entails an inevitable tension between liberal and communitarian ends. From a liberal
perspective, citizens are free agents, and just civic norms are those that do not seek to impose
upon individuals’ collective notions of what is good. In contrast, the communitarian perspective places greater emphasis upon the common good than upon citizens’ self-determination,
and therefore justiﬁes policies intended to shape civic behavior at the expense of individual
agency. Any policy by government to promote civic engagement will be vulnerable to liberal
criticism that its real intention is to encourage beliefs and actions consistent with its own
values and interests, while marginalizing dissenting voices.
Doing IT for Themselves
The British government has expressed considerable enthusiasm in recent years for the idea
of promoting online political engagement, declaring that “ICT provides a means by which
public participation can be increased, and we hope that with an active government policy the
potential beneﬁts can be maximised.” The government’s policy document on e-Democracy
states that
One important target group for this policy is young people. All democratic institutions have a responsibility to ensure that young people are able to play their part. Evidence suggests that young people are
among those least likely to see the democratic process as relevant to them. Young people are also among
those most likely to be competent in ICT.11
The policy of “targeting” young people so that they can “play their part” can be read
either as a spur to youth activism or an attempt to manage it. Indeed, the very notion of
youth e-citizenship seems to be caught between divergent strategies of management and
autonomy.12 Although these two faces of e-citizenship represent ideal types, and should
perhaps be understood as opposing points on a spectrum rather than mutually exclusive
positions, they differ sufﬁciently in their contrasting conceptions of the status of young
people, the affordances of digital technologies, and the authenticity of “actually existing
democracy” to provide a useful theoretical context for assessing the projects discussed in the
next section.
Youth as Apprentices or Catalysts
It would seem on the face of it that deﬁning the status of youth would not be particularly
contentious. Freeland, for example, constructs youth as a “stage of life between childhood
and adulthood.”13 But what are the implications of this transitional status? Advocates of
managed e-citizenship regard young people as apprentice citizens who are in a process of
transition from the immaturity of childhood to the self-possession of adulthood. As apprentices, youth are in a state of dependency and becoming: to use Quovrup’s wry phrase, they
are human becomings rather than human beings. This means that they lack the powers of independent agency associated with self-determination. Civic apprenticeship entails learning
the skills required to exercise responsible judgment in a risky and complex world.
In contrast to this conception of e-citizenship as socialization, proponents of autonomous
e-citizenship refuse to see themselves as apprentice citizens, arguing that, despite their limited
experience or access to resources, they possess sufﬁciently autonomous agency to speak for
themselves on agendas of their own making. Autonomous e-citizens regard youth itself as
a reﬂexive project in which narratives of emergence, socialization, and engagement can be
renegotiated by each new generation. As Beck has argued, “The “biographization” of youth
means becoming active, struggling and designing one’s own life.”14 In this sense, not only
the objective conditions facing youth, but the subjective experience of what it means to be
a young person becomes a matter for politicized discourse.
The Internet as Anarchy or Enclave
Similarly contrasting perspectives characterize the ways in which the two faces of
e-citizenship regard the Internet as a space for civic engagement. Managed e-citizenship
starts from the assumption that the Internet, as an anarchic realm in which unknown nodes
perpetually collide, is an unsafe place for young people, not only because their social innocence might be exploited by predators but also because they are politically vulnerable to
misinformation and misdirection. For the Internet to become a useful locus of socialization,
Civic Life Online
proponents of managed e-citizenship favor the establishment of safe, civilized, moderated
enclaves in which youth can learn and have their say. As well as providing a safe environment in which young people can be heard and observed, a key objective of managed spaces
of e-citizenship is to cultivate “responsibilized” citizens (to use Garland’s term15) who are
not only free to argue but to obey the rules of good argument; who are not only taught to
be technically competent Internet users but self-regulating actors capable of surviving safely
in a virtual world replete with real and imagined dangers.
It is precisely the anarchy of the Internet that appeals to autonomous e-citizens, who see
it as a relatively free space in which untrammeled creativity and acephalous networks can
ﬂourish. With Bennett, they celebrate “the Internet’s potential as a relatively open public
sphere in which the ideas and plans of protest can be exchanged with relative ease, speed
and global scope.”16
While proponents of managed e-citizenship tend to be sanguine about the democratic
characteristics of the Internet, autonomous e-citizens express concerns about “the ways in
which citizenship norms, rights, obligations and practices are encoded in the design and
structure of our increasingly digital surroundings.”17 They question what Luke has called
the “hidden pedagogies of citizenship,”18 fearing that citizenship is being molded and constrained by technological infrastructures that are designed to perpetrate a narrow, quiescent
and consumerist model of civic action.
Democracy as Existing or Aspirational
From the perspective of managed e-citizenship, existing structures and processes of governance are essentially democratic, but are undermined by the failure of citizens to engage with
them and of elected representatives to respond to those who do take the trouble to participate. Democracy is seen as suffering from a “deﬁcit” that can be rectiﬁed by enhancing the
voices of the public and the listening skills of politicians. Youth are regarded as a neglected
social group whose political alienation from the democratic process can be addressed by
making it more genuinely accountable and consultative. As the ministerial introduction to
a cabinet ofﬁce report entitled Young People and Politics puts it,
we must all take the action necessary to raise the levels of youth participation in democracy, and the
numbers of young people who use their vote. If we say young people aren’t interested in politics and
voting, then we must strive to engage their interest. If we are to encourage them to express their opinions
at the ballot box, we must listen to what young people are telling us, and then take the right action.19
Proponents of autonomous e-citizenship are more skeptical about the claims and limits
of “actually existing democracy.” Rather than engage with the established political process,
they seek to generate new democratic networks that can circumvent established regimes
of power. These might be compared to Bey’s notion of the temporary autonomous zone,
which he describes as being “like an uprising which does not engage directly with the State,
a guerrilla operation which liberates an area (of land, of time, of imagination) and then
dissolves itself to re-form elsewhere/elsewhen, before the State can crush it.”20
The conﬂict between the two faces of e-citizenship is between a view of democracy as an
established and reasonably just system, with which young people should be encouraged to
engage, and democracy as a political as well as cultural aspiration, most likely to be realized
through networks in which young people engage with one another. As ever, strategies of
accessing, inﬂuencing, and reconﬁguring power are at the heart of what might at ﬁrst appear
to be mere differences of communicative style.
Doing IT for Themselves
Doing and Being Done For: Some Examples
Some e-citizenship projects are run for young people by adults; others are run by young people themselves. To understand this distinction, and the practical implications of managed
and autonomous youth e-citizenship, six U.K.-based projects were selected for investigation. Two of the projects are government funded, one is funded by independent charitable
foundations, and three do not receive any external funding. They are
The Hansard Society’s Headsup project ( which
describes itself as “a place where young people can debate political issues and current
affairs. But it’s not just about talking, it’s about getting something done. The debates
involve the U.K.’s top decision-makers from parliament and government who want to
understand the views and experiences of young Britain.” The project is funded by the
U.K. government’s Department of Constitutional Affairs.
The English School Students’ Association (ESSA) ( 
which “aims to provide training, guidance and advice to empower students and equip
them with the vital skills needed to become actively involved in the decision-making
processes in their own school communities; and . . . aims to work in partnership with
other organisations to bring the views of secondary school students to the attention of
local and national policy-makers, as well as the media, in relation to educational issues.”
The project is funded by charitable foundations.
The Northern Irish project, Where Is My Public Servant? (WIMPS) ( 
org.uk/), which describes itself as being “aiming to inspire and empower young people
in Northern Ireland, giving them a voice in the decisions that affect all our lives, trying
to get young people talking and inﬂuencing politicians and public representatives.” The
project is funded by the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.
The Students Against Sweatshops campaign ( 
uk/), which is “a student organisation which ﬁghts against the bosses of sweatshops
worldwide—campaigning in solidarity with the exploited workers.” The project is funded
by the activists who run it.
The George Fox 6 Campaign ( which campaigns against the criminal conviction of six students for protesting during a conference
at Lancaster University intended to promote the commercialization of research. The
project is funded by the activists who run it.
Educationet ( is a left-of-center news resource for students
that describes itself as “the number one place to discuss the issues of the day concerning
students, and of course to ﬁnd out all the NUS gossip.” The project is funded by the
activists who run it.
The study of these six projects involved extensive semistructured interviews with key actors
involved in running their online operations.21 Interviewees were encouraged to articulate the
political objectives of their projects; set out their reasons for using particular technologies
and applications; reﬂect upon the governance of their projects, with particular reference
to the regulation of online behavior; and consider the implications of having an actual or
potential relationship with government. A thematic summary of their responses is set out in
the following four sections.
Civic Life Online
Deﬁning Political Objectives
There is a conspicuous difference between the political objectives of funded and nonfunded
projects. The former exist to connect young people with powerful institutions that might
otherwise ignore them. For example, the WIMPS project, which has been remarkably imaginative and successful in stimulating youth voices to intervene in the often opaque and tribal
politics of Northern Ireland, was described as being
about young people engaging with public servants, mostly elected representatives, politicians at various
levels and the reason we felt that was important was because there isn’t a lot of engagement between
young people and politicians here. (Smyth)
Likewise, the Hansard Society’s Headsup project seeks to connect young people to parliamentarians. Described as being “a debating platform where essentially young people debate
directly on a key topic” (Grifﬁths), a key criterion for the success of the site is the willingness of MPs to participate. Indeed, Headsup’s project manager was eager to point out
that “in the last year . . . so that’s only ﬁve debates . . . we’ve actually had forty-seven MPs
take part . . . which is an average of about nine and a half per debate” (Grifﬁths). Young
people are invited to vote on topics to be debated on the Headsup forum and, once a
topic has been selected, the project manager sees it as his job to recruit politicians who are
willing to listen and interact. This recruitment involves members of parliamentary select
committees, all-party groups, and designated representatives of the main political parties.
But what about unofﬁcial voices: dissidents, the unelected, voices from excluded segments
of society? The emphasis upon being heard by powerful people seems to exclude these
counterconnections.
ESSA is also committed to connecting young people to power, but in their case it is
educational authorities that they seek to inﬂuence:
We are working to give students between 11 and 19 a voice in education, because it was the realization
that parents, teachers, governors, heads, in fact every single person in the educational sector, had
a national body and had a way of having their voice heard, but the students who are the largest
stakeholders didn’t have such a body. (Dey)
The political objective of the funded projects seems to be to engender a form of witnessing,
so that the voices of the less powerful are somehow acknowledged, respected, or even incorporated into the policy process. When asked to think about what would constitute success or
failure for their projects, these interviewees were eager to return to this theme of the quality
of democratic witnessing. For example, in the case of WIMPS, the battle seemed to be to
drag recalcitrant politicians into a communicative relationship for which they were not fully
The average age of politicians is probably well into the 50s—and that’s being generous—so what we are
saying to them is you can’t ignore this [the Internet], this is the way people communicate today. We
did have one politician who had a meeting with the WIMPS team and was being very patronizing and
saying “I don’t take e-mail seriously. People should write a letter and if their grammar is not good I won’t
respond,” but, interestingly, recently we noticed him responding to some e-mails on the site because
they came from a group of young people at a special school who were complaining about education
cutbacks and threats to their education, and I think he realized he couldn’t afford not to respond to
that. So that was really quite interesting. (Smyth)
The common claim made by interviewees was that being heard would make young people
more active citizens in the future:
Doing IT for Themselves
Research that shows if students are engaged in decision making in the schools and they feel more part
of it they are more likely to do well and not want to truant, because they feel part of the system.. . . ESSA
wants to engage youth in decision making with the view that if youth engage in decision making while
at school they are more likely to vote as a side impact. (Dey)
Politics has disengaged from young people, not the other way around—and if we don’t get that through
to politicians, then I think the democratic veneer in our society is going to get thinner and thinner and
people will become more skeptical about politics and politicians. (Smyth)
This attempt to rescue contemporary democracy from its own worst habits, by opening
it up to hitherto neglected voices, is in stark contrast to the more pessimistic views of the
political system expressed by activists within the unfunded projects:
I don’t believe there is anything like a profound commitment to democratic principles within either
government or wider society. I personally think one really big advance would be for people to simply
stop calling the political system in which we live democratic. For example, people can say activists
shouldn’t use direct action, or break laws generally, because “we live in a democracy.” They can’t say
we shouldn’t do these things because “the government is responsive to demands from the public to
stop arms deals, not go to war etc.” because people know this simply isn’t true. But with the shortcut of
“democracy” they win—any further analysis and their point gets shown up for the sham it is. (Matt)
Regardless of the merits of this anarchistic argument, it is indicative of an approach to online communication that does not regard connecting to governing institutions as a valuable
objective. Rather than tell government about perceived social injustice, the online campaign
organizer of Students Against Sweatshops emphasized the importance of her site as a means
of connecting the interests and experiences of students to those of exploited workers in other
parts of the world:
There is a recognition by students that sweatshops are a Third World issue. It appeals to the students
because they also have to work rubbish jobs, long hours for no pay and there has been a big movement,
particularly in America, linking up sweatshop work with low pay on campus work and ﬁghting for a
living wage for workers and it’s starting to take off in U.K. universities too, which we’re hoping to feed
into. (Buckland)
Rather than being witnessed by authority, the autonomous e-citizenship projects are seeking to encourage a collective consciousness of shared values:
We’ve had over two thousand people on the online petition and a lot of people contacting
us.. . . Chomsky signing the petition boosted people’s interest.. . . People from literally all over the world,
which was really very nice; people from Asia, Australasia, and South America and so on. You can still
see them online . . . all the different names, that was really inspiring. (Matt)
Both models of e-citizenship seem to regard the nature of political engagement as a form of
witnessing: for managed e-citizenship this entails being witnessed by powerful elites; for autonomous e-citizenship the point is to bear witness to one another. The notion of citizens as
witnesses is powerful, implying that democratic citizenship can only ever be realized through
mediated communication. Such a conception is consistent with recent work by Zelizer, Peters, Ellis, and Sontag, each of whom has attempted to show how witnessing entails making
the depth of original experience available to others.22 As Ellis argues, the paradoxically distanced and involving nature of witnessing “implies a necessary relationship with what is
seen.”23 An intriguing question for new media research is whether virtual communication
enhances or undermines that relationship; whether the disembodied testimonies of faceless
Civic Life Online
e-citizens can be more easily dismissed as ephemeral and ethereal or whether the force of the
network might engender acts of what one might call collective witnessing.
Using Digital Technologies
Unsurprisingly, the most ambitious plans to use digital technologies came from the funded
projects, which could better afford to invest in innovatory experimentation. For example,
WIMPS is in the process of moving from solely text-based to audio- and video-based communications between young people and Northern Irish politicians:
One of the things we’re doing is putting video on to the site, so, for example, a young person might
pop up and say “Have you thought about this issue that you are working on and who the best person
to speak to is—is this the kind of issue you might go to your MEP with?” so that there is an interaction
between the people using the site. (Smyth)
WIMPS is also setting up opportunities for young people to produce and interact with
blogs and iPods. Similarly, Headsup is “running a project in which young people can
send in pictures and texts via mobile phone to the Home Affairs Select Committee”
(Grifﬁths).
Interestingly, participants in these online projects seem not to be impressed by the more
extravagant gimmickry of digital technology. In the case of WIMPS, the young people involved were highly critical of the original designs for the Web site produced by an external
The young people kept rejecting their designs. [The Web design company] has a very young staff, not
much older than the people we were working with. They kept coming up with these sites ﬂashy with
bells and whistles on them which they thought would appeal to teenagers and we rejected about four
different designs and one of the directors rang me up and said “We can’t keep producing designs, time
is money,” so we sat the group down and talked it through and we realized was that they were trying
to tell the designers was that they wanted something serious. They wanted the site to look serious.
Preconceived notions of “what kids want” are more than likely to be mistaken. The autonomous e-citizenship sites were equally unimpressed by digital gimmicks. Indeed, they
seemed to subscribe to a fairly old-fashioned, broadcast model of how to use the Internet.
For Students Against Sweatshops, the main function of the online project is to disseminate
information:
It’s an excellent way of getting information out to lots of people. We don’t have loads of money. We
can’t afford to produce a newsletter that we send out to everyone. We can do it online basically for free
and it can be updated instantly. People from all over the world can search for it. We get a lot of people.
It’s just really useful. (Buckland)
Similarly, the George Fox 6 Campaign saw their Web site as “just another resource,” like
putting up posters or handing out leaﬂets. Interviewees from the autonomous e-citizenship
projects were very clear about the ways in which digital technologies has enabled them to
compete in a fairer communication environment.
I think that activists like ourselves are playing on a remarkably unlevel playing ﬁeld. I think the Internet
gives us something. It’s a positive thing. It gives you access to people that previously you wouldn’t have
contacted except through photocopied leaﬂets. You can be there in people’s homes and they are on the
computer and they can go to the Guardian Web site or Home Ofﬁce Web site or they can go to our Web
site, and in that sense we’re on a slightly more even footing. (Matt)
Doing IT for Themselves
The only way ESSA got where it has today is because of online communication. I wouldn’t be able to get
the word out there. Everything has happened via e-mails and newsgroups. (Dey)
Nonetheless, there was a recognition by most of the online activists that successful political
relationships cannot be entirely virtual. As one interviewee put it, “I think technology is
really effective where people already have a relationship and then they use the technology
to enhance the relationship” (Smyth).
For the autonomous e-citizenship projects, it is the capacity to move from virtual communication to more tangible networks that held out the most alluring prospects:
If you look at the kind of activism that I’m involved in, it [digital communication] has been really
beneﬁcial for the people who have been involved because they can connect more easily and they can
network within themselves more easily, which is deﬁnitely very useful . . . so I think deﬁnitely, for people
who want to work in those ways, it can be helpful. (Matt)
I think social networks are really interesting. We’ve seen sites like Bebo or Facebook and MySpace
becoming really popular amongst young people. So people do engage in these Web sites, but the question
is, will they continue doing so in a political arena? (Dey)
For the editor of Educationet, the most useful function of his site is to facilitate journalistic
networking, with him “digging up the raw material for other people to use” and “the people
who are running student campaigns getting their information from Educationet” (Jayanetti).
Regulating Discourse
Interviewees from the managed e-citizenship projects communicated a strong sense that
there is a particular way to talk about politics. Characteristics such as politeness, consensusseeking, due respect for authority and rationality are encouraged. The manager of the
Headsup project described participants in his forum as “very quick-tempered,” but “in a
constructive way, not ranting” (Grifﬁths). The manager of the WIMPS project was eager to
explain that
Speaking publicly has a different implication to speaking privately. I think the young people have really
learned that when they are putting stuff on the site—and this will be even more apparent when they
are doing audio and video—they are speaking publicly and therefore they must use language that’s
appropriate. (Smyth)
This notion of appropriate speech was intriguing because of its echoes of Foucauldian
notions of governmentality. According to Foucault, modern liberal governance is no longer
based principally upon technologies of domination and coercion, but is increasingly concerned to cultivate habits of self-regulation, through which governable subjects are produced.
The modiﬁcation of talk about power among young people who are encountering politics
for the ﬁrst time provides an excellent illustration of this governmentalist process at work.
There are three ways in which such regulation could be discerned. First, interviewees tended
to subscribe to a risk discourse that emphasized the potential dangers of unrestricted online
communication. Asked whether contributors to the Headsup debates could contact one another (perhaps to pursue a political argument or even to organize together on the basis of
agreement), the project manager explained that
It’s all done via the Web site really. They could always contact me and I’d act as a contact. But its quite
tricky because of the data protection issues. You can’t just pass people’s identities very easily. You need
to be very careful about that. (Grifﬁths)
Civic Life Online
While it is indeed the case that European data protection law is strict about the prevention
of third-party distribution of personal information, that still does not explain why young
people should not be able to contact one another directly, in the way that they surely can
in the physical world.
Second, the need for debate between young people to be moderated by a supervisory
presence was considered important:
In the initial stage it wasn’t premoderated, which means that all the comments went on straight away.
We quickly realized that the young people were very quick to cotton on to that and expose and exploit it
and post lots of dodgy messages, so it’s now premoderated, but the messages are of a really high quality
now. (Grifﬁths)
The notion of “message quality” seems on the surface to be straightforward. One assumes it
relates to messages that are reﬂective, evidential and tolerant. But these criteria are only ever
implicit within the project. Nowhere on the Headsup Web site is quality either demanded
or deﬁned. What constitutes a “dodgy” message? (Dodgy is a British term, often used to
describe improper or illicit activity.) In what ways, and with what intent, were young people
“exploiting” opportunities to express themselves in inappropriate ways? There are too many
unstated assumptions at play here to leave one sure that moderating techniques are politically
neutral or inoffensive.
The third aspect of discourse regulation was encapsulated by ofﬁcial rules posted on some
of the sites. The manager of the Headsup project was very candid about this:
I think with any online forum debate you need rules to help govern the participants really.. . . The thing
is when you’ve got the rules it’s easier to manage.. . . In my time of managing Heads-Up, which is about
nine months now, I haven’t had to refer or use any of them or say you’ve broken this rule etc. It’s like a
polite deterrent really. (Grifﬁths)
Again, this begs a question (which could perhaps have been pursued more energetically
in the interview): what exactly are these rules deterring? The “obvious” answer associates
youth with dangers of playful disruption, boundary testing, and irresponsibility. But what
seems obvious is often no more than hegemonic prejudice. Sometimes deterrents never have
to be used because they are not in reality deterring anything, but simply exist to reinforce
institutional fear and authority. ESSA also favors guidelines for the peer discussions that it
hopes to add as a key feature of its site:
I think we’d have guidelines as to what we would or would not accept. I don’t think it would be very good
if it became a ground for students to slag off each other or their teachers. That might not be very constructive and that might not be good for the site in general, so there would be guidelines about that. (Dey)
Each of these regulatory techniques raise questions about whose interests they are serving.
Do they exist to maximize the beneﬁts of democratic debate, or to promote a particular
set of ethical principles, or to satisfy risk-aversive funders? And if there is a convincing
democratic rationale for regulation, should this not be passed on to the autonomous ecitizenship projects that appear to have no guidelines regarding appropriate speech?
The Students Against Sweatshops campaign explained how they used technology to democratize decision making about appropriate content for their site:
We’ve got an e-mail list and sometimes before putting things up that might be contentious . . . we put
them out on our open e-mail list and say, “Is this okay? What do people think about it?” So we’ve got
shared editorial control over it. (Buckland)
Doing IT for Themselves
The autonomous e-citizenship projects regarded the use of open-source software as an
important principle of collaborative networking.
Relations With Government
Several interviewees expressed strong doubts about the British Government’s genuine commitment to communicating with young people. As the editor of Educationet put it,
If the government wants more young people to be politically engaged, it should spend slightly less of
its time carrying out policies that put not only young people, but pretty much all people, off having
anything to do with politics and the political process. When the politicians say in their manifesto they
will not introduce university tuition fees in the lifetime of the next parliament and then they go ahead
and introduce tuition fees in the lifetime of the next parliament, the likelihood of people engaging
positively in the way that they want them to, in terms of being good little citizens and voting and not
making too much of a fuss about anything, that’s not going to happen. What instead happens is people
don’t vote or they vote en-bloc in protest. People either disengage from the process or they get angry.
(Jayanetti)
The WIMPS project manager was unconvinced by the listening postures of government:
Every government department is creating policies which they are supposed to consult with people on
and they are sending out this gobbledegook that they want the youth workers to communicate to young
people and then give feedback to the government departments. It was all on the terms of the department.
It was mostly fairly uninteresting stuff to most people, let alone young people. But when young people
even bothered to respond, at best they were invited to meet the Minister and shake his hand, but they
were never really taken very seriously. (Smyth)
Nonetheless, government is a potential source of funding for projects that could help
to realize democratic objectives that might not receive support from elsewhere. Headsup is
funded by the Department of Constitutional Affairs, in return for which it is required to
run at least one online debate on a topic selected by the DCA. WIMPS is funded by the
Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive. To what extent are these projects constrained by
government values? According to the WIMPS project manager,
The test will come when it [WIMPS] starts to raise issues that are really quite controversial and somebody
in the government or electoral unit get a phone call saying, “Why you supporting this?” We need to be
strong and robust enough to be able to stand up to them, providing what the team has done is legitimate
and fair. So it needs to have journalistic independence. It’s quite a tricky thing to establish the funding
base that allows you do that. (Smyth)
ESSA, which has already received a good deal of moral support from people close to
government, would consider accepting ofﬁcial funding subject to one condition:
If they could give us money with no strings attached, that would be ideal, but obviously we don’t want
to become a mouthpiece for the government. We want to do our own thing. If they see the value in
what we were doing and gave us funding, that would be good. (Dey)
Other interviewees were more doubtful about the possibility of taking government money
and being allowed to criticize its actions. Asked whether they would accept money if it
came out of a government fund to encourage youth e-participation, the online organizer of
Students Against Sweatshops explained that
I’m not sure that for our campaign we would accept that sort of funding. I think if it’s a political
campaign, regardless if you use the Internet or not, there’s always the question of how much you can
Civic Life Online
be inﬂuenced by taking money of that sort. Ours isn’t just a campaign to get people engaged. There’s a
set of political objectives there. I guess we’d never come under the criteria for that. (Buckland)
The George Fox 6 Campaign was equally skeptical:
The strings that are attached, the stress that comes attached, the feeling of dependency that is created,
the feeling that you can start to self-censor—it’s a massive issue that once you’ve got money you start
to think, “Am I going to piss these people off if we don’t give them exactly what they want?” (Matt)
For WIMPS, the best way for government to avoid being seen as inauthentic and disingenuous in its commitment to e-participation is to support grassroots projects that are run by
and accountable to young people:
The government coming out and saying we want young people to participate will probably put off
signiﬁcant numbers of the very young people that they want to reach. I think the success of WIMPS,
to the extent that it’s been successful so far, is that it’s not a government site. It may have government
funding, but it’s most deﬁnitely not a government site. It’s run by young people and I think young
people coming on to it very quickly get a sense of that. (Smyth)
The editor of Educationet is less convinced by the British Government’s recent enthusiasm
for e-participation:
There hasn’t been a fall in voter turnout because there aren’t enough Web sites encouraging young
people to get politically active.. . . We’re coming from a period where there was no Internet. I don’t vote
because the parties are rubbish. I personally feel that they are going to go to Parliament to lie their
backsides off—and that’s based on experience. (Jayanee)
The relationship between government and the projects considered here seems to be problematic on two levels. From a pragmatic perspective, project organizers have to decide
whether they can trust the government to support the principle of political engagement
without seeking to manage it in practice. From a more overtly political perspective, there is
the question of whether government is the provider of solutions or the cause of problems in
relation to the atrophy of democratic engagement. If, as some of the interviewees argued, it
is the performance—perhaps even the most basic institutional values—of governments (of
various types and colors) that cause young people to turn away from politics, one might
conclude that a more constructive role for them would be to provide resources for grassroots
activists to use without political interference.
Supporting Youth E-Citizenship: Some Policy Proposals
The purpose of policy is to connect effective means to desired ends. Before arriving at strategic
conclusions, there remains a need for clarity about the broader political objectives of youth
e-citizenship. What exactly is it that the projects we have examined, and many others like
them, are seeking to accomplish? As we have already seen, e-citizenship projects tend to fall
into two categories. Those that have received external funding, from government bodies or
charitable foundations, tend to be mainly interested in establishing “connections” between
young people and institutions which have some power over their lives. Regarding youth as
apprentice citizens who need to learn appropriate ways of engaging with encrusted structures
of governance, they seek to promote habits of civility, while at the same time encouraging
young people to think of themselves as empowered social actors whose (virtual) voices deserve to be heard. Autonomous e-citizenship projects tend not to be funded by government,
Doing IT for Themselves
and express strong reservations about having too close a relationship with the state. These
projects are less interested in engaging with powerful institutions than in forming powerful
networks of young people, engaged with one another to resist the power of institutions.
Regarding youth as independent political agents, autonomous e-citizens expect less from the
communicative potential of having their say; for them, empowerment entails an intimate
relationship between voice and action.
Both of these approaches are open to critique. Managed e-citizenship can be criticized for
promoting mainly vertical and bilateral communicative relationships between young people
and power elites; for failing (often on spurious grounds of “risk”) to facilitate horizontal
networks in which young people cannot merely express themselves as individuals, but enter
into collective activities; for circumscribing agendas of political debate, such as the neurotic
avoidance of “sensitive issues” or any acknowledgement that most political debate is in
reality of a partisan nature; and for placing too much emphasis upon talk and being heard and
showing too little concern for the consequences of democratic expression and the capacity of
organized opinion to inﬂuence political outcomes. Indeed, some might argue that managed
e-citizenship, with its overriding interest in friendliness, deliberation and consensus, provides
young people with a highly distorted simulation of the political world: a virtual community
of well-trained democrats who would be lost in any real political party, trade union, or local
Critics of autonomous e-citizenship might point to its dislocation from structures and
processes of effective power; its tendency to preach to the converted and to pay little attention to reaching opposed minds or entering into any kind of deliberative debate with
the undecided; its emphasis upon single issues, at the expense of more generalized values
or aggregated positions; and its reliance upon digital technologies that are encoded in ways
that are bound to undermine its efforts.
I do not propose to conclude by subscribing to one or the other of these two approaches
to e-citizenship. Rather than perpetuate this dichotomy, I intend to argue that there is a
strong case for breaching this divide and seeking a productive convergence between these
two models of youth e-citizenship. But before turning to such a creative policy synthesis,
there is a little more theoretical work to be done, for, although we have distinguished
the characteristics of managed and autonomous e-citizenship, we have yet to arrive at a
satisfactory answer to the question, What is e-citizenship supposed to accomplish?
Following Foucauldian political theorists, such as Rose, Barry, and Cruickshank,24 I want to
characterize e-citizenship as a technology of governance. That is not to say that e-citizenship
is about governing young people, in the traditionally coercive and dominating sense, but
that it is about nurturing forms of conduct consistent with being a citizen. The function
of e-citizenship is to conceive, create and sustain members of a political community. The
emphasis upon membership is important, because, as citizens, young people are being invited
into a community; they are being offered membership cards (IDs, passports); they are required
to accept both rules and sanctions (law, morality; ﬁnes and prisons); they are urged to
consider their responsibilities as well as rights as members; and they are expected to have
regard for the speciﬁc nature of their community (Northern Ireland versus Ireland; Canada
versus the U.S.A.; Iran versus Iraq). Members of a police force, an army, a football team or a
dance troupe are expected to be trained. So are citizens. To be a nonmember of a community
is to be a stranger, faced with all the risks and vulnerabilities of the outsider. But to be an
insider carries with it sometimes onerous burdens. It is to prepare young people for these rites
and rights of membership that e-citizenship, as one technology among others, is employed.
Civic Life Online
But the terms of citizenship are not static. A second function of e-citizenship is to contest
those terms. Some of the projects examined above manifested a largely uncritical view of
what it means to be a citizen in a contemporary liberal democracy, such as the United
Kingdom. They operated on the basis that parliament represents the people; that voting
is a key way of holding power to account; that the expression of public opinion is a key
means of inﬂuencing policy; that the discussion of politics is best undertaken without the
interference of partisan or class loyalties; that civil behavior entails particular norms and that
uncivil behavior should be regulated. These assumptions reﬂect the values to be found in
most textbooks on citizenship education. They do not emerge out of a sinister conspiracy to
maintain the status quo, but neither to they encourage young people to think for themselves
about the kind of democracy they want, at least until they have been socialized into the basic
routines of the existing format. Other projects examined above tended to stretch the notion
of citizenship beyond its textbook deﬁnition. For example, the George Fox 6 Campaign
insisted that broadly conceived rights to protest against injustice should be protected for all
members of any community; Students Against Sweatshops seek to extend rights of citizenship
in two ways: by adding an economic dimension to them and by calling for such rights to be
granted to “strangers” in the Third World whose exploitation is in some sense linked to that
of students in the West.
Technologies of e-citizenship turn cyberspace into a locus for the contestation of claims
about citizenship. Because entry into the virtual public sphere is cheaper and less burdensome
than making one’s presence felt in the conventional public sphere, it is particularly attractive
to young people whose experiences and aspirations might otherwise be marginalized or
forgotten. The inclusion of these voices and traditions in the development of e-citizenship is
of the utmost importance, if there is a genuine commitment to cultivate a democratic culture
of participation. This is the key policy question for governments: are they in favor of merely
promoting participation on their own terms or are they prepared to commit to a policy of
democratic participation? The latter will always be slightly uncomfortable for governments.
Democracy should be disruptive to people in power. Why else would it be so cherished by
the relatively powerless?
How, then, might a productive convergence between managed and autonomous ecitizenship be realized? The ﬁrst stage entails combining in one policy the strongest democratic features of both models. A government wishing to promote democratic youth ecitizenship might start out, therefore, by signing up to the following six principles:
Government is willing to fund, but not directly manage or interfere with, common
online spaces in which young people are free to express themselves as citizens, and
about the terms of citizenship.
Online democratic spaces for young people shall include horizontal channels of interaction, through which networks and collective associations can be formed, as well as
vertical channels, providing dialogical links to various institutions that have power and
authority over them.
It is up to young people to set the terms of their own political debate, without any
external censorship.
E-citizenship involves both free expression and consequential political engagement.
Young people are not to be expected to participate unless the scope and terms of their
inﬂuence is explicitly outlined.
Doing IT for Themselves
Among other aspects of e-citizenship, opportunities and resources will be provided to
ensure that young people encounter others with whom they might disagree strongly,
within various kinds of deliberative settings.
Young people are encouraged to mobilize online to counter social injustices and broaden
the political agenda in any way that they see ﬁt.
While the adoption of such principles would be promising, from a broadly democratic
perspective, it should be acknowledged that they merely synthesize the strongest democratic
elements of the two currently dominant models of youth e-citizenship. But policy is not only
constructed out of what people are already doing. Both current models of youth e-citizenship
can be accused of failing to transcend the historic limits that might be referred to as analog
citizenship.
In speaking of analog citizenship, I have in mind three broad limitations. The ﬁrst concerns
ways of deﬁning what is political. There is a curious similarity in the ways that both managed and autonomous e-citizenship projects conceive the political sphere. Whether as civic
apprentices or emergent activists, participants in these projects are mainly concerned with
traditional questions of power: being heard by those in authority; seeking the introduction of
just policies; facilitating forms of collective action. None of these political approaches are by
any means obsolete, but there are strong reasons for thinking that we are in a period of profound turbulence for the political sphere, in which hitherto neglected and affective concerns
about identity, personal relationships, and domestic space are invading areas of thought and
practice once occupied by instrumental and institutional political rationalism. The excellent
chapter in this volume by Earl and Schussman raises important questions about the porous
boundary between public affairs and private pleasures. The political is rooted in everyday
life and participatory practices are increasingly regarded as forms of shared experience rather
than mere aggregations of atomized interests. Democracy, which has often seemed to be
anesthetized by constitutionality, is rooted in expressive, cathartic, and carnivalesque practices that connect public policy to mundane culture. But the e-citizenship projects we have
explored tend to be characterized by an earnest solemnity: a language and aesthetic that
allows little room for the banal sociability and cathartic frivolity that has contributed to the
success of some of the most culturally radical social movements in the history of democracy.
By emphasizing rational deliberation, at one end of the spectrum, and collective solidarity,
at the other, the promoters of e-citizenship are in danger of perpetuating forms of symbolic
exclusion that have over the years led many young people to conclude that these institutional arrangements, this language of ideology and policy, these battles of winners and losers
are not for us.
A second limitation of the analog model of e-citizenship concerns the nature and use of
digital technologies. Since the early twentieth century, political communication has been
dominated by the broadcasting paradigm in which organized centers transmit messages
to mass audiences. In the early days of the publicly available Internet many politicians
saw what they thought was their chance to become their own broadcasters, preaching to
the public without bothersome interference from journalists. In reality, the Internet has
always been much more than a broadcasting medium. Yet the projects we have investigated
are remarkably unadventurous in their approaches to many-to-many communication. For
some, this potential was overwhelmed by an excessive sense of youth at risk; for others—
even those seeking radical objectives—the most valuable use they felt they could make of
digital technologies was to disseminate truth (or countertruth) more effectively than by any

other means. Digital technologies are good for more than the dissemination of neglected
messages. The most innovative opportunities for political activity online involve speciﬁcally
digital relationships to content, such as sampling, remixing, and social collaborations ranging
from recommender systems to wikis.
Third, there has been a conspicuous absence in most of these youth e-citizenship projects
to address key questions about what it means to be a youth. If, as Giddens, Beck, and others
argue, life stages are increasingly encountered as reﬂexive projects, in which identities are
constructed at least to some extent knowingly, why is there so little discussion of these
choices and dilemmas within e-citizenship projects? Why do so few online “youth” projects
challenge social deﬁnitions of childhood, adulthood, and transitions to maturity?
Transcending these limitations could entail the adoption of three further policy principles:
While e-citizenship embraces traditional questions of power, inequality, organization,
and ideology, it does not exclude everyday political experience, such as the negotiation
of feelings and sensitivities, the governance of spaces and relationships, and the many
intersections between popular culture and power that affect life and lifestyle.
Young people are urged to use digital technologies innovatively with a view to utilizing
and expanding their democratic features. (The chapters in this volume by Bers, Levine,
and Rheingold offer some stimulating proposals in this regard.)
It is within the scope of youth e-citizenship to raise challenging questions about the nature and political status of children, adults, and youth, and to challenge condescending
or stereotypical notions of youth identity.
We are coming closer to a coherent policy for youth e-citizenship, but still there is a major
problem with the policy process to be addressed.
Thinking Democratically about Democracy: An Adventure in Policy Making
When governing institutions come to think about extending participatory democracy, it is
remarkable how rarely they consult people about how they want to participate. The result
is often a confused effort, in which policy makers decide how ordinary citizens should use
their energies and citizens refuse to join in because they would rather be using their energies
in other democratic ways. With policies for youth, there is all too often an even more
profound dislocation between policy and public demand, for many young people do not yet
have the vote, and therefore do not ﬁgure on politicians’ radar screens, and those who do
often speak a democratic language that does not easily translate into bureaucratic rationality.
Ironically, therefore, much of the current emphasis by governments upon “giving the kids
a say” amounts to little more than acting upon hunches about what will keep young people
If youth e-citizenship is to be more than a top-down exercise in bureaucratic management,
a tenth policy principle needs to be added to complete this proposal:
All e-citizenship policy will be determined in partnership between ofﬁcial policy makers
and young people themselves, using wikis and other forms of collaborative decisionmaking software.
The transition from an analog to a digital vision of youth e-engagement entails more than
enthusiasm for the technocratic future. It calls for conﬁdence in the self-determining ethos
Doing IT for Themselves
of what Lance Bennett has called “actualizing citizens” (chapter 1) and what I have referred
to as “autonomous citizenship.” It calls for a democracy in which citizenship is not merely
inherited as found, but made through creative experience. It calls, most immediately, for
an inclusive, transparent, global debate about how the digital mediasphere is reshaping the
expectations, desires, responsibilities, and prospects of young people in democratic societies.

one might argue that managed citizenship tends to produce DCs and autonomous citizenship tends to
produce ACs. One of the fruitful outcomes of collaborating on this volume is our intention to work
further on exploring the theoretical and empirical connections between these concepts.
