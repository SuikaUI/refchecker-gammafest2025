ncRNA–protein interactions for correct transcriptional
regulation has been demonstrated (14–19), suggesting
wide-ranging effects of ncRNA–protein interaction. In
addition to targeting or being targeted by proteins or
protein-coding transcripts, ncRNAs could also potentially
target other ncRNAs, resulting in a layer of regulatory
interactions between noncoding RNA classes (11,20).
Consequently, cataloguing interactions of ncRNAs and
other biomolecules is signiﬁcant for gaining insight into
biological processes and understanding the mechanism by
which ncRNAs carry out their regulatory function.
Given the importance of ncRNA interactions in various
pathways, we embarked on a project to build a comprehensive catalogue of such data and established the
NPInter database (21). A large amount of new research
has led to deeper insight into ncRNA interactions at a
variety of levels; thus, NPInter has been updated to v2.0
to accommodate for such expanding data resources.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANNOTATION
Based on the ﬁrst version of NPInter database, new
datasets from literature and other related databases were
collected. In this update, data from literature accounts for
the major source. We ﬁrst retrieved literature published in
the last 5 years from PubMed, employing key words
including ‘CLIP interaction’, ‘non-coding RNA bind
post-transcriptional’,
interaction’,
‘lncRNA protein interaction’, ‘lncRNA bind’, ‘RNA
protein cross linking’, ‘RIP non-coding RNA’, etc, and
found 1270 relevant articles. Information on reported
interactions, either veriﬁed by experiments or derived
sequencing,
manually extracted. For the latter, we only extracted processed data by authors, rather than raw sequencing data.
Binding sites were ﬁrst compared with RefSeq coding genes
to eliminate those located within coding regions and
then screened against NONCODE, which serves as an
ncRNA reference database. Binding sites that lie within
discarded.
interaction partners, proteins, protein-coding RNAs and
DNA were assigned UniProt IDs, RefSeq IDs and
UniGene IDs, respectively, while other noncoding RNAs
and DNA were still assigned NONCODE IDs or miRBase
IDs. We also integrated data from external resources,
mainly LncRNADisease (27), which curated 478 experimentally
interactions
levels, including binding, regulation and co-expression.
Molecules from LncRNADisease were subjected to the
same annotation pipeline. By manual curation on data
from literature and integration of data from LncRNA
Disease, NPInter v2.0 provides a multilevel snapshot of
the interactome. A process of redundancy elimination
was then performed on the whole dataset, including previously existing data and newly collected data as mentioned
above. Redundant interactions were aggregated into a
single record. The workﬂow used for the generation of
NPInter is schematically shown in Figure 1.

interactions from six model organisms. NPInter v2.0 presently contains 201 107 ncRNA interactions distributed
on 18 organisms, collected from 529 published articles.
The signiﬁcant growth in the amount of data is primarily
because of systematic identiﬁcation of protein binding
sites on the transcriptome through a combination of
CLIP and RNA sequencing, whereas other interactions,
including ncRNA–RNA interactions and transcript factor
(TF)–ncRNA interactions, were obtained mainly from
interaction studies on individual ncRNA.
The basic information on each interaction contains an
interaction ID, name of ncRNA and its interaction
partner, organism in which the interaction was identiﬁed,
level and class of interaction manually deﬁned in NPInter,
as well as tags manually added. The interaction partners
can be DNA, RNA or protein. For example, at the
binding level, which accounts for most of the NPInter
ncRNAs may
interact with
ncRNA (29), miRNA (30), mRNA (31) and protein
(32). At the level of indirect interactions, ncRNAs may
either regulate or be regulated by an interaction partner
(33,34). The level of interaction deﬁned in NPInter represents the types of interacting molecules and characteristics
of the interaction, including ‘RNA–protein’, ‘RNA–RNA’
interactions into three classes, which are ‘binding’, ‘regulatory’ and ‘co-expression’. Tags are added to give brief
introductions to each interaction, suggesting in which
biological process the interaction participates. Our tags
‘expression
correlation’,
interaction’,
‘genomic location related’, ‘indirect’, ‘miRNA’, ‘miRNA
target interaction’, ‘ncRNA affects synthesis or function
regulated’,
‘ncRNA–protein
binding’, ‘expression, processing, or function of ncRNA
is affected’, ‘ncRNA targets mRNA’, ‘other linkages’,
‘promoter as action site’, ‘regulatory’ and ‘RNA–RNA
interaction’. Each interaction can be labelled simultaneously with several tags. (See Supplementary Data:
Supplementary I).
The NPInter database is composed of three linked tables:
. The Interaction table gives a description of details of
the interaction between two molecules. For example,
for the interaction between Kcnq1ot1 and Dnmt1 in
mouse, information in this table states that this interaction occurs at the level of ‘RNA–protein’ and is
classiﬁed into ‘binding’ class with a tag ‘ncRNA–
protein binding’.
. The Molecule table describes information on interacting molecules, containing identiﬁers from UniGene,

The initial placement of the nodes is determined by a ‘force-directed’ layout algorithm that aims to keep the more similar nodes closer together, but
the placement may later be adjusted by the user.

the name, aliases and description of each molecule in

references in the interaction table. Each record in the
table includes the MEDLINE standard article code
(PMID) as well as general publication information.
DATA ACCESS AND VISUALIZATION
NPInter allows users to browse interactions by species,
ncRNA classes or interaction tags. Users can also query
the database through the Search interface, using the name
or aliases of molecules, molecule IDs or any other descriptive words. The whole datasets of NPInter can be directly
downloaded from the webpage, and the results of each
search can be exported. In the updated version of the
database, we have also integrated the online BLAST
service (NCBI wwwBLAST version 2.2.17), which allows
sequence similarity searches for both nucleotide and
peptide to be run on NPInter entries. Importantly, for a
noncoding RNA with no recognized name or identiﬁed
function, it is also possible to search its potential interactions with other molecules in NPInter simply based on
its sequence. Additionally, NPInter also offers a graphbased visualization of interactions (Figure 2). In the
visualization graph, each molecule is a node and interactions between molecules are designated as edges. Red
nodes represent proteins or protein-coding RNAs and
DNA, while blue and pink nodes represent ncRNAs and
miRNAs, respectively. Information of each molecule can
be checked in a new window by clicking on the corresponding node. The colour of the edges discriminates the
source of each interaction, green suggesting the interaction
is from NPInter and purple suggesting the interaction
is from STRING (35). The location of the nodes is
determined by the ForceDirected layout algorithm as
implemented in Cytoscape Web (36). The graph can be
opened in the stand-alone webpage to produce high resolution images in which size, colour and location of nodes
and edges can be adjusted. To maintain an up-to-date and
comprehensive resource, we encourage users to submit
newly published ncRNA interactions, with PubMed accession numbers required.
CONCLUSION
Noncoding RNAs have emerged as key molecular players
in different
biological
(37). Characterizing
ncRNA interactions will largely contribute towards the
discovery of novel ncRNA functions. However, existing
databases are not enough to provide a comprehensive
resource for such a purpose. For example, starBase (38)
lists all binding sites of several proteins in the transcriptome, but there is no speciﬁc annotation for noncoding
transcripts. For another example, NPIDB (39) focuses
on nucleic acid–protein complexes from PDB, thus, most
RNAs included are either rRNAs or tRNAs.
In contrast, NPInter is more informative on ncRNA
interactions
databases,
integrating interactions of the other types of ncRNAs
that serve a variety of functions. In other words,
NPInter is one of the most comprehensive databases of
interactions between ncRNAs and other biomolecules.
Compared with the previous version of NPInter, the
new version is a step towards a more integrated knowledge
database. The total number of functional interactions
of ncRNAs has been expanded. NPInter v2.0 is also
developed to present graphical molecular interaction
networks that will enable biological scientists to explore
their data in a more systems-oriented manner. NPInter
will continue to keep track of and promptly collect new
interactions.
whenever there is an accumulation of novel ncRNA interactions reported in literature or other sources.
It is worth mentioning that NPInter is included in our
systematic platform for noncoding RNAs. Our platform
consists of ncRNA resources such as NONCODE and
NPInter, as well as online tools and web servers (40–43)
including CNCI (40) and ncFANs (43) for analysis of
ncRNAs. As a member of the union of speciﬁc databases
and tools for noncoding RNAs, NPInter is expected to
remain an informative and valuable data source on the
biological roles of ncRNAs for the scientiﬁc community.
