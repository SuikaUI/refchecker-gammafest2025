Abstract-Human
observers fixated the center of a search array and were required to discriminate the
color of an odd target if it was present. The array consisted of horizontal or vertical black or white bars.
In the simple case, only orientation was necessary to define the odd target, whereas in the conjunctive
case, both orientation and color were necessary. A cue located at the critical target position was either
visible all the time (sustained cuing) or it appeared at a short variable delay before the array presentation
(transient cuing). Sustained visual cuing enhanced perception greatly in the conjunctive, but not in the
simple condition. Perception of the odd target in the conjunctive display was improved even further by
transient cuing, and peak discrimination performance occurred if the cue preceded the target array by
70-150 msec. Longer delays led to a marked downturn in performance. Control experiments indicated that
this transient attentional component was independent of the observers’ prior knowledge of target position
and was not subject to voluntary control. We provide evidence to suggest that the transient component
does not originate at the earliest stages of visual processing, since it could not be extended in duration
by flickering the cue, nor did it require a local sensory transient to trigger its onset. Neither the variation
in retinal eccentricity nor changing the paradigm to a vernier acuity task altered the basic pattern of results.
Our findings indicate the existence of a sustained and a transient component
of attention, and we
hypothesize that of the two, the transient component is operative at an earlier stage of visual cortical
processing.

INTRODUCTION
Recent neurophysiological
work in alert pri-
mates indicates that the response properties
of single cells in various cortical areas depend
on task-related
and the animal’s
attention.
For example, cells in areas V4 and
IT show a different

to a particular
of the visual
 . The receptive fields in area
V4 are larger than those in area VI and were
shown to shrink down to a very small region,

neurons in the parietal cortex and thalamus are
also influenced by the attentive
state of the
monkey . Little or
no such effects, however, are seen in striate
cortex .
These neurophysiological
results parallel the
fact that human observers can direct their visual
attention to particular regions of the visual field
without foveation.
As is often the case with
significant visual phenomena, Helmholtz (1896)
made some of the primary observations:
“The electrical discharge illuminated the printed
page for a brief moment
during which the
image of the sheet became visible and persisted
as a positive afterimage
for a short while.
Hence, perception of the image was limited to
the duration of the after-image. Eye movements
of measurable
size could not be performed
during the duration of the flash and even those
during the short persistence of the
after-image could not shift its location on the
retina. Nonetheless,
I found myself able to
choose in advance which part of the dark field
off to the side of the constantly fixated pinhole
I wanted to perceive by indirect vision. Conse-
quently, during the electrical illumination, I in
fact perceived several groups of letters in that
region of the field . . . . The letters in most of the
remaining part of the field, however, had not

The targets were presented on a CRT screen,
driven by a micro-computer
(Commodore 64 or
Amiga 1000). The frame rate was 60 Hz (non-
interlaced) and the luminance of the gray back-
ground was in the photopic range (150 cd/m’).
The observers were provided with a fixation
mark and unless noted were asked to maintain
fixation there.
Although we were confident that our trained
observers were able to maintain proper fixation,
we monitored eye movements during the collec-
tion of critical sets of data, where involuntary
lapses of fixation could jeopardize the validity of
the results. For this purpose we used a differen-
reflection
Adams, Jampolsky & Muegge, 1977) capable of
measuring horizontal
eye movements with an
accuracy of 4 min arc. Its output was digitized at
60 Hz and monitored on-line by the computer
running the experiment. A calibration
requiring that the observer make repeated fixa-
tions on 3 standard targets preceded every block
of 20 trials. Our computerized
procedure was
designed to reject responses that were preceded
or accompanied by eye movements greater than
24 min arc in either horizontal direction. Note
that this constitutes approximately
half the dis-
tance to the target nearest to the fixation mark
for Expts 1 and 2 and even a smaller proportion
for some of the other experiments.
feedback informed the observer when a trial had
been rejected. A bite bar was used to stabilize
head position.
Although not specifically designed to monitor
vertical eye movements,
our system was also
quite sensitive to the lid movements normally
associated with them. It was empirically deter-
mined that a pure vertical eye movement
45 min arc could trigger the computer’s
rejection routine. Thus, the system could assure
fixation within an elliptical window of approx.
50 x 90 min arc (H x V).
We used 7 subjects, 1747 years of age with
varying degrees of experience in visual percep-
tion and performance tasks. Not all of them did
all the experiments reported here. We will indi-

tion of each experiment. All subjects, however,
had at least 4 hr of practice comprising 3000

with the data shown in Fig. 4, which indicates

tion as instructed.

no special advantage to be gained by foveation
in our task and that attention can be directed to
the various peripheral loci in the display with
essentially equal ease.
Experiment 2: observers can attend to a blank
region without a cue
The results reported so far prompted us to ask
the cuing stimulus itself was really
necessary. Is it possible, for example, to direct
one’s attention to a “blank” region at a specific
peripheral location before the array is presented
without making eye movements while obtaining
the same enhancement
in perception?
is very similar to the observation
originally
reported by Helmholtz
(1896, see above). To
answer the question, we ran three observers
using the conjunctive paradigm. The experiment
was the same as the cuing experiment described
above, except that the cue was absent. The
observer was simply told that the target would
appear at exactly the same locus in all trials. The
observer had the task of maintaining
fixation yet directing his or her attention to a
blank unmarked region of the visual field and
waiting for the target array to appear. Paying
attention to this peripheral “blank” locus was
not easy, requiring considerable concentration.
One observer (NW) found the task too demand-
ing and could not participate in the experiment.
The two other subjects found they could do the
task and their measured performance was com-
parable to the case where a cue was present.
The functions defined by the open symbols in
Fig. 5 indicate that performance rises steeply as
duration is increased when the target position is
known and constant,
whereas the functions
defined by the closed symbols indicate that it
rises only slowly if it is unknown and variable.
It should be noted that the data in Fig. 5 for

procedure described above, so we
are confident that the improvement
in perfor-
mance cannot be attributed
to lapses in eye
Discussion of Experiments 1 and 2
In the experiments described above, we pre-
sented the observer with two discrimination
tasks in a 64 element search array. In the simple
case, the observer had to report whether an odd
target (defined by orientation alone) was present
and, if so, to report its color. In the conjunctive
case he had to report whether an odd target
KEN NAKAYAMA and MANFRED MACKEBEN
(defined by orientation and color) was present
and to report its color. We found that the
experimental manipuiation of selective attention
could improve performance only in the conjunc-
tive paradigm.
Shaw suggested that attention can only
be demonstrated for discrimination and not for
detection experiments. In Shaw’s analysis, de-
tection was equivalent to the detection of a light
flash and discrimination involved a more com-
plex digit distinction. In our case, both tasks are
discrimination
tasks, yet because of the ease
with which targets can be discerned
simple case, cue or no cue, it behaves more
similarly to Shaw’s detection task.
emphasizing
the distinction
between detection and discrimination, we think
that our results as well as Shaw’s can be reason-
ably well accounted
for by appealing
feature differencing concept or, more
precisely, to a similarity vetoing mechanism
which inhibits the responses to features which
are presented more than once in an extended
portion of the visuai field. Here, a simple feature
presented alone in a field elicits a response, but
two such identical features in a field do not. The
basic property
of such a hypothetical
mechanism would be to abolish the response to
a feature presented to a cell’s receptive field
center if the same feature is present anywhere in
the surround. For example, Frost, Scilley, and
Wong (I 98 1) have shown that the response of a
cell responding to movement of a small spot in
the receptive field center can be vetoed when
another spot is moving in the same direction in
a very large surrounding field . The existence of such mecha-
nisms means that a single odd target location
can be “marked” in the simple case; whereas, no
site will be marked in the conjunctive
Similar vetoeing mechanisms
have been ob-
served for motion in area MT , and for orientation
area 18 of the cat .
It is hypothesized that such a mechanism will
enable a unique feature in an array to have
salience by providing a single odd target with its
own “cuing” signal.
In summary,
our findings with sustained
cuing clarify the issue as to why, under some
experimental
circumstances,
focal attention
easily seen, whereas in others it is not. Atten-
tional differences will be evident only in stimulus
displays where attention
is not automatically
and uniquely drawn to the target. As such, an
added cue will do little to increase performance
when a single transient stimulus appears in an
otherwise blank field . Nor does a cue help in our
“simple” case (left side of Fig. 4) because the
target by itself can be singled out and marked by
the pre-attentive
system; the addition of a cue
can add little to target visibility. It is only when
the target does not act as its own cue, as in the
conjunctive case, that the cue can be of benefit.
Similar conclusions
can be drawn from the
experimental
findings of Bergen and Julesz
 where they compared visual search per-
formance for targets differing from distracters
with various differences in line orientation.
II: TRANSIENTLY
So far we have presented evidence that atten-
tion can be focused on a given region of the
visual field if the observer has knowledge as to
where the target will appear. In this section, we
modify our experimental paradigm to investi-
gate the temporal aspect of summoned atten-
tion, asking how long it takes for attention to be
drawn to any particular site if a cue is presented
The basic experiment is very similar to those
described in Expts 1 and 2 except that instead
of the cue remaining on for long periods of time
during the intertrial interval, it is present just
transiently
before and during the trial. The
paradigm is summarized schematically in Fig. 6
showing the sequence of visual “frames.” The
observer is presented with a fixation mark, then
a cue appears,
and after a defined interval
(designated as the “cue lead time”) the target
appears for a given duration, and finally, this is
followed by the mask (250 msec duration). Note
that the cue always remains on during the
presentation
of the stimulus array. As atten-
tional effects could only be seen using the
conjunctive display (as shown in Fig. l), this
was employed in all remaining studies to be
(with the exception

Initially all subjects had considerable

with sustained cueing, respectively.
Experiment 3: a transient component of attention
We started by varying cue lead time and
measured performance
curves for 3 different
stimulus durations
(see Fig. 7). The stimulus
array consisted of the same 64 elements em-
ployed in Expts 1 and 2. In this experiment, the
cue could be presented at any of the 64 loca-
tions, which varied from trial to trial. The cue
lead time is plotted on the abscissa and the
curves represent
the percentage
correct responses at stimulus durations of 33, 83
and 117 msec. The overall level of performance
is better for long stimulus durations than for
short ones, clearly the 117 msec performance
curve is best and the 33 msec curve is worst. This
relationship is not surprising and is consistent
with the earlier data shown in Fig. 4 which
that performance
with increasing stimulus duration. Important to
note, however, is the general course of each time
function. It shows that performance varies dra-
matically depending on the cue lead time. The
common feature of all three functions is the
monotonic rise in performance
during the first
50 msec. This consistent rise indicates that the
summoning of attention takes time and that it
takes at least 50 msec to reach optimal perfor-
mance in this situation
no matter what the
duration of the search array.
KEI-J NAKAYAMA and MANFRED MACKEBEN
The most striking aspect of the data, however,
is the fall-off in performance
when the cue
lead times were greater than 200 msec, which
occured in the two cases where the stimulus
durations were relatively short (lower curves in
Fig. 7). Not only is this fall-off apparent in the
data, it is also readily apparent to the observer.
From a phenomenological
point of view, targets
presented at the longer cue lead times are seen as
much more indistinct in comparison to targets
at the optimal cue lead times. This result came
as a surprise to us since it would seem that the
observer has the same information as to cue pos-
ition 200 msec after cue onset as he does 80 msec
aftercueonset.Yetclearerperceptionof
the target
is apparent and good performance
is obtained
only at a range of optimal cue lead times.
Experiment
4: more eye movement
Figure 8 shows the results of NW (open
symbols: with eye movement monitoring, filled
symbols: without eye movement monitoring).
Although there are some differences in perfor-
mance levels for cue lead times greater than
100 msec, the basic qualitative pattern remains:
the rise and fall of performance with increasing
cue lead times is prominent in both cases. The
same was true for the other subject in this
experiment.
The rise and fall in performance happens over
a very short span of time so that it seems highly
unlikely that eye movements could account for
any of the data at cue lead times of less than
150 msec because ordinary saccadic latencies are
generally in the range of 200-220 msec. At cue
lead times longer than saccadic latencies, how-
ever, the performance curves decline, although
eye movements would tend to keep them up by
improving discrimination. Thus, it is difficult to
see how the presence of eye movements could
have any effect on the shape of the curves seen
in Fig. 7. Nevertheless.
just to be sure, we
conducted a pair of experiments on two observ-
ers where eye movements were monitored.
Experiment
5: effect of retinal eccentricity
The same down-turn
in performance
longer cue lead times can be seen consistently in
a parametric study where we asked the question:
is this summoning of attention affected by the
distance of the target from the fixation mark?
We conducted
several sets of experiments,

array, possible problems associated with differ-
ential visual acuity and contrast sensitivity for
different retinal eccentricities were minimized.
In the first set of experiments we ran 4 observers
and 3 separate series employing circles with
radii of 2, 4 and 6”. In every other respect, the
situation was the same as described in Expt 3
and the performance vs cue lead time functions
are also similar. Data for two observers are
shown in Fig. 9.
Note that the 3 curves for each observer are
qualitatively very similar, showing a steep rise in
performance as the cue lead time increases up to
about 50 msec. Also notable is the clear drop in
performance
for longer cue lead times at all 3
eccentricities.
One additional aspect of the experiment de-
serves comment. In the experiment using the 2”
annulus, the size of the individual targets was
small, subtending only 0.15’ with a 1.26” inter-
target spacing. This seemed like a small region
within which to direct focal visual attention, as
attentional
“spotlight” is approx. 1 ’ in diameter .
To press this issue, we diminished the angular
extent of the annulus by increasing the viewing
distance even more. The question was whether
attention can be confined to the locus of closely
spaced targets which are just resolvable and
which are within the foveola, the center of the
fovea. Here we used annuli with radii of 0.13,
0.25, 0.5, and 1’ respectively, such that for the
smallest annulus, the inter-target
spacing was
0.09’ or 5 min arc and the targets subtended
only 2.5 min arc.

from replicating the transient improvement
performance,
the data using the annulus with
the smallest eccentricities indicate that this at-
tentional enhancement can be confined to a tiny
region in the visual field. In the most extreme
case, attention appears to be confined to a small
section of the fovea. Such conclusions are con-
sistent with the findings of Julesz and Bergen
 , who also found that scaling down of a
search array to a much smaller size had essen-
tially no effect on performance.
Furthermore,
this is at least indirect confirmation
of studies
indicating that the size of the attentional focus
is dependent
on the task . However, we could
not confirm an effect of distance (retinal eccen-
tricity) on the latency of peak performance,
could have been predicted from the findings of

Discussion of experiments 3-5
In the previous section we have repeatedly
demonstrated
that at least one component
visual attention
is transient. This means that
it can be quickly summoned to a non-fixated
site but that it cannot be held there. This is
evident from the downturn
of the curves at
longer cue lead times in Figs 7-10. Despite this
downturn, it should be clear that it still remains
higher than when there was no cue present at all.
This is indicated by the two arrows to the left
and right of the lowest curve in Fig. 7: the solid
arrow adjacent to the ordinate shows the perfor-
mance level without any cue, and the open
arrow at the right hand portion of the curve
refers to performance
when a cue was left on
between trials.
From these data it should be evident that
attention can have two components: a sustained
component that can be moved voluntarily to a
particular region, even in the absence of a cue,
and a transient component which boosts perfor-
mance above and beyond that attainable under
sustained cuing conditions. We have shown that
this transient component
is time-locked to the
cuing stimulus.
In the next series of experiments we explore
the nature of the transient component,
how it is related to expectancy
and to the
characteristics
of the visual stimulus.

If our data indicating the separate existence
of a sustained and a transient attentional com-
ponent were correct,
they should be experi-
mentally separable. We reasoned that the data
shown in Figs 7-10 indicate that even though
the observer
“understood”
the target
would always appear at the cued location, this
knowledge alone was not sufficient to obtain
performance.
Performance
during a short interval just following the intro-
duction of the cue and degraded shortly there-
after. Thus, it seems to be caused by a more
primitive transient process that is independent
of awareness, but capable of boosting percep-
tion dramatically.
If we are correct in this interpretation.
prior knowledge of target position should have
little or no effect on the transient component.
To examine this issue, we conducted an addi-
tional experiment on two subjects to maximize
prior knowledge by adding consistency.
rather than changing position at random, the
cue and target were always in the same location
(the 3.5’ position
in Fig. 3). Otherwise the
experiment was the same as before.
Figure 11 shows the results from this experi-
ment. Most obvious is the characteristic rise and
fall in performance
as a function of cue lead
time. Thus, prior knowledge resulting from con-
stancy of cue position did not abolish the tran-
sient attentional effect. In fact, it appears that

eccentricity as seen in Fig. 3). Note that the transient
component remains. Arrows represent performance when

observer MM and 50msec for NW.
such a manipulation renders the cuing effect to
be almost entirely transient. This can be appre-
ciated by noting that performance for the longer
falls to the level of the “no cue”
(as denoted by the arrows on the
ordinate). That the transient boost in perfor-
mance was still present indicates independence
from higher order knowledge of the situation or
voluntary contro1.
E.uperiment

in performance
Such independence from “expectation” might
suggest that the summoning of this transient
is tied to a local sensory discharge
associated with the onset of the cue. This was
suggested by Posner, Cohen and Rafal 
who reported a small rise in reaction times for
longer cue lead times. Their view was that
a transient component
of attention
directly attributable
to the fact that even a
steady cue is likely to have a transient response
at its onset and this imparts a correspondingly
brief enhancement
of performance.
Breitmeyer and Canz as well as Lennie
 suggested that retinal Y-cells, with their
short latency and transient
response pattern
might mediate a primitive form of focal atten-
tion closely tied to a retinotopic
locus. These
interpretations
imply that at least one compo-
nent of attention is sensory in nature and closely
linked to visual neurons particularly sensitive to
transients.
If this were the case, one would predict that
a cue maintaining the transient stimulation, say
through flicker, would keep performance up for
the duration of the flickering cue.
To test this prediction,
we conducted
same experiment, modifying it only by having
the cue go on and off intermittently
quency which is well within the frequency-fol-
lowing characteristics of visual neurons (7.5 Hz
with a 50% duty cycle).
Figure 12 presents the data for two observers
under these conditions, showing the rise and fall
in performance
for increasing cue lead times.
Although it does appear that there may be some
quantitative differences from the data presented
earlier from subjects MM and NW, it is also
clear that the “downturn”
still persists and was
not abolished by the existence of flicker. This
indicates that the repetition
of local sensory
transients is not able to maintain attention at
the cued locus. Thus, the existence of this
decline in performance

of attention

Experiment 8: the “decoy” experiment-a
sensory transient is not necessary to summon
transient attention
In the experiment to be described, we provide
complementary
evidence to show that the local
sensory transient associated with cue onset is
not the basis of the transient summoning
attention. This was accomplished by setting up
a situation where no local sensory transient
exists at the cued site, yet where attentional
cuing remains intact. To accomplish this goal,
we started the trial by presenting the cue plus 7
additional boxes all indistinguishable
real cue. These seven boxes acted as “decoys”
and were unrelated to the target position. After
a 1 set period, the seven decoys were removed
just leaving one red box which constituted the
cue. The question is whether the existence of
this remaining cue, which itself generates no
local sensory transient, can summon the tran-
sient component
of focal attention.
sequence of the experiment is described as the
succession of frames depicted in Fig. 13.
The results from three observers demonstrate
that such a cuing stimulus can evoke a transient
attentional
component.
Figure 14 depicts the
performance as a function of cue lead time and
shows the pronounced
rise and subsequent fall
of performance
in this case as well.
It should be noted, however, that the onset
of the attentional shift is delayed in comparison
to the other cuing situations.
For example,
note the performance of MC (open circles) and
NW (open triangles) where the performance
curve stays flat and does not rise at all for
80-100 msec, yet where the characteristic
and fall is seen nevertheless.
Discussion of experiments 6-8
In these last 3 experiments we have shown
that the transient component of focal attention
remains intact under 3 very different conditions.

GENERAL DISCUSSION
Two Types of Attention
The results obtained in this investigation sug-
gest the existence of at least two types of
spatially directed attention,
a sustained and a
transient component. The schematic diagram in
Fig. 16 summarizes our conception of these two
components,
indicating how their combination
could result in the performance vs cue lead time
functions seen in the present study. It is our view
that both types of attention
can lead to an
improvement of performance, yet each appears
differentially dependent on what is commonly
“top-down”
vs “bottom-up”
processing.
The sustained component appears to be under
or “top-down”
control because we
have shown that it can be directed to a blank
region of the visual field at will (as shown in
Fig. 5). It does not require a visible cue for its
deployment.
The transient component,
however, is very
different. Prior knowledge or “expectancy”
garding target position
has no influence on
performance
and it is not subject to voluntary
control. This robust component is still obvious
and more or less unchanged even if the cue
appears in the same position for all trials (see
Fig. 11). Thus, if a person knows that a target
is to appear at a given locus, this fact alone does
not materially affect performance.
This lack of
dependence on the observer’s “expectancy”
garding stimulus location
and its close time
locking to the cuing event indicates that the
transient component
is more “primitive”
seemingly more closely tied to early visual pro-
cessing. Unlike the sustained component,
transient component is not susceptible to “top-
down” influences.
Fig. 16. Hypothetical summation of two attentional com-
ponents with different time courses.
At the same time, however, our results indi-
cate that the transient
is clearly
distinct from and not directly related to the
earliest stages of visual processing. The flicker-
ing cue experiment and the “decoy” experiment
suggest that the transient component
loosely coupled to early visual processing and
that it is autonomous
with respect to local
sensory transients. One cannot link the deploy-
ment of this component of attention to special-
ized early visual processes such as transient
visual channels as was suggested by others
 .
Neurophysiological Implications
Because these two components
of attention
can be distinguished by their susceptibility to
“higher” vs “lower” order processing, we sug-
gest that the two can be linked to different levels
of cortical processing, which have rather precise
meanings based on the pattern of intra- and
inter-cortical
connections
Essen, 1983; Van Essen & Maunsell,
Jones, Coulter & Hendry,
1978). We suggest
of spatially
directed attention is implemented at a relatively
lower order cortical level, lower than the imple-
mentation of the sustained component.
Such a hypothesis could be tested directly.
Neurophysiological
experiments
to date have
not made a distinction between these two com-
ponents and only the sustained component has
been investigated.
Clear effects of sustained
attention have been seen at the level of areas V4
and IT as well as in the
parietal cortex . No atten-
tional effects have been seen in striate cortex
 .
Little work, however, has concentrated on inter-
mediate areas. If our hypothesis was correct,
neurophysiological
correlates of the transient
component of visual attention should occur at a
lower cortical level than those of the sustained
component. Thus, we suggest that neural corre-
lates of transient visual attention would be seen
at a site earlier than area V4, perhaps as early
as Vl. In this context,
we suggest that our
“decoy” experiment may be useful in neuro-
physiological
experiments,
because one could
study the cell’s response without subjecting it to
the contaminating
influence of a transient stim-
ulus at the cued site.
KEN NAKAYAMA and MANFRED MACKEBEN
One additional feature of the transient atten-
tional data deserves special mention because it
can help determine
the size of the cortical
by focal attention.
targets and the spacing between targets are
relatively small as measured in terms of distance
on the striate cortex. As an example, consider
the case where the target array was an 8 min arc
annulus with 3 min arc targets separated
5 min arc (see Fig. 10). If we consider attention
to be confined to the locus of a single element
in this array, as demonstrated
by Krose and
Julesz then such an area in the visual
field at this eccentricity
(8 min arc) is com-
parable to the size of a single hypercolumn
the striate cortex . Single hypercolumns
in human subtend
approximately
1 square millimeter . Given the fact that the human
striate cortex has an area of about 2000 times
this size 
the spatial selectivity of visual focal attention is
quite remarkable.
Alternative Interpretations
For purposes of clarity, we have argued for
one line of interpretation,
that the transient
boost in performance,
although often closely
time-locked
with the stimulus, is not easily
explained in terms of early sensory processes,
nor is it explicable in terms of so-called “higher-
order” voluntary processes. Instead, we see it as
reflecting a transient visual attentional process,
operating at an intermediate cortical level, hav-
ing its own operating characteristics. We think
our data, taken as a whole, support such a view.
We acknowledge, however, that our interpreta-
tion might still be open to criticism and that
alternative interpretations
of individual experi-
ments based on lower level (sensory) or higher
levels of interaction could be raised. We men-
tion some of these possible interpretations
For the flickering cue experiment (No. 7)
one might argue that local visual units sensitive
to the target and the cue are reciprocally in-
hibitory. Sensitization to the target might then
be the result of a biphasic impulse response
function of the cue since a target presented
during the negative lobe of the cue response
would be enhanced via disinhibition. In such a
model, flickering the cue at its optimal temporal
frequency would have no effect on the target
enhancement, one could conceivably argue that
the flicker rate of 7.5 Hz just coincides with the
end of a hypothetical biphasic impulse response
function. Although this is a logical possibility,
we note that the phenomenon of temporal inter-
actions of stimuli has long been studied and no such process has been
described.
Concerning
the decoy experiment
one might argue that although no direct local
sensory transients occur with the offset of the
decoy cues, interactions with more remote loca-
tions in the retina might be able to change
the gain of the retina at any stimulated site (even
if it were a sustained response) and thus bestow
the cued site with a small local transient. The
evidence for this supposition, however, is weak.
First, the argument assumes that such remote
interactions
are multiplicative
(as opposed to
additive), yet there is no indication that they are.
Second. it should be remembered
that in the
decoy experiment, the cue has been left on for
one second before the removal of the decoys.
Thus, the response to the cue must be mediated
by sustained mechanisms. Yet neurophysiologi-
cal recordings from sustained cells in the pri-
mate lateral geniculate
nucleus indicate
susceptibility to remote interactions . Finally, the very short
latency (approx. 40 msec) of this remote activa-
tion in primates is not in
accord with the prolonged delay of transient
visual attention seen under these conditions.
In addition to the “sensory” interpretations,
one could adopt a very different viewpoint and
argue that the transient nature of visual atten-
tion is better explained in terms of higher level
processes by considering the demands of the
task. It has been hypothesized, for example, that
the act of maintaining gaze at a fixation point
requires at least some attentional resources . Because our observers were in-
structed to maintain fixation. it is possible that
the cue draws attention to the periphery, but
that the instruction
to the observer
him/her to shift attention back to the fixation
Although this interpretation
deserves addi-
tional investigation, we make two points that
render such an argument less plausible. First, it
would be rather
surprising
if the subjects’
“effort of will” to maintain fixation would yield
such abrupt temporal functions, showing pre-
performance
100 msec after reaching peak performance. This
is particularly evident in the data of MM (see
Focal visual attention
Figs 7, 9 and 11). Second is the fact that in
another study , we think the technique has disadvantages
in comparison
to the present approach, which
make it less desirable as a method for future use.
Two problems seem most limiting: first is the
fact that a reaction time task does not dissociate
a motor from a sensory component.
the observer to respond as quickly as possible,
one runs the risk that the results may be influ-
enced by a greater range of extraneous factors.
Our use of a discrimination
task where the
observer has essentially unlimited time to make
his decision provides a more direct access to
visual attention because it decouples perception
from the motor
aspects of responding.
recent studies have also used this approach with
success .
A second problem with the reaction time task is
that it is not easily related to other psychophys-
ical and neurophysiological
measures. This may
be of considerable importance when trying to
relate changes in tuning properties of single cells
 with attentional shifts. We
think that this could be more easily achieved by
measuring discrimination
performance.
Despite these potential problems associated
experiments,
there is some agreement on at least one major
point: both types of data can show a transient
of attention.
In a few cases, a
shortening of reaction times for cue lead times
of lOC300 msec and a very subtle lengthening
for longer cue lead times have been reported
et al., 1982; Remington
1984; Maylor,
1985). We attribute
quantitative
difference between those data and
our own to the much greater demand put on
discrimination performance in our paradigm (in
respect to spatial resolution, stimulus duration,
and number of possible locations), which neces-
sitates activation
of perceptual
resources not
challenged in those previous studies.
Unresolved Questions
We would like to note two observations
which deserve additional clarification. The first
question pertains to the conditions under which
the rise and fall of transient attention is appar-
ent. Although
not addressed directly in this
paper, it should be clear from the top curve in
Fig. 7 that the “down-turn”
in performance
not always present . In the data
shown, there is no down-turn in performance
for the longest stimulus presentation
One possibility is that the lack of a performance
downturn in easier tasks is due to a “ceiling”
artifact because the underlying process responsi-
ble for the transient rise is “clipped.”
The second question pertains to the exact
time course of the transient
component.
general we have found that attention
somewhere around 80-100 msec cue lead time,
although it can be somewhat variable. We con-
sistently find that the optimal cue lead time is
considerably longer in the vernier acuity task,
although the finding has not been detailed here.
Since the spatial scale required for the vernier
acuity task may be higher than for the vertical
vs horizontal
bar discrimination,
it might be
reasonable to suppose that it could take more
time to narrow down the focus of attention for
a high acuity target. As yet, however, we have
no additional data which would support such
conjecture.
Functional Considerations
In this section we briefly touch upon two
functional implications of the results obtained.
First we consider the duration of the focal
attention process. Its time course is somewhat at
odds with currently held views of visual atten-
tion. Julesz as well as Treisman 
postulate a quick redirection of attention, con-
cluding that in visual search tasks, attention can
jump from item to item in 30-40 msec intervals.
The relatively long duration of transient atten-
tion reported here may be inconsistent with such
a view although it should also be noted that the
task demands in our study are very different
from those in standard visual search tasks where
no cue is present.
The second consideration concerns the invol-
untary nature of transient visual attention. By
involuntary we mean its quasi-reflex quality, its
