Abstract. Recent approaches for instance-aware semantic labeling have
augmented convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with complex multitask architectures or computationally expensive graphical models. We
present a method that leverages a fully convolutional network (FCN)
to predict semantic labels, depth and an instance-based encoding using
each pixel’s direction towards its corresponding instance center. Subsequently, we apply low-level computer vision techniques to generate stateof-the-art instance segmentation on the street scene datasets KITTI and
Cityscapes. Our approach outperforms existing works by a large margin
and can additionally predict absolute distances of individual instances
from a monocular image as well as a pixel-level semantic labeling.
Introduction
The task of visual semantic scene understanding is mainly tackled from two opposing facets: pixel-level semantic labeling and bounding-box object
detection . The ﬁrst assigns each pixel in an image with a semantic label segmenting the semantically connected regions in the scene. Such
approaches work well with non-compact (background) classes such as buildings
or ground, yet they do not distinguish individual object instances. Object detection aims to ﬁnd all individual instances in the scene and describes them via
bounding boxes. Therefore, the latter provides a rather coarse localization and
is restricted to compact (object) classes such as cars or humans.
Recently, instance-level semantic labeling gained increasing interest . This task is at the intersection of both challenges. The aim is to combine
the detection task with instance segmentation. Such a representation allows for
a precise localization, which in turn enables better scene understanding. Especially in the domain of robotics and autonomous vehicles, instance-level semantic

instance center direction. Those are used to compute template matching score
maps for semantic categories. Using these, we locate and generate instance proposals and fuse them to obtain our instance segmentation.
segmentation enables an explicit occlusion reasoning, precise object tracking and
motion estimation, as well as behavior modeling and prediction.
Most state-of-the-art methods build upon a fully convolutional network (FCN)
 . Recent approaches typically add post-processing, for example, based on
conditional random ﬁelds (CRFs) . Other methods score region proposals for instance segmentation or object detection , or use a
multi-stage neural network for these tasks .
In this work, we focus on street scene understanding and use a single monocular image to simultaneously obtain a holistic scene representation, consisting of
a pixel-level semantic labeling, an instance-level segmentation of traﬃc participants, and a 3D depth estimation for each instance. We leverage an FCN that
yields powerful pixel-level cues consisting of three output channels: a semantic
class, the direction to the object center (where applicable) and the object distance (where applicable). Scene understanding is mainly due to the network and
post-processing with standard computer vision methods is suﬃcient to obtain a
detailed representation of an instance-aware semantic segmentation, c.f . Figs. 1
and 2. Our method signiﬁcantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the
street scene datasets KITTI and Cityscapes .
Related Work
For the task of instance-level semantic labeling, there exist two major lines of
research. The ﬁrst leverages an over-complete set of object proposals that are
either rejected, classiﬁed as an instance of a certain semantic class, and reﬁned
to obtain an instance segmentation. Common to all such methods is that the
performance is depending on the quality of these proposals, since they cannot
recover from missing instances in the proposal stage. Generally, such approaches
Pixel Encoding and Depth Layering for Instance-level Semantic Labeling
tend to be slow since all proposals must be classiﬁed individually. These properties cause inaccurate proposals to limit the performance of such methods .
Our method belongs to the category of proposal-free methods, where the segmentation and the semantic class of object instances are inferred jointly.
Proposal-based instance segmentation. Driven by the success of deep learning based object detectors such as R-CNN or its variants , recent
methods rely on these detections for instance segmentation. Either the underlying region proposals, such as MCG , are directly used as instance segments , or the bounding boxes are reﬁned to obtain instance masks . Instead
of bounding boxes, uses a layered pictorial structure (LPS) model, where
shape exemplars for object parts are mapped to the image in a probabilistic way.
This yields an initial proposal for the object’s pose and shape, which is reﬁned
using appearance cues. Using a bank of object detectors as proposals, infers the instance masks via occlusion reasoning based on discrete depth layers.
In , pixel-level semantic labels are used to score object candidates and vice
versa in an alternating fashion, while also reasoning about occlusions and scene
geometry. Based on proposals that form a segmentation tree, an energy function
is constructed in and its solution yields the instance segmentation.
Recently, extended the R-CNN for instance segmentation with a multitask network cascade. A fully convolutional network combined with three classi-
ﬁcation stages produces bounding-box proposals, reﬁnes these to segments, and
ranks them to obtain the ﬁnal instance-level labeling. They achieve excellent
performance on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO .
Proposal-free instance segmentation. Pixel-level semantic labeling based on
neural networks has been very successful . This triggered interest
in casting also instance segmentation directly as a pixel labeling task. In ,
the network predicts for each pixel, whether it lies on an object boundary or not,
however, requiring a rather delicate training. Using a long short-term memory
(LSTM) network , instance segmentations can be sequentially sampled .
In , instances are encoded via numbers that are further constrained
to encode relative depth ordering in order to prevent arbitrary assignments. An
FCN predicts these IDs at each pixel and a subsequent Markov Random Field
(MRF) improves these predictions and enforces consistency. However, such a
method is limited to scenes, where a clear depth ordering is present, e.g. a single
row of parking cars, and the maximum number of instances is rather low.
The proposal-free network (PFN) is a CNN that yields a pixel-level semantic labeling, the number of instances in the scene, and for each pixel the
parameters of a corresponding instance bounding box. Based on these predictions, instances are obtained by clustering. The network has a fairly complex
architecture with many interleaved building blocks, making training quite tricky.
Further, the overall performance highly depends on the correct prediction of the
number of instances in the scene. In street scenes, there can be hundreds of
instances per image . Thus, the number of training samples per number of
instances is low, mistakes in their estimation can be critical, and the available
cues for clustering might not correlate with the estimated number of instances.

In this work, we focus on urban street scenes. Besides each pixel’s semantic
class, our network estimates an absolute depth, which is particularly useful for
instance separation in street scenes. We encode instances on a pixel-level by
the direction towards their center point. This representation is independent of
the number of instances per image and provides strong signals at the instance
boundaries.
FCN Feature Representation
Our network extends the FCN-8s model with three output channels that together facilitate instance segmentation. All channels are jointly trained as pixelwise discrete labeling tasks using standard cross-entropy losses. Our proposed
representation consists of (1) a semantic channel that drives the instance classiﬁcation, (2) a depth channel to incorporate scale and support instance separation,
and (3) a 2D geometric channel to facilitate instance detection and segmentation.
We chose the upscaling part of our FCN such that we can easily change the
number of classes for each of the three proposed channels without re-initializing
all upsampling layers. To this end, after the largest downsampling factor is
reached, we use Deconvolution layers together with skip layers to produce
a representation of 1
8 of the input resolution with a depth of 100 throughout all
intermediate layers. The number of channels of this abstract representation is
then reduced through 1×1 convolutions to the proposed semantic, depth, and
instance center channels. To reach full input resolution, bilinear upsampling is
applied, followed by a separate cross-entropy loss for each of our three output
Semantics. To cope with diﬀerent semantic classes, we predict a semantic label
for each input pixel, c.f . Fig. 3a. These predictions are particularly important
as they are the only source of semantic information in our approach. Further,
the predicted semantic labels allow us to separate objects from background as
well as objects of diﬀerent classes from each other.
Depth. Urban street scenes typically contain objects at various distances .
To guide the post-processing in terms of objects at diﬀerent scales, we predict a
Pixel Encoding and Depth Layering for Instance-level Semantic Labeling
depth label for each object pixel. We assign all pixels within an object instance
to a constant depth value, e.g. the median over noisy measurements or the center
of a 3D bounding box, c.f . Fig. 3b. These depth estimates also support instance
separation, which becomes apparent when considering a row of parking cars,
where the depth delta between neighboring cars is a full car length instead of a
few centimeters in continuous space. The depth values are discretized into a set
of classes so that close objects have a ﬁner depth resolution than distant objects.
Direction. Object instances are deﬁned by their boundary and class. Therefore,
it seems natural to train an FCN model to directly predict boundary pixels.
However, those boundaries represent a very delicate signal as they have a
width of only one pixel, and a single erroneously labeled pixel in the training
data has a much higher impact compared to a region-based representation.
We introduce a class-based representation which implicitly combines information about an instance’s boundary with the location of its visible center. For
each object pixel we compute the direction towards its corresponding center
and discretize this angle to a set of classes, c.f . Fig. 3c. This information is
easier to grasp within a local region and is tailored for an FCN’s capability to
predict pixel-wise labels. Especially for pixels on the boundary between neighboring objects, our representation clearly separates the instances as predictions
have nearly opposite directions. Since we predict the center of the visible area
of an object and not its physical center, we can handle most types of occlusions
very well. Furthermore, instance centers have a distinct pattern, c.f . Fig. 3c,
which we exploit by applying template matching, as described in Sec. 3.2. Even
though our proposed representation does not directly yield instance IDs, it is
well deﬁned even for an arbitrary number of instances per image.
To obtain an accurate direction estimation for each pixel, we assign the average direction by weighting all direction vectors with their respective FCN score
(after softmax normalization). This allows us to recover a continuous direction
estimation from the few discretized classes.
Template Matching
To extract instance centers, we propose template matching on the direction
predictions, where templates are rectangular and contain the distinct pattern
visible in Fig. 3c. We adjust the template’s aspect ratio depending on its semantic
class, so we can better distinguish between pedestrians and vehicles. In order to
detect also distant objects with consistent matching scores, we scale the size of
the templates depending on the predicted depth class.
To reduce induced errors from confusions between objects of similar semantic
classes, we combine multiple semantic classes into the categories human, car,
large vehicle, and two wheeler.
Normalized cross-correlation (NCC) is used to produce a score map for each
category by correlating all pixels with their respective template. These maps
indicate the likelihood of pixels being an instance center, c.f . Fig. 2. In the
following, we predict instances for each category separately. After all instances
are found, we assign them the majority semantic class label.

Instance Generation
Instance Centers. To determine instance locations, we iteratively ﬁnd maxima
in the generated template matching score maps via non-maximum suppression
within an area that equals the template size. This helps avoid multiple detections
of the same instance while incorporating typical object sizes. Those maxima
represent our temporary instance centers, which are reﬁned and merged in the
following steps.
Instance Proposals. Each pixel with a predicted direction from the FCN is
assigned to the closest temporary instance center where the relative location
and predicted direction agree. Joining all assigned pixels per instance hypothesis
yields a set of instance proposals.
Proposal Fusion. Elongated objects and erroneous depth predictions cause
an over-segmentation of the instances. Thus, we reﬁne the generated instances
by accumulating estimated directions within each proposal. When interpreting
direction predictions as vectors, they typically compensate each other within
instance proposals that represent a complete instance, i.e. there are as many
predictions pointing both left and right. However, incomplete instance proposals
are biased to a certain direction. If there is a neighboring instance candidate
with matching semantic class and depth in the direction of this bias, the two
proposals are fused.
To the remaining instances we assign the average depth and the most frequent semantic class label within the region. Further, we merge our instance
prediction with the pixel-level semantic labeling channel of the FCN by assigning the argmax semantic label to all non-instance pixels. Overall, we obtain a
consistent scene representation, consisting of object instances paired with depth
estimates and pixel-level labels for background classes.
Experiments
Datasets and Metrics
We evaluated our approach on the KITTI object detection dataset extended
with instance-level segmentations as well as Cityscapes . Both datasets
provide pixel-level annotations for semantic classes and instances, as well as
depth information, which is essential for our approach. For the ground truth
instance depths we used the centers of their 3D bounding box annotation in
KITTI and the median disparity for each instance in Cityscapes based on the
provided disparity maps. We used the oﬃcial splits for training, validation and
test sets.
We evaluated the segmentation based on the metrics proposed in and .
To evaluate the depth prediction, we computed the mean absolute error (MAE),
the root mean squared error (RMSE), the absolute relative diﬀerence (ARD),
and the relative inlier ratios (δ1, δ2, δ3) for thresholds δi = 1.25i . These
metrics are computed on an instance level using the depths in meters. We only
considered instances that overlap by more than 50 % with the ground truth.

Network Details
For Cityscapes, we used the 19 semantic classes and combined the 8 object classes
into 4 categories (car, human, two-wheeler, and large vehicle). For KITTI, only
car instance segmentations are available. For both datasets, we used 19 depth
classes and an explicit class for background. We chose ranges for each depth
class and template sizes diﬀerently for each dataset to account for diﬀerent characteristics of present objects and used camera settings . This is necessary as
distances and semantic classes of objects diﬀer remarkably. Details are provided
in the supplementary material. The instance directions were split into 8 equal
parts, each covering an angle of 45◦for both datasets.
We use the 8-stride version of an FCN, which is initialized using the ImageNet
dataset . After initializing the upsampling layers randomly, we ﬁne-tune the
network on KITTI and Cityscapes to obtain all three output channels.
Ablation Studies
We evaluated the inﬂuence of each proposed component by leaving out one or
more components from the complete processing pipeline (Ours). The performance was evaluated on the respective validation sets and is listed in Tables 1
and 2 (top) for both datasets.

KITTI test
For Ours-D, we removed the depth channel and chose the template size scaleagnostic. It turned out that a rather small template size, which leads to a large
number of instance proposals, produces the best results. This is possible when
post-processing heavily relies on correct direction predictions, which induces
successful instance fusion. However, the performance is signiﬁcantly worse in
most metrics on both datasets compared to our full system, which shows that the
depth information is an essential component of our approach. When the fusion
component was also removed (Ours-D-F), a larger template size was needed to
prevent an over-segmentation. However, performance dropped by an even larger
margin than for Ours-D. In our last variant we kept the depth information
but directly used the instance proposals as ﬁnal instance predictions (Ours-
F). The performance was even slightly worse than Ours-D, which shows that
all our components are important to obtain accurate object instances. These
observations are consistent on both datasets.
Instance Evaluation
KITTI. We clearly outperform all existing works on KITTI (Best / ),
c.f . Table 1 (bottom). Compared to the better performing work Best , we
achieve a margin of 37 % relative improvement averaged over all metrics. Even
when comparing our single variant with the best numbers over all existing variants for each metric individually (Mix ), we achieve a signiﬁcantly better
performance. We also evaluated our approach using the metrics introduced in
 to enable comparisons in future publications, c.f . Table 2 (bottom). Qualitative results are shown in Fig. 4.
Cityscapes. On the Cityscapes dataset, our approach outperforms the baseline
MCG+R-CNN in all proposed metrics as evaluated by the dataset’s submis-

of the main score AP. Compared to the performance on KITTI, c.f . Table 2
(bottom), the numbers are signiﬁcantly lower, indicating the higher complexity
of scenes in Cityscapes. Qualitative results are shown in Fig. 5.
Depth Evaluation
As shown in Table 3, the average relative and mean absolute error of our predicted instances are as low as 7.7 % and 1.7 m, respectively, on the KITTI dataset.
On the Cityscapes dataset, which contains much more complex scenes, with
many and distant object instances, we achieve 11.3 % and 7.7 m, respectively.
These results are particularly impressive, since we used only single monocular
images as input for our network. We hope that future publications compare their
depth estimation performance using the proposed metrics.
Evaluation of semantic class labels
Our method also yields a pixel-level semantic labeling including background
classes that we evaluate on Cityscapes, c.f . Table 4. We compare to two baselines, FCN 8s that uses the same FCN architecture as our approach and Dilation10 , which is the currently best performing approach on Cityscapes .

It can be seen that our approach is on par with the state-of-the-art although
this work focuses on the harder instance segmentation task.
Conclusion
In this work, we present a fully convolutional network that predicts pixel-wise
depth, semantics, and instance-level direction cues to reach an excellent level of
holistic scene understanding. Instead of complex architectures or graphical models for post-processing, our approach performs well using only standard computer
vision techniques applied to the network’s three output channels. Our approach
does not depend on region proposals and scales well for arbitrary numbers of
object instances in an image.
We outperform existing works on the challenging urban street scene datasets
Cityscapes and KITTI by a large margin. On KITTI, our approach
achieves 37 % relative improvement averaged over all metrics and we almost double the performance on Cityscapes. As our approach can reliably predict absolute
depth values per instance, we provide an instance-based depth evaluation. Our
depth predictions achieve a relative error of only a few meters, even though the
datasets contain instances in more than one hundred meters distance. The main
focus of this work is instance segmentation, but we also achieve state-of-the-art
performance for pixel-level semantic labeling on Cityscapes, with a new best
performance on an instance-based score over categories.

Qualitative Results
Figures 1 and 2 show further qualitative examples of our instance segmentation
on urban scenes from KITTI and Cityscapes . It can be seen that our
approach can segment even high numbers of instances despite heavy occlusions
and clutter.
Depth Ranges
As mentioned in Sec. 3.1, we discretized continuous instance depths into 19 depth
classes. Instead of equidistantly splitting them, we chose the ranges for each class
such that the sizes of objects within each depth class are similar. We found this
option to yield slightly better results, since the subsequent template matching
is based on our FCN’s depth prediction and equal object sizes per depth class
result in more reliable template matching scores.
We deﬁned the values as in Table 2 to provide a good trade-oﬀbetween
number of depth classes and depth resolution, as well as number of samples per
depth class in the training data. As the Cityscapes dataset contains a lot of
object instances labeled for very high distances of over 200 meters , the depth
ranges had to be chosen diﬀerently than for KITTI .
Class-level Evaluation
Instance-level Evaluation
We list class-level performances of our approach for instance-level semantic labeling (Ours) and the baseline MCG+R-CNN in Table 1. Our approach has
diﬃculties especially for semantic classes that are least reliably classiﬁed by our
FCN, such as bus, truck, and train c.f . Tables 3 to 5. Best results are achieved
for cars and humans, while we outperform the proposal-based baseline for all
other classes by large margins in all used metrics.

Pixel-level Evaluation
A detailed evaluation of our performance for pixel-level semantic labeling can
be found in Tables 3 to 5. Even though our main focus lies on instance-level
semantic labeling, we achieve competitive results for all classes compared to the
baselines listed in . Using the instance-aware metric iIoU, we even outperform
most existing works by a few percent points for the object classes person, car,
and bicycle.
The reason for a comparably low performance on the classes bus, truck, and
train becomes evident by inspecting Tables 3 and 4. We achieve comparably
low semantic labeling results on a pixel-level for these classes and therefore our
template matching and instance generation steps perform signiﬁcantly worse
than on all other object classes.
