Received 2006 September 19; accepted 2006 October 10; published 2006 December 13
A cosmology calculator that computes times and distances as a function of redshift for userdeﬁned cosmological parameters has been made available online. This paper gives the formulae used by the
cosmology calculator and discusses some of its implementation. A version of the calculator that allows one to
specify the equation-of-state parameter w and
, and one for converting the light-travel times usually given in
the popular press into redshifts, is also located at the same site.
1. INTRODUCTION
There are many deﬁnitions of distance in cosmology, and it
is often frustrating to calculate the kind of distance needed for
a given situation. In particular, press releases 2 very often use the “light-travel time distance,”
, even though this distance has many unde-
sirable characteristics. I wrote the cosmology calculator in order
to be able to calculate
along with the observable angular
and luminosity distances
, respectively. It also com-
putes the proper radial distance, which is the only distance that
is compatible with the common deﬁnition of distance for moving objects: the spatial separation at a common time. The common time used is right now, or
. This is called
, also known as the comoving radial distance, is
not measurable from a single position, but can in principle be
measured by a family of comoving observers. It is the one
distance that satisﬁes the Hubble law exactly—dD/dt p
—without any corrections. Other distances are deﬁned
using quantities taken from more than one time and generally
only satisfy the Hubble law to ﬁrst order.
2. EQUATIONS
The following results have been given many times before.
Hogg gives equations that are equivalent to the ones in
this paper, but for completeness in documenting the cosmology
calculator, the equations are spelled out below.
The metric is given by

radius of curvature is given by
R p (c/H )/(F1  Q F)
since I use the normalization that
at the current time,
so the redshift is given by
. The past light cone is
1  z p 1/a
, so the comoving radial distance is
cdt p a(t)R dw
and of course the light-travel time distance is given by
p c[t  t(z)].
The exact dynamics of the universe can be captured using the
energy equation from the Newtonian approximation to cosmology, which gives
General relativity modiﬁes the acceleration equation by including the pressure as a source of gravity, but this just cancels
the variation of the enclosed mass
caused by the pres-
sure, so the energy equation is exact. Thus, we can write

To ﬁrst order, this agrees with the redshift, so
. Thus, the angular size distance—deﬁned as

that subtends an angle v on the sky—is given by

3. IMPLEMENTATION
The cosmology calculator is implemented as a Web page
(CosmoCalc)3 that has a large number of JavaScript deﬁnitions in
the header, followed by immediately executed JavaScript that
writes a frame set to the current document. The frame set calls
for the input form (CCform)4 and the output page (CCout).5 If
JavaScript is not enabled, or if there is an error in the JavaScript,
then the body of CosmoCalc is displayed. This body is just an
error message saying that JavaScript must be enabled.
I have received several requests for the code used in the
cosmology calculator; but since the code is in JavaScript, it is
in the HTML ﬁles in ASCII form. It is easy to save the page
source to get the code, and it is easy to modify the code using
any text editor. If your modiﬁcations introduce an error, then
you will see the error message saying that JavaScript must be
enabled. This only means that you must ﬁnd the error in your
modiﬁed CosmoCalc. I have had to do this dozens of times,
so do not be discouraged.
Even if you do not intend to modify the code, downloading
the three HTML ﬁles will let you run the calculator locally
when not connected to the Internet.
The numerical evaluation of the integrals for Z and t is done

using the midpoint rule with 1000 panels. While this is not a
very efﬁcient use of CPU time, it was very easy to code. And
with JavaScript, the CPU time is consumed on the user’s computer instead of on the server. The functions being integrated
go smoothly to zero as a goes to zero, as long as
Another hidden aspect of the cosmology calculator is that it
automatically sets the radiation density
to the value ap-
propriate for
K and three massless neutrino
T p 2.72528
Q h p 4.165 # 10
h p H /(100 km s
, and this factor includes a small (!1%) boost in the
neutrino density due to a slight transfer to
annihilation
energy into neutrinos . Therefore,
if you want to verify some simple cases, such as the empty
universe, you should use a large value of the Hubble constant,
which reduces the relative importance of this radiation term.
For example, the “Open” button with
gives an age of the universe of 9.934 Gyr, which is 0.7%
from the expected 10 Gyr. But using
gives an age
of 999 Myr, which is only 0.1% from the expected 1 Gyr.
For very early times, the age of the universe is adjusted to
allow for the existence of
, etc., using the terms
for the standard model of particle physics given by
Kolb & Turner .
4. LIGHT-TRAVEL TIME INVERSION
A slightly modiﬁed version of the cosmology calculator
(DlttCalc) is also posted online.6 The input form asks for the
light-travel time in Gyr, instead of redshift. The redshift is found
by evaluating the integral for light-travel time in steps of
0.001 in a, starting from
until the input value is exa p 1
ceeded, and then interpolating to get a and thus z. Once z is
known, the calculations proceed as in CosmoCalc.
5. MORE OPTIONS
Since the cosmology calculator was ﬁrst written, there have
been two developments that have changed the kinds of models
that people want to run. I have created a new version of the
cosmology calculator (ACC) that has more options and have
made it available on the Web.7 One development is the discovery of neutrino oscillations, indicating that the assumption
of massless neutrinos is not correct. The neutrino temperature
K, and a typical momentum for a thermal
neutrino is ≈
. This corresponds to the rest energy of a
neutrino with
eV. Since the neutrinos thermalized
mc ≈0.0005
while still relativistic, their distribution is that of a relativistic

The number of spin states for a neutrino is one, but to allow
for antineutrinos, one should use
The integral over neutrino momentum has to be evaluated
for each step of the integration over a, so it needs to be
done efﬁciently, even when the work is done on the user’s
computer. In the low-temperature limit when
integral over x evaluates to
, while in the
m (3/4)z(3)G(3)
high-temperature limit
, the integral evaluates to
. Both limits can be evaluated correctly
(kT /c )(7/8)z(4)G(4)
by approximating the integral using

≈m (3/4)z(3)G(3) 1  (x kT /m c ) ,
with the single integration knot at
x p [(7/8)z(4)G(4)]
. This approximation has a maximum
[(3/4)z(3)G(3)] p 3.151
error of !3%. However, a better approximation is
m  x (kT ) /c
exp (x)  1
p m (3/4)z(3)G(3)f(x kT /m c ),
f(y) ≈(1  y )
, which has a maximum error !0.3%. The mass
at which neutrinos are semirelativistic at the current epoch is
m c p x kT
p 0.000531(T /2.72528 K) eV.
The ﬁnal result is that the effective neutrino density can be
written as
m f[m (1  z)/m ]
93.14 eV/c
The normalization of 93.14 eV is from Mangano et al. 
and is 1.05% higher than the nominal, due to residual coupling
of annihilation energy to the neutrinos. In the relativistic limit,

For a hierarchical neutrino mass pattern with masses ≈0.001,
0.009, and 0.049 eV, the change in distances introduced by
neutrino masses is negligible. At redshifts up to 5 in the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe concordance ﬂat LCDM

, the changes are less
than 0.01%. This mass pattern is the default when ACC is
loaded. But even the more massive nearly degenerate neutrino
mass patterns, such as ≈0.33, 0.33, and 0.33 eV, have a minimal
effect on the distances and times.
The second change in the paradigm is the introduction of
the equation of state
as a parameter in the model.

analytic solution for the dark energy density as a function of
z. This solution is

The defaults are

reduces to the CosmoCalc case.
Unlike the neutrino masses, changes in w have substantial
effects on distances and ages. Changing w to 0.7 instead of
the default 1 changes the age of the universe by 6% and the
luminosity distance at

Finally, ACC allows one to input

of simple cases. With these changes, the X-function is

The rest of the calculation of distances is unchanged.
6. CONCLUSION
These cosmology calculators are suitable for interactive
use, providing fairly quick answers for single cases. Users
who wish to use the code for large-scale calculations should
translate it into a compiled language and change the quadrature formula. In particular, if ﬁtting to data sets with redshifts and distance, the data should be sorted by redshift, and
the distance integrals should be evaluated for all objects in a
single pass through the sorted data. Plotting ﬁgures is an
obvious case in which redshifts are computed in order: Fig-
