IMPORTANCE—Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is standard treatment for reducing severe
visual loss from proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). However, PRP can damage the retina,
resulting in peripheral vision loss or worsening diabetic macular edema (DME).
OBJECTIVE—Compare ranibizumab versus PRP for PDR.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Randomized clinical trial (55 U.S. sites)
assessing non-inferiority of ranibizumab compared with PRP for vision outcomes; 305 adults with

PDR enrolled February-December 2012 (mean age 52, 44% female, 52% white). Both eyes
enrolled for 89 participants totaling 394 study eyes. The final 2-year visit was completed January
INTERVENTIONS—Ranibizumab group (N=191 eyes): intravitreous 0.5-mg ranibizumab and,
PRP if treatment failed; ranibizumab as needed for DME. PRP group (N=203 eyes): PRP;
ranibizumab as needed for DME.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Primary: mean visual acuity change at 2 years (5letter non-inferiority margin; intention-to-treat analysis). Secondary: visual acuity area under the
curve, peripheral visual field loss, DME development, neovascularization, vitrectomy, and safety.
RESULTS—Mean visual acuity letter improvement at 2 years was +2.8 in the ranibizumab group
versus +0.2 in the PRP group (difference +2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.5 to +5.0, noninferiority P<0.001). Mean treatment group difference in visual acuity area under the curve over 2
years was +4.2 (95% CI: +3.0 to +5.4, P<0.001). Visual field sensitivity loss was worse (mean dB
difference 372; 95% CI: 213 to 531, P<0.001), vitrectomy more frequent (15% versus 4%,
difference 9%, 95% CI: 4% to 15%, P<0.001), and DME development more frequent (28% versus
9%, difference 19%, 95% CI: 10% to 28%, P<0.001) in the PRP versus ranibizumab group,
respectively. Eyes with neither active nor regressed neovascularization at 2 years was similar (35%
[ranibizumab group] versus 30% [PRP group], difference 3%, 95% CI: −7% to 12%, P=0.58). One
eye (ranibizumab group) developed endophthalmitis. No significant differences between groups in
rates of major cardiovascular events were identified.
CONCLUSION—Among eyes with PDR, treatment with ranibizumab resulted in visual acuity
that was non-inferior to (not worse than) PRP treatment at two years. Although longer term
follow-up is needed, ranibizumab may be a reasonable treatment alternative, at least through 2
years, for patients with PDR.
Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a leading cause of vision loss in patients with
diabetes mellitus,1, 2 resulting in 12,000 to 24,000 new cases of blindness each year in the
United States.3 Without treatment, nearly 50% of patients with high-risk PDR experience
severe vision loss within five years.4
Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) has been the standard treatment for PDR since the
Diabetic Retinopathy Study demonstrated its benefit nearly 40 years ago.4 PRP is effective,
in part, because it reduces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).5 In a 2014 survey,
98% of retina specialists reported using PRP for initial PDR management in the absence of
DME.6 However, it can cause permanent peripheral visual field loss, decreased night vision,
and may exacerbate diabetic macular edema (DME), which makes alternative treatments
desirable.7–9 Even with timely PRP, about 5% of eyes develop severe vision loss4, 7
When used for diabetic macular edema (DME) treatment, intravitreous anti-VEGF agents
reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy worsening and increase the chance of
improvement10–12, making these agents a potentially viable PDR treatment. Therefore, we
conducted a randomized trial evaluating the non-inferiority of intravitreous ranibizumab
compared with PRP for visual acuity outcomes in patients with PDR.

This multi-center randomized clinical trial was conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy
Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) at 55 clinical sites in the United States. The study
adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki13 and was approved by multiple
institutional review boards. Study participants provided written informed consent. An
independent data and safety monitoring committee provided oversight. The study protocol is
available in the supplemental material.
Study Population
Study participants were at least 18 years old, had type 1 or type 2 diabetes, at least one eye
with PDR, no previous PRP, and a best corrected visual acuity letter score ≥24 (approximate
Snellen equivalent 20/320 or better). Eyes with or without DME were eligible. All eligibility
criteria are in Table S1. Baseline demographics (Table 1) demonstrated balance among
treatment groups. Age was patient reported, gender was determined by study staff, and race/
ethnicity (based on fixed categories) were either patient reported or determined by study
Synopsis of Study Design
A participant could have one or two eyes included in the study. Using the DRCR.net study
website to conceal the next treatment allocation, using a permuted block design, participants
with one study eye were randomly assigned with equal probability to either PRP with
ranibizumab as needed for DME treatment (PRP group) or intravitreous-0.5 mg ranibizumab
with PRP for treatment failure (ranibizumab group) (injection procedure: http://
drcrnet.jaeb.org/ViewPage.aspx?PageName=Investig_Info). Participants with two study eyes
had one eye assigned randomly to PRP and the other to ranibizumab (Table S1).
The primary outcome visit was at 2 years, with follow-up planned through 5 years. Only
data through 2 years are reported. In both groups, visits occurred every 16 weeks.
Ranibizumab group participants had additional visits every 4 weeks during the first year and
every 4 to 16 weeks during the second year depending on treatment (eFigure S1).
At baseline and each follow-up visit, certified personnel obtained best corrected visual
acuity using the Electronic-Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (e-ETDRS) Visual
Acuity Test14. Spectral (96% of scans), or time-domain ocular coherence tomography
(OCT), was performed at baseline, annually and as needed for DME treatment assessment.
Humphrey visual field testing (at select sites) on 30-2 and 60-4 patterns and digital fundus
photographs were obtained at baseline and annually (Table S1). Images and visual fields
were graded by centralized reading centers when applicable (Table S1). At baseline and
annually, participants with one study eye completed visual function questionnaires and
binocular visual acuity testing with everyday correction (Table S1). Adverse events were
coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).
Reading center graders and the medical monitor who reviewed all adverse events were
masked to treatment assignments. Visual acuity and OCT technicians were masked to

treatment group assignments at annual visits. Study participants, investigators and study
coordinators were not masked due to the nature of the treatments.
Treatment Protocol
PDR—In the ranibizumab group, study eyes received an injection for PDR at baseline and
every 4 weeks through 12 weeks. Thereafter, retreatment was based on investigator
assessment of neovascularization (NV) on extended ophthalmoscopy and any available
retinal images. Injections at 16 and 20 weeks were required unless all NV resolved. Starting
at the 24-week visit, an injection was required every 4 weeks unless NV resolved or was
stable (not improved or worsened) following 2-consectuive injections. Injections resumed if
NV worsened. Injections for PDR could be performed at investigator discretion if not
required. PRP for PDR was permitted (eFigure S1) in the ranibizumab group for “failure” or
“futility”.
In the PRP group, PRP for PDR was initiated at baseline (see Table S1 for PRP procedure).
If the NV size or amount increased following completion of PRP, additional PRP could be
given. In both groups, vitrectomy for vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment was at
investigator discretion, and could include intraoperative PRP.
DME—DME was defined for the protocol as a thickened OCT central subfield (Table S1) at
least 2 standard deviations beyond the gender-specific and instrument-specific norm for the
population and a visual acuity letter score ≤78 (~Snellen equivalent 20/32 or worse). Eyes
not meeting both criteria were considered not to have DME for purposes of the protocol.
Eyes in both treatment groups with DME could receive ranibizumab provided by the study.
At randomization, ranibizumab was required for eyes with DME. Otherwise, initiation and
retreatment with ranibizumab for DME and application of focal/grid photocoagulation for
DME was at investigator discretion. A follow-up visit and retreatment regimen for DME was
provided as a guideline, melded with protocol retreatment and follow-up visits for PDR.15
The primary outcome was mean change in visual acuity letter score from baseline to 2 years.
Secondary efficacy outcomes included visual acuity area under the curve, change in visual
field total point score, central subfield thickness change, DME development, and proportion
of eyes without PDR on fundus photographs. Pre-specified adverse events related to diabetic
retinopathy included vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, vitrectomy, neovascular
glaucoma, and iris neovascularization. Pre-specified additional safety outcomes assessed
included endophthalmitis, ocular inflammation, cataract surgery, serious adverse events,
hospitalizations, death, Antiplatelet Trialists’ Collaboration events, and events in each
MedDRA system organ class.
Statistical Methods
Sample size estimate for the primary outcome, change in visual acuity, was 380 eyes for a
non-inferiority margin of 5 letters, type I error of 2.5% and 85% power (Table S1). The noninferiority hypothesis was tested by determining whether the one end of a 2-sided 95%
confidence interval excluded the non-inferiority margin. If ranibizumab was found non-

inferior to prompt PRP, the same 2-sided 95% confidence interval would be used to test
ranibizumab superiority. The non-inferiority margin was selected, in part, because it was the
same margin used in a prior trial evaluating anti-VEGF agents for neovascular age-related
macular degeneration.16 The Protocol Development Committee (see Acknowledgments)
believed a true difference exceeding 5.0 letters represented a clinically important
difference.17
The primary analysis for comparison between treatments of mean change in visual acuity
followed the intention-to-treat principle and included all randomly assigned eyes with
multiple imputation by the Markov chain Monte Carlo method to impute missing 2-year
visual acuities. Imputation for 2-year visual acuities was based on treatment group, baseline
visual acuity, baseline central subfield thickness, and all visual acuity data from the 16weekly visits. Within group means were based on observed data unless otherwise specified.
Treatment group differences, confidence intervals, and p-values were estimated using
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusting for baseline visual acuity and randomization
stratification factors (baseline central subfield thickness and number of study eyes), with
generalized estimating equations (GEE) used to account for correlation between eyes of
participants contributing 2 eyes. Outlying visual acuity changes were truncated to ±3
standard deviations from the mean. A per-protocol analysis was conducted excluding eyes
not completing the 2-year visit, eyes without PDR on baseline fundus photographs, and eyes
receiving alternate PDR treatment. Model assumptions were evaluated and satisfied.
Sensitivity analyses using transformations, including nonparametric Van der Waerden
normal scores, were conducted.
Pre-planned subgroup analyses repeated the primary ANCOVA, adding subgroup and
subgroup by treatment interactions. Safety analyses and secondary efficacy analyses used
binomial regression, ANCOVA, or the marginal Cox proportional hazards model as
appropriate.18, 19 Within group means for secondary outcomes were based on observed data
unless otherwise specified. Treatment group differences, confidence intervals, and p-values
for secondary outcomes were based on the intention-to-treat cohort. P values and confidence
intervals are two-sided unless otherwise specified. For the primary non-inferiority and
superiority analyses, P values <0.025 (one-sided) or <0.05 (two-sided) were considered
statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Between February and December 2012, 394 study eyes of 305 participants were assigned
randomly to the ranibizumab group (N=191) or the PRP group (N=203). In the ranibizumab
and PRP groups respectively, the median age was 52 (44, 59) and 51 (44, 59) years, 43% and
45% were women, and 52% and 50% were white. Among the eyes in the ranibizumab and
the PRP groups, respectively, mean baseline visual acuity letter score was 75.0 (approximate
Snellen equivalent 20/32) ±12.8 and 75.2 (approximate Snellen equivalent 20/32) ±12.5.
DME at baseline was present in 22% and 23%. Baseline characteristics of the 2 groups
appeared similar (Table 1).

Excluding 14 deaths (including 4 participants with two study eyes), the 2-year visit
completion rate was 88% and 86% in the ranibizumab and PRP groups, respectively (Figure
1). The median (quartiles) number of visits was 22 (18, 24) in the ranibizumab group and 16
(9, 22) in the PRP group. Table S2 reports baseline characteristics by 2-year visit completion
PDR and DME Treatment
Ranibizumab Group—Ninety-seven percent of protocol-required injections based on
clinician interpretation of NV were given. Eyes without DME at baseline (N=133) received a
median (quartiles) of 7 (5, 9) injections through 1 year; eyes without DME at baseline
(N=126) received a median of 10 (6, 13) injections through 2 years (Table S3). Eyes with
DME at baseline (N=36) received 9 (7, 11) injections through 1 year; eyes with DME at
baseline (N=33) received 14 (10, 17) injections through 2 years. Focal/grid laser was
performed in 15 eyes (8%). Through 2 years, 12 eyes (6%) received PRP including 8 during
vitrectomy.
PRP Group—All eyes received initial PRP, 98% received protocol-defined complete PRP
(Table S4). After the completion of PRP, 92 (45%) eyes received additional PRP (median
[quartiles] time from baseline to additional PRP was 221 days).
In addition to PRP, 72 (35%) eyes received ranibizumab for DME at baseline; an additional
36 (18%) received ranibizumab for DME prior to 2 years (Table S5). Among eyes with
baseline DME (N = 46), median (quartiles) number of injections for DME was 5 (3, 9) prior
to 1 year and 9 (4, 15) prior to 2 years. Among eyes without baseline DME (N = 155) that
were later treated for DME, median (quartiles) number of injections was 3 (1, 6) and 4 (2, 7)
prior to 1 and 2 years, respectively. Focal/grid laser was performed in 21 eyes (10%).
Effect of Treatment
Visual Acuity—At 2 years, mean visual acuity letter score improvement from baseline was
+2.8 in the ranibizumab group and +0.2 in the PRP group. The mean treatment group
difference was +2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.5 to +5.0, non-inferiority P<0.001,
Table 2). This result met the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion (the lower bounds of the
95% CI of −0.5 letter was greater than the non-inferiority limit of −5.0 letters). Mean change
in visual acuity letter score over 2 years (area under the curve) was +4.5 compared with −0.3
for the ranibizumab and PRP groups, respectively (mean difference= 4.2 ([95% CI: 3.0 to
5.4]; P< 0.001, Table 2, Figure 2). The difference between groups was greater at 1 year than
at 2 years. Results were similar in per-protocol analyses limited to participants who
completed 2-years (Figure S2, Table S6, treatment group difference +2.1 [95% CI: −0.5,
+4.6]) or eyes with definite baseline PDR on fundus photographs (Table S6). Results were
similar when limiting analyses to participants with two study eyes (Table S7). Sensitivity
analyses using cube transformation (one-sided test for superiority =0.006) and a
nonparametric approach (one-sided test for superiority P =0.013) were similar to overall
results (one-sided test for superiority P=0.053, Table S8). Slight differences in P-values
likely were a result of transformations reducing skewness and thus increasing precision,
however, a priori, the untransformed analysis was designated as primary. Percentages of eyes

with ≥15 letter (Table S9) improvement or worsening (judged clinically relevant when visual
acuity is moderately impaired17) at 2 years and over time (Figure S3 and S4) were similar
between the groups. Percentages of eyes with ≥10 letter worsening (similarly judged
clinically relevant when visual acuity is minimally impaired) also were similar. No
significant interaction of treatment with pre-planned subgroups (Table S10) was identified
except for a possible interaction of visual acuity and prior DME treatment (P=0.02).
Among eyes with DME at baseline, mean change in visual acuity letter score differed
between ranibizumab and PRP by +3.0 (95% CI: −4.2 to 10.3) and +1.4 (95% CI: −1.5 to
4.4; interaction P value = 0.84, Table S10, Table S11, Figure 2B, and Figure 2C) for eyes
without baseline DME.
Other Vision Outcomes—At the 2-year visit, outcomes were better in the ranibizumab
than the PRP group for binocular visual acuity (mean change from baseline +3.4±10.9
versus 0 ±11.8, respectively; difference 3.2 [95% CI: −0.3 to 6.1]; P = 0.03) and visual field
(mean change, combining 30-2 and 60-4 total point score -23±410 dB versus −422±518 dB,
respectively; mean difference 372 dB (95% CI: 213 to 531; P <0.001), Table S12. There
were no statistically significant differences identified in the subscale scores for the National
Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 or University of Alabama-Birmingham Low
Luminescence Questionnaire outcomes (Tables S13 and S14).
Retinal Thickening—At the 2-year visit, among eyes with baseline DME (N=68), central
subfield thickness decreased, on average, by 153±129 μm in the ranibizumab group and by
48±124 μm in the PRP group receiving ranibizumab for DME (adjusted difference = −65μm;
95% CI: −126 to −4.5; P=0.035; Table S15). Among eyes without baseline DME, (N=242),
mean change in central subfield thickness was −18±37 versus +10±54 (difference = −31μm;
95% CI: −41 to −21; P<0.001, Table S15) while the cumulative probability of developing
central DME with vision impairment by 2 years was 9% versus 28% (adjusted difference
19% more frequently in the PRP group, 95% CI: 10% to 28%, P<0.001) in the ranibizumab
and PRP groups, respectively (Figure S5). Changes in retinal volume are in Table S16.
Diabetic Retinopathy—A vitreous hemorrhage developed in 52 eyes (27%) within the
ranibizumab group and 69 eyes (34%) within the PRP group (difference 7% more in the
PRP group, 95% CI: 15% more in the PRP group to 1% more in the ranibizumab group, P =
0.09, Table 2) and a retinal detachment occurred in 6% versus 10%, respectively (difference
4% more in the PRP group, 95% CI: 9% more in the PRP group to 1% more in the
ranibizumab group, P = 0.08). A vitrectomy was performed in 8 (4%) versus 30 (15%) eyes
in the ranibizumab and PRP groups, respectively (difference 9% more in the PRP group,
95% CI: 4% to 15% more in the PRP group, P<0.001), including 2% versus 14% among the
302 eyes without baseline DME and 12% versus 17% among the 88 eyes with baseline
DME. Timing of events related to complications of PDR is in Table S17. Rates of
neovascular glaucoma were 2% in the ranibizumab group and 3% in the PRP group. New
iris neovascularization was 1% in both groups.
Percentages of eyes without active or regressed neovascularization at the disc or elsewhere
on fundus photographs (excluding PRP lesions) at 2 years was 35% among 142 eyes in the

ranibizumab group and 30% among 148 eyes in the PRP group (difference 3%, 95% CI:
−7% to 12%, P=0.58, Table 2). At 2 years, 48% of eyes in the ranibizumab group improved
by 2 or more steps in diabetic retinopathy severity on fundus photographs, an outcome not
assessable after PRP.
Adverse Events
Injection-related endophthalmitis occurred in one eye (0.5%) in the ranibizumab group and
no eyes in the PRP group (0.04% of 2,581 total injections, 0.33% among the 299 eyes
receiving ranibizumab). Ocular inflammation excluding endophthalmitis was reported in 2
(1%) and 9 (4%) eyes in the ranibizumab and PRP groups, respectively, (P = 0.02). Cataract
extraction occurred in 4 (2%) and 12 (6%), respectively (P = 0.06). Additional ocular events
are reported in Table 3.
There were no significant differences identified between groups in the number of
participants with a serious adverse event, hospitalization, death, Antiplatelet Trialists’
Collaboration arteriothromboembolic events (Table 3),20 or events in each individual
MedDRA system organ class (Table S18). However, differences with a P value slightly
greater than the pre-specified cut point of P<0.01 with fewer events in the PRP group were
seen in 6 of 22 system organ classes of cardiac disorders (P = 0.01), endocrine disorders (P =
0.02), infections/infestations (P = 0.02), respiratory disorders (P = 0.04), skin and
subcutaneous tissue disorders (P=0.03), and surgical and medical procedures (P = 0.01).
Table S19 lists all systemic adverse events.
Discussion
In this randomized clinical trial, intravitreous ranibizumab met the primary non-inferiority
outcome of visual acuity change at 2 years being no worse than PRP for treatment of PDR.
A statistically significant visual acuity difference between ranibizumab and PRP was not
present at 2 years, recognizing that 53% of the PRP group received ranibizumab injections
for DME. Ranibizumab resulted in better visual acuity when evaluated over the course of 2
years (area under the curve), although the clinical importance of this difference is unknown.
More peripheral visual field loss occurred (95% CI difference: 213 dB to 531 dB), and more
vitrectomies were performed in the PRP group compared with the ranibizumab group (95%
CI difference: 4% to 15%). Among eyes without center-involved DME at baseline,
development of DME with vision impairment was substantially more frequent in the PRP
group (95% CI difference: 10% to 28%). Only 12 eyes (6%) in the ranibizumab group
received PRP; more than half the eyes in the PRP group received ranibizumab for DME;
thus, the protocol essentially tested ranibizumab for PDR versus PRP plus ranibizumab
when needed for DME treatment.
No systemic safety concerns with ranibizumab were identified in the pre-specified major
safety outcomes. Differences in MedDRA system organ classes of cardiac, endocrine,
infections/infestations, respiratory, skin, or surgical disorders, while not confidently
different, could be real, due to chance, or due to ascertainment bias since the ranibizumab
group had more frequent visits than the PRP group. Interpreting the safety findings is
difficult since a large proportion of the PRP group received ranibizumab for DME. Rates of

endophthalmitis or other injection-related serious adverse events were very low, consistent
with other studies.21–23
Several limitations related to the study design and conduct are important when interpreting
these results. Participant retention through two years (87% of those who had not died) was
lower than desired. Although participants who completed the 2-year visit had slightly better
baseline visual acuities than those who did not, no visual acuity differences between
treatment groups with respect to the 2-year visit completion status were apparent, limiting
the possibility of differential treatment bias. Considering the final visual acuity in the PRP
group, but not in the ranibizumab group, was better for those who did vs. those who did not
complete the 2-year visit, if bias was present, it likely favored the PRP group. The nature of
the treatments precluded masking participants and clinicians. Although DME treatment was
at investigator discretion, the fixed PRP or anti-VEGF regimen for PDR limited clinician
discretion, and protocol treatment adherence was high, limiting the bias of clinician
unmasking except for considering vitrectomy which was at clinician discretion. Visual
acuity testers were masked at the primary outcome visit and the computerized testing
methods minimized acquisition bias.14
Costs, including cost-effectiveness are beyond the scope of this manuscript. It is unknown if
results would have been similar with another anti-VEGF treatment. When designing this
protocol, another trial evaluating ranibizumab for DME had secondary analyses supporting
the potential for ranibizumab to prevent worsening of PDR.23 No such data were available
for aflibercept or bevacizumab at that time. Thus, from a scientific perspective, DRCR.net
investigators judged ranibizumab the best anti-VEGF agent for this trial as enrollment
In applying these results to clinical practice, PRP sometimes can be completed in one visit
and not require additional procedures, although, in this study, 45% needed additional PRP.
PRP may cost less than ranibizumab injections, and carries no risk of endophthalmitis or
systemic anti-VEGF exposure. Weighing the relative benefits of PDR treatment with PRP
versus ranibizumab may be influenced by whether DME is present. When DME is present
for which ranibizumab treatment is planned, PRP may be unnecessary since ranibizumab
will treat both the PDR and DME, assuming access to ranibizumab and patient adherence to
follow-up. Regardless of presence or absence of DME, the results of this study suggest that
ranibizumab is more effective than PRP for mean visual acuity outcomes over the course of
2 years with less visual field loss, and fewer eyes developing DME or undergoing
vitrectomy. Nevertheless, treatment cost, adherence to and frequency of follow-up, and
patient preference should be considered.
Conclusion
Among eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, treatment with ranibizumab resulted in
visual acuity that was non-inferior to (not worse than) panretinal photocoagulation at two
years. Although longer term follow-up is needed, ranibizumab may be a reasonable
treatment alternative at least through 2 years for patients with proliferative diabetic
retinopathy.
