Abstract— Stock price prediction is an important topic in
finance and economics which has spurred the interest of
researchers over the years to develop better predictive models.
The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
models have been explored in literature for time series
prediction. This paper presents extensive process of building
stock price predictive model using the ARIMA model.
Published stock data obtained from New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) and Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) are used with stock
price predictive model developed. Results obtained revealed
that the ARIMA model has a strong potential for short-term
prediction and can compete favourably with existing
techniques for stock price prediction.
Keywords- ARIMA model, Stock Price prediction, Stock
market, Short-term prediction.
INTRODUCTION
Prediction will continue to be an interesting area of
research making researchers in the domain field always
desiring to improve existing predictive models. The reason
is that institutions and individuals are empowered to make
investment decisions and ability to plan and develop
effective strategy about their daily and future endevours.
Stock price prediction is regarded as one of most difficult
task to accomplish in financial forecasting due to complex
nature of stock market . The desire of many
investors is to lay hold of any forecasting method that could
guarantee easy profiting and minimize investment risk from
the stock market. This remains a motivating factor for
researchers to evolve and develop new predictive models
In the past years several models and techniques had been
developed to stock price prediction. Among them are
artificial neural networks (ANNs) model which are very
popular due to its ability to learn patterns from data and
infer solution from unknown data. Few related works that
engaged ANNs model to stock price prediction are .
In recent time, hybrid approaches has also been engaged to
improve stock price predictive models by exploiting the
unique strength of each of them . ANNs is from artificial
intelligence perspectives.
ARIMA models are from statistical models perspectives.
Generally, it is reported in literature that prediction can be
done from two perspectives: statistical and artificial
intelligence techniques . ARIMA models are known to be
robust and efficient in financial time series forecasting
especially short-term prediction than even the most popular
ANNs techniques ( . It has been extensively used in
field of economics and finance. Other statistics models are
regression method, exponential smoothing, generalized
autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH).
Few related works that has engaged ARIMA model for
forecasting includes .
In this paper extensive process of building ARIMA
models for short-term stock price prediction is presented.
The results obtained from real-life data demonstrated the
potential strength of ARIMA models to provide investors
short-term prediction that could aid investment decision
making process.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents brief overview of ARIMA model. Section 3
describes the methodology used while section 4 discusses
the experimental results obtained. The paper is concluded in
section 5.
ARIMA MODEL
Box and Jenkins in 1970 introduced the ARIMA model.
It also referred to as Box-Jenkins methodology composed of
set of activities for identifying, estimating and diagnosing
ARIMA models with time series data. The model is most
prominent methods in financial forecasting .
ARIMA models have shown efficient capability to generate
short-term forecasts. It constantly outperformed complex
structural models in short-term prediction . In ARIMA
model, the future value of a variable is a linear combination
of past values and past errors, expressed as follows:
tY is the actual value and
tε is the random error at t,
θ are the coefficients, p and q are integers that are often
referred to as autoregressive and moving average,
respectively.

The steps in building ARIMA predictive model consist of
model identification, parameter estimation and diagnostic
checking .
METHODOLOGY
The method used in this study to develop ARIMA model
for stock price forecasting is explained in detail in
subsections below. The tool used for implementation is
Eviews software version 5. Stock data used in this research
work are historical daily stock prices obtained from two
countries stock exchanged. The data composed of four
elements, namely: open price, low price, high price and
close price respectively. In this research the closing price is
chosen to represent the price of the index to be predicted.
Closing price is chosen because it reflects all the activities
of the index in a trading day.
To determine the best ARIMA model among several
experiments performed, the following criteria are used in
this study for each stock index.
Relatively small of BIC (Bayesian or Schwarz
Information Criterion)
Relatively small standard error of regression (S.E.
of regression)
Relatively high of adjusted R2
Q-statistics and correlogram show that there is no
significant pattern left in the autocorrelation
functions (ACFs) and partial autocorrelation
functions (PACFs) of the residuals, it means the
residual of the selected model are white noise.
The subsections below described the processes of
ARIMA model-development.
A. ARIMA (p, d, q) Model for Nokia Stock Index
Nokia stock data used in this study covers the period
from 25th April, 1995 to 25th February, 2011 having a total
number of 3990 observations. Figure 1 depicts the original
pattern of the series to have general overview whether the
time series is stationary or not. From the graph below the
time series have random walk pattern.

Figure 2 is the correlogram of Nokia time series. From the
graph, the ACF dies down extremely slowly which simply
means that the time series is nonstationary. If the series is
not stationary, it is converted to a stationary series by
differencing.

“DCLOSE” of Nokia stock index becomes stationary as
shown in figure 3 and figure 4 of the line graph and
correlogram respectively.

In figure 5 the model checking was done with
Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) unit root test on
“DCLOSE” of Nokia stock index. The result confirms that
the series becomes stationary after the first-difference of the

Table 1 shows the different parameters of autoregressive
(p) and moving average (q) among the several ARIMA
model experimented upon . ARIMA (2, 1, 0) is considered
the best for Nokia stock index as shown in figure 6. The
model returned the smallest Bayesian or Schwarz
information criterion of 5.3927 and relatively smallest
standard error of regression of 3.5808 as shown in figure 6.

Figure 7 is the residual of the series. If the model is
good, the residuals (difference between actual and predicted
values) of the model are series of random errors. Since there
are no significant spikes of ACFs and PACFs, it means that
the residual of the selected ARIMA model are white noise,
no other significant patterns left in the time series.
Therefore, there is no need to consider any AR(p) and
MA(q) further.

In forecasting form, the best model selected can be
expressed as follows:

actual value of the series and the forecast value)

B. ARIMA (p, d, q) Model for Zenith Bank Index
The stock data of Zenith bank used in this study covered
the period from 3rd January, 2006 to 25th February, 2011 with
total of 1296 observations. Figure 8 is the original pattern of
the series. From the graph there was upward movement of
the index from 2006 and downward movement is observed
from 2008 possibly because of world financial crisis
experienced at that time.

Figure 9 is the correlogram of the time series of Zenith
bank stock index. From the graph of the correlogram, the
ACF dies down extremely slowly which simply means that
the time series is nonstationary. If the series is not
stationary, there is need to convert to stationary series by
differencing.

“DCLOSE” of Zenith bank stock index becomes stationary
as shown in figure 10 and figure 11 of the line graph and

Table 2 shows the different parameters of autoregressive
(p) and moveing average (q) of the ARIMA model in order
to get the best fitted model. ARIMA (1, 0, 1) is relatively
the best model as indicated in figure 13. The model returned
the smallest Bayesian or Schwarz information criterion of
2.3736 and relatively smallest standard error of regression
of 0.7872 as shown in figure 13.

bank index.
Figure 14 is the correlogram of residual of the seies. From
the figure it is obvious there is no significant spike of ACFs
and PACFs. This means that the residual of this selected
ARIMA model are white noise. There is no other significant
patterns left in the time series and there is no need for
further consideration of another AR(p) and MA(q).

With the results obtained ARIMA models can compete
reasonably well with emerging forecasting techniques in
short-term prediction.
