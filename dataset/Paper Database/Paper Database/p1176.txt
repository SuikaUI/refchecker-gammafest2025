Deep learning methods have shown promise in unsupervised domain adaptation, which aims to leverage a labeled
source domain to learn a classiﬁer for the unlabeled target
domain with a different distribution. However, such methods typically learn a domain-invariant representation space
to match the marginal distributions of the source and target
domains, while ignoring their ﬁne-level structures. In this
paper, we propose Cluster Alignment with a Teacher (CAT)
for unsupervised domain adaptation, which can effectively
incorporate the discriminative clustering structures in both
domains for better adaptation. Technically, CAT leverages
an implicit ensembling teacher model to reliably discover
the class-conditional structure in the feature space for the
unlabeled target domain. Then CAT forces the features of
both the source and the target domains to form discriminative class-conditional clusters and aligns the corresponding clusters across domains. Empirical results demonstrate
that CAT achieves state-of-the-art results in several unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios.
1. Introduction
Deep learning has achieved remarkable performance in a
wide variety of computer vision tasks, such as image recognition and object detection . However, classiﬁers
trained on speciﬁc datasets cannot always generalize effectively to new datasets owing to the well-known domain
shift problem . Enabling models to generalize from
a source domain to a target domain is usually referred to
as domain adaptation (DA) . In many cases, it is expensive or difﬁcult to collect annotations on the target domain. Learning algorithms attempting to tackle the transferring problem from a fully labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain is called unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) . UDA is particularly challenging because
the target domain cannot provide explicit information to facilitate the adaptation of classiﬁers.

Figure 1: (Best viewed in color.) Left: The two domains
have diverse modes. Right: The two domains have different class imbalance ratios. Existing methods aligning the
marginal distributions while ignoring the class-conditional
structures cannot perform well in these cases. However,
CAT incorporates the discriminative clustering structures
in both domains for better adaptation, thus delivers a more
reasonable domain-invariant cluster-structure feature space
with enhanced discriminative power. See Fig. 3 and Appendix. A for the learned feature space of real data.
deep models have been developed with
promise in unsupervised domain adaptation to learn expressive features . These deep
UDA methods mainly focus on matching the source and target domains via adversarial training or kernelized training . The main hypothesis behind them is that the marginal distributions of the two
domains can be aligned in some feature space learned by
optimizing a deep network, and thus the classiﬁer trained
with source data tends to perform well on the target domain.
Theoretical analysis also shows that minimizing the divergence between the marginal distributions in the learned
feature space is beneﬁcial to reduce the classiﬁer’s error.
However, these methods are not problemless. In classiﬁcation, as the classes correspond to different semantics
and different characteristics, the marginal distribution of the
data naturally has a class-conditional multi-modal structure.
Moreover, the modes corresponding to the same class in different domains are not always geometrically similar. Thus,
it is not sufﬁcient for existing deep UDA methods to only
minimize the discrepancy between the marginal distributions while neglecting their structures, and such methods
tend to fail in challenging cases, such as those in Fig. 1.
 
Properly incorporating this ﬁne-grained class-conditional
structure has been shown beneﬁcial in various tasks. For
example, Shi and Sha make the discriminative clustering assumption which helps to adapt the decision boundaries for the source domain to the target domain discriminatively.1 However, one limitation of is that it adopts
a simple linear transformation to learn the feature space,
which cannot effectively extract high-order features from
raw data (e.g., images) as the deep UDA methods. Another
limitation is that builds a nearest neighbor based prediction model, which outputs the prediction of one sample
based on all the source data. Then, the training is not compatible with the stochastic training of deep network and has
a high complexity.
In this paper, we present Cluster Alignment with a
Teacher (CAT), a new deep UDA model that incorporates
the class-conditional structures for more effective adaptation. CAT conjoins the complimentary advantages of deep
learning methods and discriminative clustering methods for
UDA. Technically, there are three learning objectives in
CAT. At ﬁrst, CAT minimizes the supervised classiﬁcation
loss on the labeled source data and builds a teacher classiﬁer, i.e. an implicit ensemble of the source classiﬁer, to
provide pseudo labels for unlabeled target data. The underlying notion is that the golden classiﬁer trained on source
domain can perform well on a majority of target samples
because of the similarity between the two domains and the
teacher-student paradigm is not sensitive to the false pseudo
labels . To exploit the ﬁne-grained class-conditional
structures in the feature space and address the aforementioned issues suffered by existing deep UDA methods, CAT
also includes two objectives which depend on the pseudo
labels provided by the teacher classiﬁer. On one hand, for
discriminative learning in both domains, CAT deploys a
class-conditional clustering loss to force the features from
the same class to concentrate together and the features from
different classes to be separated. On the other hand, for
the class-conditional alignment between the two domains,
CAT aligns the clusters which correspond to the same class
but come from different domains via a conditional feature
matching loss. The prediction models used in CAT are a
student deep network and its implicit ensemble (i.e., the
teacher classiﬁer), thus CAT can address the training issues
of and also enjoy the more ﬂexible ability of feature
learning. Furthermore, it is obvious that CAT is compatible to the marginal distribution alignment methods on the
tasks where the source data is similarly distributed as the
target data. The former can provide a ﬁne-grained classconditional alignment of domains and the latter can provide
a global alignment of them.
1Besides UDA tasks, previous work has also shown an interesting
exploration of the class-conditional structures for learning deep models
that are robust against adversarial attacks.
We evaluate the proposed CAT through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Empirical
results show that CAT presents striking performance across
various tasks. In addition, we further combine CAT with the
existing deep UDA methods, and CAT can bias them successfully to achieve the discriminative alignment between
domains, establishing new state-of-the-art baselines on popular benchmarks. In the combined methods, we also propose a conﬁdence-thresholding technique to ﬁlter out lowconﬁdence target samples (which are likely to be mapped
into incorrect clusters by the marginal distribution alignment methods) to enhance the stability of the training.
To summarize, our contributions are three-folds:
• We exploit the discriminative class-conditional structures of distributions in deep UDA and propose CAT
to achieve better alignment between the source domain
and the target domain.
• CAT is compatible and applicable to the existing UDA
methods which rely on marginal distribution alignment.
• Empirically, CAT is not sensitive to hyper-parameters
and can boost the marginal distribution alignment approaches signiﬁcantly, achieving new state-of-the-art
across various settings.
2. Related work
Unsupervised domain adaptation has drawn increasing
interests, and has been developed mainly in two directions:
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) based approaches
and adversarial training based approaches. Tzeng et al. 
and Long et al. minimize MMD to match the two domains while proposes to align the joint distributions
of them using Joint MMD criterion.
Since the development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) ,
adversarial training has been applied into domain adaptation and fruitful works emerge. Ganin et al. develop
the framework of domain adversarial training and plenty of
works are proposed to improve it by aligning source domain
and target domain better in the feature space 
or image space .
Zhang et al. successfully extend RevGrad to consider each domain’s characteristics
using collaborative games. Image to image translation approaches also play an important role in
the advancement of domain adaptation and demonstrate impressive performance, especially on semantic segmentation
tasks. In addition, Saito et al. propose to align the two
domains using decision boundaries of task-speciﬁc classi-
ﬁer. Associative DA proposes an associative loss to
reduce discrepancy between domains and SimNet proposes to use a similarity-based classiﬁer in UDA. Though
the existing methods match the two domains in different
ways, most of them ignore the class-conditional information
in the alignment procedure, thus hard to attain the objective of discriminative learning. Conversely, CAT explicitly
discovers classes in the feature space via a teacher model
and hence constructs a more reasonable matching procedure. Concurrently, several works analyze the conditional distribution shift and label distribution shift issues
in UDA theoretically, but only propose limited solutions. In
contrast, we provide a more practical and more powerful
way to solve them.
Using a teacher model for labeling data is inspired by the
impressive consistency-based methods in semi-supervised
learning (SSL) .
Recent attempts to apply SSL
techniques in UDA include . CAT differs from
these previous works in that CAT exploits the discriminative class-conditional structures in both the alignment and
classiﬁcation procedures while they focus on improving the
classiﬁer for the target domain by implementing the cluster
assumption . CAT imposes a much stronger regularization and assists in a better alignment.
3. Methodology
In this section, we ﬁrst introduce the setting and framework of deep UDA and then present the Cluster Alignment
with a Teacher (CAT). Finally, we discuss about CAT.
3.1. Deep unsupervised domain adaptation
In an UDA task, we are given a set of source samples Xs = {xi
i=1 with labels Ys = {yi
{1, 2, ..., K} and a set of unlabeled target samples Xt =
i=1. Notably, the two sets of samples are drawn from
different distributions which lead to the domain shift challenge. Therefore, the UDA algorithms should learn to adapt
the classiﬁer trained on the source domain to the unlabeled
target domain. Deep learning techniques have been introduced into UDA and they
demonstrate remarkable performance across tasks. Generally, in these methods, the classiﬁer h (parameterized by θ)
is constructed as h = g ◦f where f maps samples into
features in the space F and g outputs the predictions based
on the extracted features. The learning includes simultaneously optimizing the classiﬁer h w.r.t. the labeled source
data and minimizing the distance between the marginal distributions of the two domains in the feature space F, resulting in a domain-invariant feature space. Technically, in the
source domain, we minimize the supervised loss as:
Ly(Xs, Ys) = 1
where ℓis a pre-deﬁned loss, e.g., cross-entropy loss. Meanwhile, we minimize the discrepancy loss as:
Ld(Xs, Xt) = D(f(Xs, θ), f(Xt, θ)),
where D is a distance and usually correlated with the H∆H
distance in the error bound theory of DA . The theory reveals that the expected error on target samples of any classiﬁer h drawn from a hypothesis set H has the following
bound :
ϵt(h) ≤ϵs(h) + 1
2dH∆H(s, t)
(ϵs(ˆh, ls) + ϵt(ˆh, lt))
≤ϵs(h) + 1
2dH∆H(s, t) + ϵt(ls, lt)
(ϵs(ˆh, ls) + ϵt(ˆh, ls)),
where ϵs(h) denotes the expected error on source samples
of h, and ls and lt represent the labelling functions for
the source and target domains, respectively. ϵt(ls, lt) denotes the disagreement between the labelling functions in
the target domain. Notably, minˆh∈H(ϵs(ˆh, ls) + ϵt(ˆh, ls))
can be small enough by optimizing ˆh w.r.t.
the labeled
source data. The supervised loss and discrepancy loss focus
on minimizing ϵs(h) and dH∆H(s, t) respectively to obtain
small target domain classiﬁcation error.
However, the methods working in the above framework
are not problemless. Theoretically, they ignore minimizing
ϵt(ls, lt) which may lead to a large upper bound of ϵt(h)
and result in unsatisfying target domain performance .
Empirically, the data in classiﬁcation naturally has a classconditional multi-modal structure, thus aligning marginal
distributions while ignoring the ﬁne-level discriminative
structures of domains may hurt the target classiﬁcation performance (Fig. 1-left). Moreover, these methods may fail
in more practical and challenging problems, e.g. the source
and target domains have obviously different class imbalance
ratios (Fig. 1-right).
3.2. Cluster Alignment with a Teacher
To overcome these issues, we expect to exploit the ﬁnelevel structures in the feature space for discriminative learning and match the class-conditional distributions of source
and target domains to reduce of the mismatching between
ls and lt. Therefore, in the deep UDA scenario, we propose
Cluster Alignment with a Teacher (CAT), a new deep UDA
model for more effective adaptation. Speciﬁcally, for the
objectives of discriminative learning and class-conditional
alignment between domains, we propose a discriminative
clustering loss Lc to force the features of both the source
and the target domains to form discriminative clusters, and
a cluster-based alignment loss La to align the clusters corresponding to the same class in different domains. Given
them, we propose to train CAT by solving the following optimization problem:
Ly + α(Lc + La),
Predictions

loss Ly is omitted for clarity).
where the hyper-parameter α sets a relative trade-off. The
whole framework is shown in Fig. 2. We build a teacher
classiﬁer, i.e. an implicit ensemble of the classiﬁer to be optimized, to provide pseudo labels for the unlabeled target
data. These pseudo labels will be used in Lc and La. We
use stochastically sampled mini-batches in the two objectives and the two classiﬁers make predictions in a forwardpropagation way, thus CAT can be trained more efﬁciently
than . Furthermore, Lc and La optimize the feature
space directly and will be more effective than the nearest
neighbor based clustering loss in . We elaborate Lc and
La in the following sections.
Discriminative clustering with a teacher
For better classiﬁcation and alignment, we propose to discover the class-conditional structures in the feature space
in both the source and the target domains, and then shape
them to be discriminative clusters. In the source domain,
the class-conditional structure is obvious because the data is
fully labeled. Nevertheless, in the target domain, we cannot
obtain the class-conditional structure easily due to the lack
of labels. The semantic similarity between the two domains
implies that the classiﬁer h trained on the source domain can
predict most of target samples correctly. Consequently, using pseudo labels as the annotations for target data and
conducting self-training is a direct approach, but it suffers
from the error ampliﬁcation issue which can be detrimental
to the learning procedure. To discover the class-conditional
structure of the target features in a reliable way, we introduce a teacher classiﬁer ˜h deﬁned as an implicit ensemble
of the previous student classiﬁer h to provide pseudo
labels for target data.
Based on the pseudo labels given by the teacher, we can
explicitly force the target class-conditional structure to be
more discriminative using a clustering loss. For the source
domain, a similar one can be applied. Formally, resembling
the effective SNTG loss in , we employ the following
discriminative clustering loss (we omit the dependence of f
on θ for clarity, unless stated otherwise):
Lc(Xs, Xt) = Lc(Xs) + Lc(Xt),
 f(xi), f(xj)
(1 −δij) max
 f(xi), f(xj)
where d is the distance (e.g., squared Euclidean distance)
between two features, m is a pre-deﬁned margin, and δij is
an indicator function which outputs 1 only if xi and xj have
the same ground truth label (source domain) or teacherannotated label (target domain).
Lc encourages the features from the same class to concentrate together and pushes
the features from different classes far away from each other
with a distance m at least. This loss modiﬁes the structures
in the representation space gradually, and consequently, it
demonstrates a class-conditional cluster structure (as shown
in Sec. 4.4). Note that minimizing Lc is consistent with the
cluster assumption of classiﬁer and beneﬁts the performance of classiﬁcation.
It’s a common doubt whether the incorrect predictions
of the teacher classiﬁer would destroy the training dynamics. However, previous works on semi-supervised learning have validated that this kind of training always leads to good convergence and demonstrates robustness against incorrect labels.
Intuitively, the teacher instructs the training of one instance through a bundle of others’ predictions which alleviates the negative inﬂuence of
incorrect predictions notably and aids the student to give
better predictions.
Cluster alignment via conditional feature matching
Once the feature space presents discriminative cluster structure, the classiﬁer is expected to make more accurate predictions. However, the label predictor g trained on source domain features may fail due to the geometrical mismatching
between the clusters which correspond to the same class in
different domains. This kind of mismatching is brought by
the individual characteristics of each domain. As a result,
it is necessary to impose a class-conditional alignment of
two domains to learn better domain-invariant features and
adjust the target feature space to be more suitable for classiﬁcation. Naturally, we expect to minimize the divergence
between the corresponding clusters in source domain and
the teacher-annotated target domain:
D(Fs,k||Ft,k),
where Fs,k (Ft,k) denotes the set consisting of all the features belonging to class k of domain s (domain t). Extensive previous works have been proposed to minimize
the distance between two sets of samples but we expect to
achieve this in a more simple and efﬁcient way by exploiting
the separable and tight clusters in the feature space. Drawing inspiration from feature matching GANs which optimizes the distance between the ﬁrst-order statistics of distributions and demonstrates striking results on SSL tasks,
we choose to extend it to work in a conditional way. Formally, we introduce the following cluster alignment loss:
La(Xs, Xt) = 1
∥λs,k −λt,k ∥2
where λs,k and λt,k are calculated by
s), λt,k =
where Xs,k is the subset of Xs containing all the source
samples whose ground-truth labels are k and Xt,k is the
subset of Xt including all the target samples annotated as
class k by the teacher classiﬁer ˜h. This loss is slightly different from the original feature matching loss: it matches
the statistics of the representation space F which totally
determine the predictions instead of those produced by an
extra critic network. Arguably, the objective has a local optima where class-conditional distributions are matched thoroughly. The cluster alignment loss and the discriminative
clustering loss work together to align the class-conditional
structures of the two domains in a discriminative way.
Improved marginal distribution alignment
In fact, the source domain and target domain in the existing
popular UDA tasks (e.g., digits adaptation and Ofﬁce-31)
have analogous marginal distributions. Therefore, in these
experiments, we combine CAT with the marginal distribution alignment methods, and CAT contributes to bias them
to match the cluster-based marginal distributions. The negative effects of these methods of ignoring the discriminability
may hurt the stability of training and the capability of converged models. For example, several target circle samples
in Fig. 1-left will be misclassiﬁed by them.
We are dedicated to delivering a technique to improve
these models given the observation that in the early stages of
training, a portion of target samples lie around the decision
boundaries of the adapted classiﬁer, i.e., they have low classiﬁcation conﬁdence (the largest output probability) and are
likely to be misclassiﬁed. Therefore, these samples are possible to be mapped into the incorrect clusters in the marginal
alignment process and the training falls into local optima.
To solve this, we propose to use conﬁdence-thresholding
method to hold out uncertain data points with conﬁdence
less than p, while aligning the conﬁdent instances which
are more geometrically close to the source domain with the
source data. Formally, we instantiate this technique in the
typical and brief RevGrad and propose robust RevGrad
(rRevGrad) which optimizes the following loss:
Ld(Xs, Xt) = 1
where c is the critic model parameterized by φ and γi is an
indicator function which outputs 1 only if teacher’s conﬁdence of xi
t is greater than p. With the divergence between
the two domains decreasing, more and more target samples
are selected into the domain adversarial training. Gradually,
almost all the target samples are included in the training
which avoids the lost of target information. We empirically
observed that rRevGrad improves the classiﬁcation performance on the target domain and enhances the stability of
training (see Sec.4).
3.3. Discussion
Comparison with SSL based deep UDA methods . CAT not only implements of cluster assumption
for better classiﬁcation but also imposes a class-conditional
alignment between domains which is more principal in
UDA. However, focus on improving classiﬁer
to make it more consistent and robust for the target domain
based on cluster assumption. Thus CAT is compatible to
these methods (see Sec. 4).
Comparison with MSTN . The cluster alignment
loss using conditional feature matching technique is similar
to the semantic loss in MSTN . However, in MSTN,
minimizing distance between centers is necessary but not
sufﬁcient to achieve semantic alignment. In CAT, we regularize the features to form separable and tight clusters, so
the feature matching based loss can match the clusters naturally. They are also different in implementation.
Mini-batch stochastic training of CAT. We implement
the two objectives in CAT using stochastically sampled
mini-batches as Xs and Xt. Speciﬁcally, Lc is an instancewise loss and can work well. The class-conditional expectation λs,k or λt,k in Lc could be none when these is no points
belonging to class k. At this time, we remove the term corresponding to class k in Eq. 8 and calculate the mean of the
other terms. We empirically ﬁnd CAT needs only 0.05×
more training time on a GTX 1080Ti when combining with
existing methods.
Teacher-student paradigm. First, using teacher as labeling function on target domain avoids the error ampliﬁcation issue. Furthermore, once the classiﬁer becomes more
accurate on the target domain, the teacher classiﬁer performs better as well. Then the pseudo labels used in Lc
and La are more likely to be correct which in turn enhances
the classiﬁer. Consequently, a boosting cycle between them
is formed.
4. Experiments
To demonstrate the effectiveness of CAT, we evaluate
it through various experiments on synthetic imbalanced
dataset and three challenging UDA tasks: SVHN-MNIST-
USPS, Ofﬁce-31 and ImageCLEF-DA2. We show that
CAT considers and exploits the ﬁne-level class-conditional
structures of the source and target domains, and makes the
learned feature space discriminative and aligned, thus yielding improved performance on the target domain.
Datasets and conﬁgurations. SVHN-MNIST-USPS is a
challenging adaptation task of digits between three datasets
SVHN , MNIST and USPS. We conduct experiments in three directions: SVHN→MNIST, MNIST→USPS
and USPS→MNIST. We follow the protocol in : we
use the whole training sets for the adaptation from SVHN
to MNIST and randomly sample 2000 images from MNIST
and 1800 images from USPS for the adaptation between the
two datasets. Following MSTN , the images are cast
to 28 × 28 × 1 when using LeNet as classiﬁer. When
combining with MCD and VADA , We take the
identical settings as the original methods.
Imbalanced SVHN-MNIST-USPS. We randomly sample
1000 instances from class 0 and 100 instances from class 1
from the original source domain and construct a new one.
Then we sample 100 instances from class 0 and 1000 instances from class 1 from the target domain to form a new
target. Therefore, the synthetic adaptation dataset contains
several imbalanced two-class adaptation tasks. The experiment settings are the same as those of SVHN-MNIST-USPS.
Ofﬁce-31 and ImageCLEF-DA are two real-world
datasets which are widely used in domain adaptation research. Ofﬁce-31 is composed of three domains: Amazon
(A), DSLR (D) and Webcam (W), containing 2817, 498 and
795 images from 31 categories, respectively. ImageCLEF-
DA includes three domains: Caltech-256 (C), ImageNet
ILSVRC 2012 (I) and Pascal VOC 2012 (P), containing 600
images from 12 classes, respectively. We use data augmentation such as random ﬂipping and cropping in training for
fair comparison with the baselines.
Implementation. In synthetic and digits experiments
using LeNet, we set m = 30 according to the performance of CAT on the synthetic dataset and we forwardpropagate a target sample twice under different perturbations(i.e., dropout) and use the latter as the prediction of the
teacher for its simplicity (similar with the Π model of ).
In all the other experiments, we ﬁx m = 3 and deploy a tem-

the used architectures and optimization settings.
4.1. Experiments on imbalanced SVHN-MNIST-USPS
We ﬁrst test CAT on the imbalanced SVHN-MNIST-
USPS dataset, a challenging task where the source domains
have 10 : 1 ratio of class imbalance while the target domains
have 1 : 10. We implement CAT and RevGrad based on
the ofﬁcial codes of MSTN using LeNet . The results are shown in Table 1. We repeat each task 3 times and
report the averaged test accuracy and standard deviation.
It is notable that RevGrad and MSTN fail thoroughly owing to their obsession of matching the marginal
distributions. In contrast, CAT gives almost completely correct predictions for the target domains. This experiment veriﬁes that existing methods through aligning marginal distributions are restrictive and require the modes corresponding
to the same class but different domains to be geometrically
similar. They are sensitive and fragile in practical tasks.
4.2. SVHN-MNIST-USPS digits datasets
We apply CAT to the popular digits adaptation task
SVHN-MNIST-USPS and compare to the state-of-the-art approaches in Table 3 (all baseline results are taken from related literature). CAT, RevGrad+CAT and rRevGrad+CAT
follow the settings of MSTN using the LeNet . We
implement MCD+CAT and VADA+CAT based on the of-
ﬁcial codes of MCD and VADA using their architectures instead of LeNet for fair comparison. We only
integrate CAT with the ﬁrst stage algorithm VADA in DIRT-
T while discarding the ﬁne-tuning stage for simpleness.
There are several conclusions we can make.
CAT reveals strikingly improved test accuracy on SVHN to
MNIST task without tuning the hyper-parameters, and CAT
even outperforms MCD and VADA which use
much wider and deeper neural networks thanks to the classconditional discriminative alignment between the source
and target domains. This task is the most challenging one
among the three because of the complex samples and the

internal class imbalance of SVHN. Second, CAT does not
perform well enough on the other two tasks but when combining with rRevGrad and MCD , CAT outperforms the
strong baselines MSTN and MCD with obvious
margins. Third, applying CAT into RevGrad , MCD 
and VADA can enhance the base methods signiﬁcantly,
especially on the typical and simple RevGrad . Finally,
rRevGrad+CAT displays higher test accuracy and lower
variance than those of RevGrad+CAT and the advantage is
particularly obvious when the two domains have different
class-conditional structures (e.g., SVHN to MNIST), so we
utilize rRevGrad+CAT on more challenging tasks.
4.3. Experiments on Ofﬁce-31 and ImageCLEF-DA
We evaluate CAT using two sets of extensive experiments on the widely used Ofﬁce-31 and ImageCLEF-DA.
They contain more realistic and high-dimensional images,
providing a good complement to the digits adaptation task.
The results are provided in Table 2 and Table 4, respectively. We integrate CAT with rRevGrad and JAN (using ResNet-50 and AlexNet as the classiﬁers),
which is sufﬁcient to testify the effectiveness of discriminative cluster-based alignment and teacher-student paradigm.
We observe that CAT can boost rRevGrad and JAN 
signiﬁcantly, especially on the difﬁcult A to W, A to D
and D to A tasks in Ofﬁce-31, and the combined models surpass the strong baselines RevGrad and JAN 
by obvious margins. CAT based methods also outperform
MSTN on various tasks substantially which proves the
class-conditional discriminative alignment is superior to the
semantic alignment used by MSTN . The improvement
of test accuracy on most tasks of ImageCLEF-DA shows
that CAT can still work well when the domains are small
containing only 600 images. We further conﬁrm that CAT
can deliver a discriminative and aligned feature space by
visualizing the learned features in the Appendix. A.

expected, using CAT (Fig. 3b), the features are concentrated
and form tight clusters and those from different classes are
separated. In contrast, the features learned by RevGrad 
(Fig. 3a) are more overlapping and less discriminative.
Clustering in the feature space. We further examine
the feature space shaped by CAT and other baselines by
conducting K-means clustering using the aligned features. We utilize the trained models to infer the hidden features of all the images from two domains. Then the features are clustered into k components by K-means in scikitlearn .
We set k as the number of categories.
greedily set the label of a cluster as the most frequent label in it to calculate clustering accuracy as shown in Fig. 4.
As expected, the feature spaces learned by rRevGrad+CAT
demonstrate more discriminative cluster structure and this
is consistent with the classiﬁcation results. Appendix. B, C
and D provide more analyses.
5. Conclusion
In this paper we address the challenges of making better
alignment between domains and advocate to exploit the discriminative class-conditional structures for effective adaptation in deep UDA. We propose Cluster Alignment with a
Teacher (CAT) to achieve the objectives of discriminative
learning and class-conditional alignment via a discriminative clustering loss and a cluster-based alignment loss. CAT
produces a domain-invariant feature space with improved
discriminative power and enhances the performance significantly. CAT establishes new state-of-the-art baselines on
benchmarks and additional analyses testify its effectiveness.
