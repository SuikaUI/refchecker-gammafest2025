Background: The aim of this study is to review the literature on known barriers and solutions that face educators
when developing and implementing online learning programs for medical students and postgraduate trainees.
Methods: An integrative review was conducted over a three-month period by an inter-institutional research team.
The search included ScienceDirect, Scopus, BioMedical, PubMed, Medline (EBSCO & Ovid), ERIC, LISA, EBSCO, Google
Scholar, ProQuest A&I, ProQuest UK & Ireland, UL Institutional Repository (IR), UCDIR and the All Aboard Report. Search
terms included online learning, medical educators, development, barriers, solutions and digital literacy. The search was
carried out by two reviewers. Titles and abstracts were screened independently and reviewed with inclusion/exclusion
criteria. A consensus was drawn on which articles were included. Data appraisal was performed using the Critical
Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Qualitative Research Checklist and NHMRC Appraisal Evidence Matrix. Data
extraction was completed using the Cochrane Data Extraction Form and a modified extraction tool.
Results: Of the 3101 abstracts identified from the search, ten full-text papers met the inclusion criteria. Data
extraction was completed on seven papers of high methodological quality and on three lower quality papers.
Findings suggest that the key barriers which affect the development and implementation of online learning
in medical education include time constraints, poor technical skills, inadequate infrastructure, absence of institutional
strategies and support and negative attitudes of all involved. Solutions to these include improved educator skills,
incentives and reward for the time involved with development and delivery of online content, improved institutional
strategies and support and positive attitude amongst all those involved in the development and delivery of online content.
Conclusion: This review has identified barriers and solutions amongst medical educators to the implementation of online
learning in medical education. Results can be used to inform institutional and educator practice in the development of
further online learning.

Background
Medical education has many long established pedagogical approaches to learning including face to face lectures in classrooms - via a teacher-centred model .
This particular approach to educational practices can
manifest within a teaching culture , becoming pervasive within an organisation or discipline, leading to a reluctance to adopt new and emerging practices and
technologies. Over the last number of decades there has
been a shift in medical education practice from traditional forms of teaching to other media which employ
online, distance or electronic learning . As described
by Howlett et al. , “Electronic (e) or online learning
can be defined as the use of electronic technology and
media to deliver, support and enhance both learning and
teaching and involves communication between learners
and teachers utilising online content”. Online learning
can provide students with “easier and more effective access to a wider variety and greater quantity of information” . However, the transition from traditional to
online learning is not without challenges. Increasing
time constraints and demands are continually placed on
students and educators alike, driving departments to find
new ways of providing a more personalised, self-directed
learning experience.

Medical graduates of the twenty-first century are expected to ‘hit the ground running’ , requiring not only
a traditional clinical education but also one that is
up-to-date with the latest technologies in order to ensure flexibility in a dynamic workplace. There has never
been a greater need for educators, students and clinicians to continuously update their skills, to remain
abreast of the changing healthcare environment and to
remain ‘digitally literate’. Digital literacy has been defined as: (a) ‘The ability to use digital technology, communication tools or networks to locate, evaluate, use
and create information’, (b)‘ The ability to understand
and use information in multiple formats from a wide
range of sources when it is presented via computers.’, (c)
‘Literacy includes the ability to read and interpret media,
to reproduce data and images through digital manipulation, and to evaluate and apply new knowledge gained
from digital environments’ . The advent of mobile devices, Web 2.0, Web 3.0 and more recently Web 4.0 and
the explosion of social media technology provides opportunities for learners to create their own personalised
learning experiences. Academic faculty and tutors therefore have a crucial role in guiding and supporting the
effective use of technology for such learning.
Many factors can influence whether or not an online
learning programme will succeed or fail, ranging from student led factors to staff led factors . For example,
“cultural resistances” amongst staff have previously been
identified as a barrier to student engagement with
technology-based education; therefore, staff focused initiatives may be key to the introduction of successful
e-learning programs . It has also been recognised that
changes and developments in medical education are putting extra pressure on already overworked faculty .
When considering the implementation of e-learning
within a medical school or programme robust evidence
based research may strengthen one’s position when encouraging faculty to remaining abreast of technological
advances. It will aid in addressing underlying concerns
amongst medical faculty who may be resistant to integrating e-learning into teaching practices. In order to ensure a
robust evidence base for, or against, e-learning in medical
education, it is crucial that account be taken of all perspectives (student, educator, training body / school / university). To date there has been no review of the evidence
on barriers and solutions from a medical educator’s perspective but there has been work completed in regards to
the barriers which students face and the solutions to improve engagement with online learning . This review therefore aims to fill this gap in the literature.
Review aims and objectives
The overarching aim of this review was to identify and
synthesize existing literature relating to the barriers and
solutions to the development and implementation of online learning in medical education from a medical educator perspective. The review specifically sought:
 To evaluate existing literature relating to medical
educator experience, digital literacy and/or involvement
with developing and implementing e-learning tools and
programmes
 To identify the barriers and solutions that restrict
and aid e-learning from medical educators’ perspectives
There have been changes and new introductions into
the education of medical educators regarding digital literacy and e-learning tools. These tools as shown have
been developed over time and as there has been no review done so far, this is why we did the review and this
paper. Also, that due to the ever changing nature of
e-learning and skills needed for e-learning, staff need to
develop these skills or be left behind in the digital era.
An integrative review of the literature was conducted in
order to allow for the inclusion of studies with diverse methodologies, such as those with both experimental and nonexperimental designs. The framework
of Whittemore & Knafl was used to enhance the
rigour of the review.
Search strategies
A search strategy was devised with input from the research team which was comprised of the six authors.
The following databases were to be included: Scopus,
BioMedical Central, ERIC, Ebsco and LISA. The search
engine Google Scholar was also used. Grey literature
sources searched included ProQuest Dissertations &
Theses (UK & Ireland), ProQuest Dissertations & Theses
(A&I), University of Limerick Institutional Repository
and University College Dublin Institutional Repository
and a reference list was also searched for relevant studies. Boolean operators (AND, OR) were used and search
terms included “online learning”, “distance learning”,
“medical educators” and “digital literacy”.
The search was completed over a three month period
 by two researchers independently.
Two searches were completed with different search
strings (See Additional file 1) to ensure that all relevant
papers were included. Both authors screened titles and
abstracts independently into a shared online workbook.
Once the initial screening took place authors compared
searches to ensure that results were the same.
The identified abstracts from each search were combined resulting in an overall number of abstracts to be
screened for each database, search engine and grey
O’Doherty et al. BMC Medical Education 18:130
 
literature sources. The researchers used the software
packages Endnote and Mendeley to organise the citations. This review was completed in a two - stage
process; starting with a review of abstracts and titles.
Where these met all inclusion criteria, full text articles
were sourced and retrieved. All full text articles were
then reviewed independently against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Consensus was reached by the research
team on the final list of articles to be included.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
All peer-reviewed journal articles that reported empirical
research, were published in English over a 10 year period
from 2006 to 2016 and that focused on the medical educators’ experience of online / e-learning were included.
Medical educators were defined as those teaching medical students or postgraduate trainees. Studies which
specifically outlined interventions relating to improving
digital literacy skills amongst medical educators were
included. Studies that highlighted interventions designed to impact on engagement with online learning,
the development of content and implementation in
higher-level institutions were included. Qualitative, quantitative and mixed method studies were also included.
Studies that evaluated e-learning / online learning
amongst populations other than medical educators were
excluded. Studies that did not report empirical research
or were not written in the English language were
Data appraisal
Data appraisal was performed by two researchers using
the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Qualitative
Research Checklist for qualitative studies and National
Health Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Appraisal
Evidence Matrix for mixed methods and quantitative research . Quantitative and mixed method studies were
ranked as outlined by Andrew et al. , (i.e. Excellent-A;
Good-B; Satisfactory-C and Poor-4). Qualitative papers
were also ranked according to quality of design (Low/
Medium/High) . All ten papers were included in the
analysis, seven of high quality and three of low quality.
Data extraction
Qualitative data was extracted using Supplementary
Guidance Notes for Inclusion of Qualitative Research in
Cochrane Systematic Reviews of Interventions .
Quantitative and mixed method data was extracted
using an extraction tool, which included aspects of
Noyes et al. guidelines, informed by subject matter
experts within the research team. Two researchers completed the data extraction from the eligible papers independently and reached a consensus on extracted data
following this process.
Data analysis
Thematic analysis was the most appropriate form of data
analysis for the mixed method studies included in this
review. Each article was analysed and deductively coded
under two headings:
1. Barriers to the development and implementation of
online learning
2. Solutions to the barriers to the development and
implementation of online learning.
A thematic worksheet allowed the two authors to analyse and synthesise data under qualitative and quantitative / mixed method studies independently. Thematic
analysis was completed by two researchers manually and
using the software package NVivo 10. Final themes were
agreed by all authors.
Search results
The initial search yielded 3101 abstracts across all
sources (See Additional file 2).
A total of 2210 articles were excluded following first
screening with 114 articles deemed suitable for full text
review (see Fig. 1 flow diagram of study selection).
One hundred and four of these were excluded by not
meeting participant criteria (n = 44), i.e. medical educators; or not reporting empirical research (n = 60). Many
of the excluded studies focused on the student experience of engaging with e-learning programs / distance
education and online learning. Of the 10 studies that
met the inclusion criteria, these were included in final
analysis. Table 1 describes the 10 studies; eight quantitative / mixed methods studies and two qualitative. Data
was extracted using guidelines which included aims
of each study, sampling approach, participant characteristics, data collection methods and data analysis approach
(see Table 1 Outline of studies included in review).
After an iterative process involving the research team,
four main themes emerged. These categories are inclusive of barriers to the development and implementation
of online learning and also offer solutions to those barriers (see Fig. 2 Core themes identified through the coding process).
Core themes
Barrier – Skill deficit Lack of skills, in particular technical
skills, was found to be one of the barriers met by educators
when engaging with the development and implementation of
online learning . Insufficient computer and typing skills
O’Doherty et al. BMC Medical Education 18:130
 
 together with poor infrastructure can inhibit educator’s
willingness or ability to engage with the development
or delivery of online learning .
Solution – Engagement In order to gain the necessary
skills, it was acknowledged that engaging with e-learning,
including the development of such programs, was important for gaining skills for teaching practice .
“I participated so that I could learn a little bit more
about teaching in an electronic environment. I think I
learned quite a bit” 
Perlman et al. argue the importance of providing
faculty with the necessary skills via training provided on
the use of the ePortfolio tool. Workshops allowed faculty
to learn this new skill and gain familiarity with the tool
through use and from instructional design staff who
were present during workshops. In order to ensure the
success of the program it was crucial that faculty received the necessary training on the tool.
Barrier - time Medical educators are already under
pressure to find sufficient time to manage teaching, research and maintain a work life balance personal life
commitments . In this context, inadequate time to
devote to the mastery, development and implementation
of online learning tools can be seen as a significant

barrier. This expectation of time to be invested can be
seen as detrimental in an educator’s own pedagogical
system in conjunction with preconceived notions that
computer based tools “always take longer than expected”
 . Interestingly, lack of time appears to be linked with
lack of incentives to engage with online or e-learning
 . Perlman et al. highlight time as a barrier for
faculty engaging in using an electronic ePortfolio tool.
Faculty members had to invest uncompensated teaching
time as they were not afforded protected administrative
time due to the pilot nature of the program. It was noted
that in order to ensure the effective use of such a teaching instrument, it is crucial that educators are afforded
the time to become familiar with and engage with this
type of tool. Faculty spent on average four to five half
days of clinical work in preparing and using the tool.
Solution - time The adoption of digital tools can, in
fact, free up time allowing medical educators to learn
concepts and to reflect on practices . Furthermore,
where educators are asked to spend time engaging with
the development or implementation of online learning it
is proposed that there be a ‘formal mechanism for faculty
reward and acknowledgement for efforts…‘ .
Barrier - infrastructure In many instances, the lack of
infrastructure and technology can be seen as a barrier in
medical education, typically in low-medium income
countries . Many of these countries lack technological
basics, such as email, while others comment on the poor
quality of services, such as intermittent internet access
or photocopying. These technological limitations can act
as a barrier to e-learning within a faculty and geographical context . For example Attardi & Rogers identified technical issues such as poor internet connectivity
as barriers to live broadcasting of lectures in their institution in Canada. Bediang et al. highlight how poor
internet connectivity, Wi-Fi and access to physical infrastructure are issues which are faced in a low-income
country such as Cameroon. Lakbala’s study also
highlights the different barriers met by health profession
educators in implementing e-learning in a low-income
country such as Iran. Barriers identified include limited
access to computers and poor physical infrastructure.
Solution - cost Maloney et al. found that where a
break-even analysis is completed to determine the true
cost of a web-based education, the web-based approach
was ‘robustly superior than a traditional face-to-face
education, allowing lower number of enrolments for a
program to reach its break-even point’. While this analysis might not always be an approach adopted by medical schools in developing an online programme, it is
suggested as one of the ways in which one might look at
the cost of establishing the correct infrastructure not as
a barrier but as a potential solution to a barrier.
Institutional strategies & support
Barrier –poor communication Where there was a lack
of institutional support and limited direction as to how
tools or programs would be implemented, implementation was rarely successful .
“It was felt that in the early stages of the Faculty of
Health, many projects were begun but the structure
was missing within the Faculty to see them through” 
Implementing
e-learning
process which is adopted in polarisation; while the
adoption of e-learning tools may be taking place
across a number of departments in an institution, there
may be a lack of interdepartmental communication which
is seen as a barrier.
“We can’t work alone! We need to work as a team” 
The asynchronous environment generated is perceived
as one which does not support the active exchange of
ideas and shared knowledge.
“I have found it difficult at times to have a ‘discussion’
online as you are never quite sure about the exact
meaning of what people are saying.” 
Solution - collaboration Bediang et al. found that
one of the most important ways in which implementation of online / e-learning programs can be completed
successfully is to include all relevant stakeholders and
departments within a faculty and for new approaches to
be adopted to facilitate collaboration. They specifically
outlined the need for e-learning managers to put appropriate mechanisms in place in order to ‘i) have qualified
Fig. 2 Core themes identified through the coding process
O’Doherty et al. BMC Medical Education 18:130
 
and dedicated human resources, ii) allocate financial
resources and iii) support of all stakeholders according to their needs’. Perlman et al. noted that the
provision of institutional support to faculty so that
they might continue to participate in the development
of online programs and for its future success is
imperative.
An institutional strategy is therefore required which
facilitates the implementation of key skills and the adoption of methodologies by faculty when implementing
online learning .
Barrier – Attitude Negative attitude amongst educators
in engaging with new technologies and tools can be seen
as a barrier to the development and implementation of
online learning. Educators noted feeling overwhelmed
with the entire process of engaging with new tools 
and having little patience for navigating minor technical
issues .
“If you ask me to peer-review something that I have no
expertise in I’m reluctant to do that” 
Such feelings of inadequacy, stemming from limited
knowledge of, or proper training with, a particular tool
may be influencing the attitude of some educators when
asked to commit to implementing and developing online
learning practices.
Solution - culture Maintaining a positive attitude in the
face of seemingly difficult to use and time consuming
e-learning tools and technologies can be quite problematic. Educators involved in one study noted that it was
important to try to maintain a positive attitude .
“Try to maintain a positive attitude and assume that
any slights or overly harsh criticism is due to the
asynchronous communication and to not take
itpersonally” 
Adopting these new tools may in fact produce a positive experience overall and even break down preconceived notions;
“I guess the interesting thing is that I’m old and you
can teach an old dog new tricks” 
Fostering a change of norms and attitudes therefore is
an important solution in the development and implementation of online learning in medical education.
Discussion
This review has thematically synthesized evidence of key
barriers and solutions to the development and implementation of online learning from the medical educator’s
perspective. These included skills, resources, institutional strategies and support and attitude with similar
themes across many studies. This highlights the ubiquity
of barriers to online learning across diverse medical education systems and speaks to a shared history of
attempting to overcome them.
While positive experiences were identified, with some
educators commenting on the fact that they enjoyed engaging with new tools , there was firm emphasis
on the need for strong institutional support behind such
developments. Where there was a lack of institutional
support and limited direction as to how such tools or
programs would be implemented, implementation was
rarely successful . A clear institutional strategy therefore is recommended when implementing online learning . There is also a strong need for inter-faculty
collaboration to ensure that a cohesive education is
available for learners . Many of the themes identified in this review compliment previous studies in health
profession education. For example Childs et al. , discussed the barriers and solutions to effective e-learning
for health professionals and students and identified technical skills as both a barrier and a solution. Poor educator skills was also noted as a barrier by Pettersson &
Olofsson . Where issues surrounding lack of training
are identified, one of the solutions proposed by Childs et
al. is the introduction (or improvement) of such
training. Childs et al. also went so far as to recommend
the enforcement of a basic computer literacy policy .
Pettersson & Olofsson’s study also references time as a
barrier to the implementation of e-learning technologies
 . They noted that there is limited time available for
faculty to learn these new technologies which in effect
damages self-confidence. The lack of time available also
made faculty concerned about the pedagogical and organisational aspects of distance teaching. In order to
allow educators the necessary time to learn new technologies, institutions should allow for protected time for
educators to develop these skills, learn concepts and reflect on practices .
The increasing use of ‘inverted’ or ‘flipped classrooms’
within medical education has led to discussion on the
potential of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) integration into medical training. The shift from lecture
based class to the use of Massive Open Online Courses
(MOOCs) and the availability of open access resources
pose a teaching challenge with maintaining tradition
often being a barrier in adopting online learning approaches by educators. Petit dit Dariel et al. argues
that the ‘resistance to change’ argument around e-learning
O’Doherty et al. BMC Medical Education 18:130
 
technology is too simplistic. It is important to look at the
intrinsic motivations that spur health professionals to either adopt or reject e-learning and how best to address
these issues within specific disciplines. Specific concerns
should also be recognised by institutions and departments
to ensure faculty have a deeper understanding of why the
change to teaching approaches is necessary and beneficial
to all involved.
Limitations of the review
There are limitations within this study which need to be
acknowledged.
While four key themes, with a number of subthemes,
were identified, the researchers are aware this may not
be exhaustive of all the potential barriers facing medical
educators engaging with online learning nor all the dominant solutions available. Despite rigorous search methodologies, it is possible that some studies were missed
by the nature of the search strings used, if the keywords
did not appear in the title or abstract.
Furthermore, one of the issues faced by researchers
when using the database Medline (Ovid) was that of replicability. Two researchers, searching independently found
conflicting results using the same search strategy and inclusion / exclusion criteria. This is a noted phenomenon
as discussed by Younger & Boddy where it was found
that different interfaces can have an impact on the number of hits retrieved from the same database. In this instance, the team concluded that results from both
searches for this database would be combined.
Recommendations for further research
Specific themes highlighted in this review such as attitude and the importance of technical skills indicate a
need for a rigorous mixed methods study focusing on
the digital literacy skills of both medical educators and
students. The next step in this research therefore will include a national prospective study exploring medical educators’ and medical students’ digital literacy skills
within an Irish medical education setting.
Implications for educators
Online learning has implications for educators who
chose to teach via this modality including increased responsibility, the need to alter teaching style and the need
to maintain meaningful ongoing communication .
The barriers and solutions to online learning identified in
this review highlight the need for significant “buy-in” from
individual educators when encouraging a move to online
learning. There is a need for medical educators to gain a
comprehensive overview of online platforms and technologies and to understand that their own pedagogical
approaches to teaching will in fact need to shift to accommodate the online environment .
It is also clear from the findings that institutional support when promoting this method of learning is of utmost importance and that this support should include
encouraging future developments to ensure that online
learning as a mode of teaching is maintained and updated to reflect the dynamic nature of information technology (IT).
Conclusion
Online learning in medical education is a relatively new
concept and one which is rapidly expanding. It is important therefore that postgraduate training bodies,
medical schools and their educators are aware of the
barriers and solutions to the development and implementation of type of learning and of the need for a culture to be in place which strives to promote and support
the use of online learning amongst staff. In doing so,
medical educators and students will be better prepared
for the challenges faced in this digital age.
