ABSTRACT As a popular clustering algorithms, fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm has been used in various
ﬁelds, including fault diagnosis, machine learning. To overcome the sensitivity to outliers problem and the
local minimum problem of the fuzzy c-means new algorithm is proposed based on the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm and the genetic algorithm (GA). The combined algorithm utilizes the simulated annealing
algorithm due to its local search abilities. Thereby, problems associated with the genetic algorithm, such as
its tendency to prematurely select optimal values, can be overcome, and genetic algorithm can be applied in
fuzzy clustering analysis. Moreover, the new algorithm can solve other problems associated with the fuzzy
clustering algorithm, which include initial clustering center value sensitivity and convergence to a local
minimum. Furthermore, the simulation results can be used as classiﬁcation criteria for identifying several
types of bearing faults. Compare with the dimensionless indexes, it shows that the mutual dimensionless
indexes are more suitable for clustering algorithms. Finally, the experimental results show that the method
adopted in this paper can improve the accuracy of clustering and accurately classify the bearing faults of
rotating machinery.

I. INTRODUCTION
Rotating machinery is the most popular type of equipment used in mechanical engineering industrial applications.
Rolling bearings are one of the most important components
of rotating machinery. However, the rapid developments in
science and technology have increased the complexity of
rotating machinery structures, increasing the probability of
rolling bearing failure . Therefore, rotating machinery

diagnosis for predicting rolling bearing failures is of particular signiﬁcance , . A common fault diagnosis method
is to analyze vibration signals that contain mechanical fault
information , . This method comprises two important
steps: signal feature extraction and fault status identiﬁcation.
Due to the fact that mechanical failures occur gradually, there
is often uncertainty in relation to which vibration signal characteristics should be extracted, and a fault state may not be
identiﬁed from the eigenvalues extracted from the vibration
signals. Thus, an effective way to identify failure modes is
to use fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering based on the fuzzy
theory , .

Signiﬁcant research for rotating machinery fault diagnosis
has been previously conducted, to solve the problem of complex rotating machinery failure. To date, a number of efﬁcient
fault diagnosis methods have been derived. To improve the
dimensionless index classiﬁcation of petrochemical rotating
machinery equipment, a double sample data fusion method
is proposed by Xiong et al. Based on a combination of rules
and raw data collection, each dimensionless index could be
used as the evidence of the system, and then, the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov (K-S) test could be used to detect the exact type
of failure. Their experiments demonstrated successful fault
type identiﬁcation using dimensionless indexes with coincidences or evidence conﬂicts. Compared to the k-nearest
neighbors (KNN) algorithm, this method provided better fault
recognition and improved the fault detection accuracy by
9.45% . Under actual working conditions, serious overlap
problems can occur when the dimensionless parameter range
is deﬁned by vibration monitoring calculations to simulate
compound faults. On this basis, Sun et al. proposed a novel
online method based on dimensionless immune detector and
evidential reasoning (ER) to diagnose rotating machinery.
Their method was able to effectively achieve real-time fault
diagnosis with great potential for practical engineering applications .
FCM is a popular clustering method using the concept of
geometric closeness of the determined data point to classify
data . At present, clustering algorithms are widely used
in different domains, such as mechanical fault diagnosis,
medical data processing, and image processing – .
Wang et al. applied the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm
in mechanical fault diagnosis. The center of the data eigenvalues of rolling bearings was used to distinguish the fault
categories and good results were obtained. However, when
processing complex data, the above algorithm may not be
sufﬁcient when using a certain point as a clustering center
for a certain type of data .
When the data eigenvalues are difﬁcult to be separated,
the number of different types of data differs, or the distance
between different data types is small, it is convenient to shift
the data center point to a category with more data, which
will reduce the accuracy of clustering. In such cases, it is
important to select the initial clustering center point. According to the above analysis, Wu et al. proposed an improved
algorithm, which takes into account two factors, the distance
and the local density, and it was able to get good results .
Zhang et al. gave a FCM algorithm based on a genetic
algorithm (GA). It was shown that when the number of
samples and categories is large, the proposed algorithm can
lead to faster speed and more accurate results than the FCM
algorithm. Bai et al. proposed a fuzzy clustering algorithm
based on simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm.
The above algorithm could overcome the system sensitivity
to data sets and initial clustering centers, and avoid falling
into local minima .
Among the aforementioned algorithms, the optimization
algorithms proposed by Zhang et al. and Bai et al. let the
sum of the distances between the clustering center and the
data points be the ﬁtness function in genetic algorithm. It is
generally believed that the smaller the distance, the higher
the ﬁtness. However, this method may not be appropriate for
processing some complex data types, especially when the
data does not satisfy normal distribution. In addition, this
algorithm is sensitive to outliers.
In addition, semi-supervised clustering, a new learning
method, is proposed in recent years, which combines semisupervised learning and cluster analysis , . The exiting semi-supervised clustering algorithm can be divided into
three class, such as the method based on constraint, the
method based on distance, and the method based on constraint
and distance .
To overcome the shortcoming of the method proposed by
Zhang et al, in this paper, the distance and clustering accuracy
are taken as the ﬁtness function of genetic simulated annealing algorithm. The following contributions are presented:
1) A mutual dimensionless method is used to process
data. The mutual dimensionless index can reduce the distance between the internal structure of each dimensionless
index and the coincidence of the same dimensionless index
of each fault. The experimental results show that, compare
with dimensionless method, the accuracy of bearing fault
diagnosis can be increased by 9.22% at most by mutual
dimensionless processing.
2) Since traditional FCM is very sensitive to outlier, the
clustering accuracy is taken as the objective function, which
is optimized by the genetic simulation annealing algorithm.
3) Several popular intelligent fault diagnosis methods,
including the GA, SA, and FCM clustering algorithm, are
merged to form an integrated diagnosis method for rotating
machinery.
The paper is organized as follows: Section II will introduct
our related work on data processing and fault diagnosis.
Section III provides the FCM clustering theory, the GA and
SA algorithm principles, and the theory of the fusion algorithm applied for single intelligent fault diagnosis. Section IV
presents the experimental procedure, results, and analysis on
the hybrid fault diagnosis method based on the SA and GA
algorithms. Section V provides a general discussion, while a
summary of the study and future directions are presented in
Section VI.

This section describes the related work on data processing of
rotating unit and our previous for fault diagnosis. Our related
works show the feasibility of our algorithm to some extent.
A. RELATED WORK ON DATA PROCESSING
The characteristic signals of the bearing are different, when
the it is in different operational state. The original vibration
signal can be analyzed and processed, which can better meet
the needs of state diagnosis. For example, time domain waveform signal is a kind of original vibration signal without any
processing. Its waveform characteristics are different with
different operation status, as shown in the Fig. 1 to 5,

FIGURE 2. Time-domain waveform of outer-ring wear.
FIGURE 3. Time-domain waveform of inner-ring wear.
However, it is difﬁcult for us to identify the type of the
operation status. Therefore, it is feasible and signiﬁcant to
extract fault feature from time domain signals and dimensional index often used in time domain analysis.
Xiong et al. proposed a method based on the static discount
factor, combining the KNN classiﬁcation algorithm with the
dimensionless index for information fusion fault diagnosis,
and experimental results show the method can reduce the
impact of unreliable factors on the fusion effect. But there
are difﬁculties with distinguishing evidence from complete
fusion or large conﬂicts resulting in uncertainty in the problem diagnosis .
Then, Xiong et al. exchanged numerator and denominator in dimensionless formula, and named it the mutualdimensionless index. It is proved in reference that the
mutual dimensionless index is sensitive enough to the fault
and not affected by the working conditions of the machine,
which is more suitable for the fault diagnosis of rotating

machinery. Accordingly, the mutual dimensionless method is
used to process the data in this paper.
B. RELATED WORK ON FAULT DIAGNOSIS
Xiong et al. proposed SVM and correlation coefﬁcient algorithm to diagnose mechanical bearing, according to the separability and correlation of fault data eigenvalues , .
However, the method of SVM did not solve the problem of
parameters selection, and the method of correlation coefﬁcient has the problem of low diagnosis rate.
Wang et al. used the FCM algorithm to diagnosis mechanical status . The center of data eigenvalues can be obtain
by FCM. However, the method does not overcome the local
minimum problem of FCM. Therefore, this paper improves
the FCM algorithm by using SA and GA.
III. RELATED THEORY
For readability and ease of later development, this section
will describes three algorithms used in the paper, including
fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, genetic algorithm and
simulated annealing algorithm.
A. FUZZY C-MEANS CLUSTERING ALGORITHM
The FCM clustering algorithm is one of most popular clustering algorithms, which is based on the objective function .
Known data points are grouped into various categories, and
the cluster centers and degree of membership in each category
are calculated . The objective function is optimized by
calculating the membership of the given data points to all
cluster centers. However, the algorithm is very sensitive to the
parameter initial state values, which means that it can easily
VOLUME 8, 2020
J. Xiong et al.: Semi-Supervised FCM Clustering Optimized by SA and GA
fall into a local minimum point . Using a combination of
the SA and GA algorithms, the function can quickly converge
to the global optimal solution, where the objective-function
value of the non-similarity index is stabilized at its minimum.
Hypothesis 1: There is a dataset x
= (x1, x2, . . . , xn)
which is grouped into C categories, (S1, S2, . . . , SC), where
C ∈[2, n]. Each sample has C membership degrees and
(N1, N2, . . . , NC) are the cluster centers of (S1, S2, . . . , SC).
Theorem 1: The objective function Jm can be expressed as
Jm(M, N) =
where Aij is the membership of the sample xi relative to
category Sj.
Lemma 1: The Euclidean distance can be expressed as
dij = d(xi −Nj) = [
(xik −Njk)2]
where dij is the Euclidean distance, deﬁned as the distance
between the k −th sample xi and the center Nj of the j −th
Lemma 2: The purpose of fuzzy clustering is to ﬁnd an
optimal membership function M to minimize the value of the
objective function Jm. The total of the membership degrees
of all samples is
Ak(xi) = 1,
i = 1, 2 . . . , n.
Then, the membership degree of the sample point xi relative to class Sj can be calculated as:
i = 1, 2 . . . , n.
The clustering center ( Ni) can be calculated as:
j=1(Aij)bxij
j=1(Aij)b .
Equation (5) used to calculate c cluster centers. Equations
(4) and (5) are used to adjust the clustering center and membership degree repeatedly. Therefore, the clustering centers
of all samples types and the membership degrees of each
sample can be obtained theoretically, and thus, the partition
of the fuzzy clustering algorithm is completed. Despite that
the FCM has a high retrieval speed, it is a local retrieval
algorithm which is sensitive to the initial clustering center.
The algorithm will fall into a local minimum, if the initial
value is not properly selected .
Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, using fuzzy theory,
obtains the membership degree of each sample point to
all class centers by optimizing the objective function, and
weights the membership degree, so as to determine the class
of sample points to classify sample data. This method gets
the minimum value of Jm function, but the result may be
the local minima or saddle point of the function. Besides,
FCM is easily affected by outliers. Therefore, fuzzy c-means
clustering algorithm is not suitable for the bearing fault of
large-scale petrochemical units with noise and sample imbalance. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes the
application of semi supervised fault diagnosis method based
on simulated annealing and genetic algorithm optimization in
bearing fault diagnosis. See parts B and C for details.
B. GENETIC ALGORITHM
The GA, proposed by John Henry Holland in the 1870s,
is a computational model that mimics natural evolutionary
systems, and uses the biological evolution theory and the
stochastic exchange theory according to Darwin’s survival
of the ﬁttest . The basic concept is to randomly generate an initial population, whose individual genotype is a
tree structure. Then, according to the survival of the ﬁttest
principle, population duplication, crossover, and mutation are
performed using iterative optimization. Based on the size
of the ﬁtness value of each individual, the best individuals
are selected, forming a new population. The purpose of the
iterative process is to make the offspring population adapt
better to the environment and, once an iteration is terminated,
to decode the optimal individuals as the optimal solution,
which is usually used for parameter selection , . However, in the early stages of the iterative process, GA can easily
cause the whole population to consist of super individual
offspring, leading to premature optimization. Since in the
later stages of the GA, the individual population ﬁtness will
be similar, the predominance of ‘‘super individuals’’ is more
apparent in the offspring . A detailed ﬂowchart is shown
in Fig. 6, where GEN is the population size of the counter and
MAXGEN is the maximum number of evolutions.
1) Coding method: In this paper, the number of parameters
to be optimized are C initial clustering centers, in which each
dyeing is composed of C clustering centers. Assume that
each variable has M-dimensional and is encoded by K binary
codes. The length of chromosome is C×M×K.
2) Fitness function: It is used to evaluate the degree of
adaptation of each code string. The search type in genetic
algorithms is guided only by the ﬁtness function (Fit) .
The Fit in the paper is the accuracy after clustering and Jm
in Equation (1). The bigger the accuracy is, the smaller the
reciprocal is, and the bigger the ﬁtness is. The deﬁnition of
ﬁtness in this article is
Accuracy =
Fit = Jm +
where hi denotes the number of data belonging to class i after
clustering, and Hi denotes the total number of data belonging
to class i.
3) Selection operator: Its function is to copy parent
chromosomes of high ﬁtness to the following generation.
VOLUME 8, 2020

FIGURE 6. Flow chart of genetic algorithm.
Assuming a population size of U, the probability P that the
individual t can be chosen is
P = Fit(t)
4) Variation operator: It is an auxiliary method for generating new individuals, ensuring genotype diversity in the
population, while preventing search stagnation .
Genetic algorithm takes the ﬁtness function as the information guiding the search type. It only uses ﬁtness function value to measure the excellence of an individual, and
does not involve the process of derivation and differentiation
of objective function value, which makes genetic algorithm
show a high degree of superiority, because in reality, many
objective functions are difﬁcult to derive, or even do not
have derivatives. However, with the extensive research, the
disadvantages of genetic algorithm have come to light, such
1) The genetic algorithm is prone to nonstandard and inaccurate problems in coding.
2) As a single genetic algorithm coding can not fully
express the constraints of the optimization problem, it is
necessary to consider the threshold value for the infeasible
solution, which increases the workload and solution time.
3) The efﬁciency of genetic algorithm is usually lower than
other traditional optimization algorithms.
4) Genetic algorithm is prone to premature convergence.
C. SIMULATED ANNEALING ALGORITHM
To overcome the shortcomings of genetic algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm is used in this paper. The SA
algorithm was ﬁrst proposed by Metropolis et al. in 1953
 and was successfully introduced into the optimization
problem-solving process by Kirkpatrick et al. of the IBM
Thomas W. Watson Research Center in 1983 . The basic
principle of SA, which is used to simulate the optimal solution
process, is based on the solid annealing process in physics,
where a solid is ﬁrst heated to a certain temperature, so as to
melt it, and then it is slowly cooled into a solid with regular
microstructure. As the temperature of the solid increases, the
particles in the solid body accelerate and move continuously
in a non-uniform manner, and as the solid cools down, they
decelerate. When the temperature reaches the ambient temperature, the particles are in the lowest energy state and in
a state of thermal equilibrium . In the SA algorithm, the
solution is obtained by selecting a non-local optimal solution
with a certain probability that falls within the scope of the
initial solution. The loop iterates and as the simulated temperature decreases, the algorithm activity declines, approaching
eventually the global optimum.
According to the Metropolis criterion, the probability P
of a particle becoming stable when the temperature of the
particle is T can be deﬁned by:
where E is the internal energy of the particle at temperature T,
1E is the change in internal energy, and kb is the Boltzmann
constant. At temperature T, the particle satisﬁes the Boltzmann probability distribution – , which for a stable
molecule in the x state is derived by:
P( ¯E = E(x)) =
where ¯E is a random molecular energy variable, E(x) denotes
the energy of the molecule in the x state, and Z(T) is the
normalized factor of the probability distribution, which can
be deﬁned as:
Steps to implement the SA algorithm are shown as follow.
1) The initial solution M0 is arbitrarily generated. Let
M(0) = M0, set the initial temperature as T0, and let T = Tk,
where k = 0.
2) Use the Metropolis criterion to assess Mk and T, then
return Mi = M, with Mk as the current solution.
3) Cool down to the current temperature T and let
T = Tk + 1. If Tk + 1 < Tk, add 1 to k (k = k + 1).
4) Check if the annealing algorithm satisﬁes the termination condition. If yes, continue to step 5), otherwise, return to
5) Use Mk as the current optimal solution, output the
optimal value, and end the algorithm.
The advantages of SA are the following:
1) SA can deal with the objective function with any
degree of nonlinearity, discontinuity and randomness, and
the objective function can have any boundary conditions and
constraints.
VOLUME 8, 2020
J. Xiong et al.: Semi-Supervised FCM Clustering Optimized by SA and GA
FIGURE 7. Flowchart of the proposed clustering algorithm based on the GA and SA algorithm.
2) Compared with other linear optimization methods,
SA and is easy to implement with less programming work.
3) It can guarantee to ﬁnd the global optimal solution
statistically.
The disadvantages of SA are the following:
1) It takes a lot of time to ﬁnd the optimal solution, especially when using ‘‘standard‘‘ Boltzmann sampling technology (i.e. standard receiving function).
2) Compare with other algorithms, It needs more difﬁcult
parameter adjustment to solve a speciﬁc problem.
3) Cooling too fast will leads to simulated annealing to simulated quenching (SQ), which is not statistically guaranteed
to ﬁnd the optimal solution.
IV. CLUSTERING ALGORITHM BASED ON SIMULATED
ANNEALING AND GENETIC ALGORITHM
The three algorithms described above, are associated with
some disadvantages. In the proposed GA-SA-FCM algorithm
the following improvements have been made:
1) In order to solve the poor searching ability problem of
the GA, this study adopts the strong local searching ability
of the SA algorithm. The SA algorithm is integrated into the
solving process of the GA, in order to avoid the local optimal
searching process of the GA.
2) The combination of the GA and the SA algorithm can
signiﬁcantly improve the global search ability of the whole
algorithm.
3) This paper combines the SA with GA, and then, applied
to the FCM. By using the strong local search ability of the SA
and the strong global search ability of the GA, the clustering
problem can be solved effectively and quickly .
Firstly, set the parameters for three algorithms. Secondly,
cluster the training data, through which the distance value can
be got. Besides, we can also get the accuracy after clustering
by comparing the clustering category with the actual category.
Then the distance and the reciprocal of the accuracy value
were taken as the ﬁtness function of the genetic algorithm.
Here, the combination algorithm of SA and GA were used to
adjusts the clustering center of clustering algorithm until the
algorithm converges. Finally, a superior clustering center can
be obtained.The ﬂow chart of the proposed FCM based on the
GA and SA algorithms is shown in Fig. 7.

types of data can be obtained. Then, the clustering centers
were used as a standard for a class of data, while the remaining data are clustered.
V. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
The experiments were performed in the Key Laboratory of
Fault Diagnosis of Petrochemical Equipment, Guangdong
Province, China, using a fault diagnosis test platform of a
large-scale petrochemical multistage centrifugal blower. The
experimental platform was composed of 1) electric motor,
2) gearbox, 3) base platform, 4) coupling, 5) oil pipe, 6) fan,
as shown in Fig. 8. The experimental platform was used to
simulate a multistage centrifugal blower and common fault
conditions of rolling bearings.
FIGURE 8. Fault diagnosis test platform of large-scale rotating equipment
used in the petrochemical industry.
A. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
The experiments were performed on the rotary unit at a
frequency of 20kHz and a rotational speed of 800r/min. The
EMT390 vibrometer was used to collect signals under four
different conditions, including three fault states (outer-ring
wear, inner-ring wear, and bearing with one ball less), and
the normal state (normal bearing). Table 1 lists the machine
operation status types and the number of each corresponding
In this study, in order to clearly observe the effect of
clustering in the two-dimensional plane, the mutual dimensionless indicators were standardized, principal component
analysis was performed, and then the ﬁrst and second principal component characteristic indicators were selected as
input values. The data processing process can be seen in
Fig. 9 and the relevant theory has described in detail in the
literature .
Following main component analysis, Tables 2 to 5 demonstrate the corresponding contribution rate of each primary
component between different types of data combinations
respectively. When the ﬁrst and second primary components
were extracted, the contribution value of the selected sample
was as high as 98.84%, 99.2%, 99.7%, and 99.2%. When
the variance contribution rate of the main component exceeds

In this study, different types of data combinations above were
experimentally simulated. The characteristic indexes of the
ﬁrst and second principal components were the horizontal
and vertical axis, respectively . The experimental results
are shown in Figs. 10 to 13.

that the true clustering number of the normal bearing was 49,
the true clustering number of bearing with inner-ring wear
was 49, and the total clustering accuracy was 100%. Fig. 11
shows the result of a normal bearing and bearing with outerring wear before and after clustering. The true clustering
number of the normal bearing was 49, the true clustering
number of that with outer-ring wear was 47, and the total
clustering accuracy was 98%. According to Figs. 10 and 11,
normal bearings and bearings with inner-ring and outer-ring
wear can cluster well. In Fig. 12, the situation was different.
The number of true judgments of the normal bearing was 42,

were three fault types, the correct number of judgements was
30, 33,37, respectively, and the accuracy rate was 73%, which
was lower than the previous one. It can be seen that when the
fault types are increased, the optimized clustering algorithm

has a certain difﬁculty in resolution and the clustering accuracy rate decreases.
C. EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISON
In order to investigate the applicability and feasibility of the
proposed algorithm for bearing fault diagnosis in engineering applications, the FCM and the proposed GA-SA-FCM
algorithms were compared. In this comparative experiment,
six sets of fault data were used. Each group and the corresponding fault types are listed in Table 6 and the experimental
results are shown Table 7.
In Table 7, D method represents that the data processed by
dimensionless method, and M-D method represents mutual
dimensionless index. The samples of each fault combination
are selected randomly, that is to say, in Table 7, samples in
each row is the same, and different in different rows. Therefore, each experiment will show different results. Besides,
to make the result more convincing, we repeat the experience
for 20 times and average them.
Comparing the mutual dimensionless index and dimensionless index, we can ﬁnd that the mutual dimensionless index show good performance in clustering. For
FCM, the difference in accuracy was as high as 8.36%.
For GA-SA-FCM the difference in accuracy was as high as
In addition, the accuracy of GA-SA-FCM is higher than
the FCM. As is shown in Table 7, in No.3, the difference in
accuracy was as high as 5.5%. Therefore, taking the accuracy
after clustering as the ﬁtness value function of the GA can
improve the clustering effect, which is an improvement to the
FCM algorithms.

Besides, we compared the proposed GA-SA-FCM algorithm with method proposed in letter denoted as DSDF
for brieﬂy. Five types of data sets, including inner-ring wear,
outer-ring wear, large gears teeth deﬁciency, large gears teeth
deﬁciency and inner-ring wear combination, large gears teeth
deﬁciency and outer-ring wear combination were compared.
The comparison result were shown in Table 8 and 9.
In Table 8, the fault diagnosis accuracy rate of DSDF is
38.89%, and the GA-SA-FCM model is 56.30%. In Table 9,
FIGURE 15. DSDF and GA-SA-FCM fault diagnosis accuracy comparison
the fault diagnosis accuracy rate of DSDF is 33.33%, and
the GA-SA-FCM model is 48.89%, which means that the
proposed algorithm is obviously better than that proposed by
reference .
VI. DISCUSSION
In this paper, the accuracy of clustering and the distance
value were taken as the objective function of SA-GA, which
can improve the effect of clustering to a certain extent for
the reason that the proposed method was able to solve the
problem that cluster centers are easy inﬂuence by the outliers
and local minimum problem.
In addition, the experience result shows that the mutual
dimensionless indexes are more suitable for clustering algorithms than dimensionless one. for the reason that mutual
dimensionless indicators are able to narrow the dimensionless
the internal structure of the target distance, and then reduce
the overlap of the same dimensionless index. Table 7 also
shows that the advantage of our algorithm is obvious when
the fault data is processed by mutual dimensionless.
However, compared with the FCM algorithm, the proposed
method has high complexity. For the reason that the our
algorithm need to calculate the accuracy, and then use the

J. Xiong et al.: Semi-Supervised FCM Clustering Optimized by SA and GA
SA for overcoming the local minimum problem of SA. As is
shown in Table 7, with the increasing of the sample size the
CPU time of our method is increasing rapidly than FCM.
In addition, at present, we have no a systematic method to
determine the weight of the accuracy of clustering and the
distance value which have inﬂuence on the performance of
clustering.
VII. CONCLUSION
It is generally believed that the clustering algorithm quality
depends on the sum of the distance between the clustering
center and the data points. It is also believed that the smaller
the sum of distances, the better the clustering effect, while in
fact, this is not the case. Therefore, the clustering distance and
the clustering accuracy were used as the objective function,
and the GA-SA algorithm was used for optimization. The
experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can be better than the general clustering algorithm or
the fuzzy clustering algorithm, which take the sum of the
clustering distance as the objective function. Besides, with the
increase of data distribution complexity and outliers, the algorithm proposed in this paper will have better performance.
However, as we discussing in previous section, the proposed method still requires further improvements. Therefore,
our further research will focus on determining the weight
for the accuracy and distance (Jb) value and optimizing our
algorithm to reduce its CPU time.
