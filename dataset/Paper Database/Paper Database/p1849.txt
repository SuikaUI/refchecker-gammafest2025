Background: The purpose of this article is to describe and evaluate the methodology of online
focus group discussions within the setting of paediatric oncology.
Methods: Qualitative study consisting of separate moderated asynchronous online discussion
groups with 7 paediatric cancer patients (aged 8–17), 11 parents, and 18 survivors of childhood
cancer (aged 8–17 at diagnosis).
Results: All three participant groups could be actively engaged over a one-week period.
Respondents highly valued the flexibility and convenience of logging in at their own time and place
to join the discussion. Adolescent patients and survivors emphasized that the anonymity
experienced made them feel comfortable to express their views in detail. The findings indicate a
strong preference for online group discussions across all participant groups.
Conclusion: The findings show that online focus group methodology is a feasible tool for
collecting qualitative data within the setting of paediatric oncology, and may offer new
opportunities to collect data in other hard-to-include populations. The evaluations seem to indicate
that the online group discussions have given participants an opportunity to articulate their
experiences and views in a way they might not have done in a traditional group discussion.
Background
The world-wide expansion of access to and use of the
Internet over the last twdecades has made the Web a
prominent mode of communication, permeating people's
personal and professional lives. More recently, the Internet is being recognized as a research tool, offering new
opportunities for researchers to conduct quantitative and
qualitative research. Gaining popularity first in marketing
research, and in communication and media studies, Internet-based data collection is receiving increasing attention
in the social and health sciences. In particular, the
Web offers the unique possibility to include participants

who are hard to reach using traditional research methods,
e.g. due to time constraints, immobility, or active treatment. 
Interest in online focus groups came at a time when
researchers were being assailed by recruitment problems,
declining response rates, and rapidly raising costs for traditional focus group discussions. Independent of the setting, patient recruitment often is a bottle-neck in research
and a considerable number of projects need much more
time than planned to obtain a significant number of
patients. In this paper, we intend to contribute to this
discussion by describing the methods and feasibility of
online focus group discussions within the setting of paediatric oncology.
New modes of focus groups
A traditional face-to-face focus group (TFG) discussion is
a form of group interview, which has been a well-established practice for data collection across a range of disciplines since the early part of the 20th century . The
method is particularly effective for exploring people's
opinions and experiences regarding illness and healthcare, both from a consumers' and a providers' perspective.
 The appropriateness of this research tool in
eliciting children's views on and experiences in healthrelated matters has been shown extensively .
Distinctive terminology may be used for denoting online
focus group (OFG) discussions: e.g. computer-mediated
or Internet-based focus groups, electronic focus groups,
chat-based focus groups, or virtual panel discussions.
 All labels refer to research methods that
utilize the Internet to unite spatially and possibly temporally separate participants in text-based group discussions,
guided by a moderator. In general, the term OFG does not
refer to chat rooms or open panel discussions where participants are free to log in at any time, and post their comments on a random topic.
OFGs can be conducted in two ways: synchronously (in real
time) or asynchronously (not in real time), or using a combination of both. In the synchronous mode, participants
are online simultaneously at a prearranged time, and
immediately react to each other's responses as these are
received. The asynchronous mode refers to an ongoing
website where participants are free to log in during a set
period, read each others' contributions and post a comment themselves at a time that is convenient for them, not
necessarily when anyone else is participating.
Benefits online focus groups
Recent studies on the potential benefits of the use of OFGs
were remarkably similar, drawing particular attention to:
recruitment issues, participant convenience, researcher
benefits, and the quality of the data obtained. The most
obvious advantage of using online focus group methodology is that it enables access to populations that are hard to
include using standard research techniques and that it
facilitates dialogue between participants who may not
 . The Internet allows new recruitment opportunities for ill or disabled participants, housebound respondents, marginalized populations, and
socially or geographically isolated people. Recruitment is
a problem associated with TFG and is likely to grow,
because of the increasing difficulty of scheduling meetings
for busy people. The use of OFG may be an important tool
used to circumvent this problem.
A second significant advantage of using OFGs is providing
participants a convenient and comfortable way of joining
group discussions. Unconstrained
by place and time, online participants can contribute to
the group discussion at their leisure and individual places.
A distinctive feature in asynchronous group discussions is
that it allows participants to choose their time in answering questions, allowing more time to reflect.
In addition to these advantages for participants, potential
researcher benefits have been documented as well. Foremost amongst these advantages of OFGs, are cost and
time-savings due to the automatic and accurate capture of
the discussion data. Responses can be
transferred directly in a database where they are immediately accessible for analysis, without the need for transcription or editing, enhancing the accuracy of collected
data and eliminating transcriber bias. Additional benefits
of OFGs include lower recruitment costs compared with
TFGs and the absence of logistic and travel expenses.
Quality of data obtained
Several studies have investigated the comparability of
findings gained from TFGs and OFGs. They seem to suggest that the quantity and quality of data obtained online
are broadly comparable to those obtained by traditional
focus group discussions. Online data
collection has the added advantage of providing an effective format to collect sensitive or personal health information. Self-disclosure, defined as 'revealing personal
information to others', is a key objective in focus groups,
and lack of self-disclosure is often listed as a barrier to
effective group discussions. The anonymity afforded by
online communication is central in the explanation of
increased levels of self-disclosure in OFGs. The perceived
privacy makes the online environment more conducive to
eliciting honest and thoughtful responses. Furthermore, the visual anonymity provided by online focus
groups may reduce the social desirability bias, allowing
participants to feel more comfortable to voice their view-

points. In traditional focus group discussions,
participants may feel silenced or intimidated by more
talkative participants. An important advantage of the
online mode is the greater equality in participation than
in traditional groups, providing a more balanced impression of all the viewpoints being expressed in the discussion. Finally, the absence of time-pressure in
asynchronous forms of online discussion, allows considered responses that are lengthier and more detailed than
those in synchronous or traditional forms . The
aforementioned advantages attributed to conducting
group discussions online enhance the accuracy and objectivity of the data obtained, and, consequently, the quality
of the data.
Examples from paediatric oncology
Guidelines in paediatric oncology encourage health providers to share developmentally relevant medical information with young patients and their parents to enable
active participation in the decision-making process.
 Unknown, so far, is to what extent this mirrors
patients' and parents' preferences. In view of the merits of
OFGs as described above, and the awareness that young
patients and their parents are hard to include in group discussions, we expected the online mode of focus group discussions the best choice for this population. Children's
familiarity with the Internet further pleads in favour of
collecting data online. So far, the use of
online focus groups for collecting research data has not
been explored extensively in paediatric health care.
We therefore conducted a series of asynchronous online
focus group discussions with children in active treatment
for paediatric cancer, their parents, and child survivors of
paediatric cancer separately, to determine what constitutes good quality of communication in terms of participation and role delineation from their point of view. The
descriptive results of these OFGs have been reported in
more detail elsewhere. In this paper, will describe the
process of conducting asynchronous online focus groups
within the setting of paediatric cancer care and focus on
participants' evaluations of joining these group discussions online.
Sampling and recruitment
We identified a sample of three separate groups of participants: 8–17 year old patients in active treatment for
childhood cancer (diagnosed 6 weeks to 1 year ago); parents of these children; and a group survivors of childhood
cancer, who had been 8 to 17 years old at time of diagnosis, and whose treatment had been successfully finished
during the preceding five years. Exclusion criteria were
insufficient mastery of the Dutch language, a lag in development, treatment for secondary tumours, and being in
the palliative phase of treatment (oncologists' evaluations).
To minimize selection bias, patients and their parents
were included by consecutive inclusion, based on order of
appointment in two Dutch university paediatric oncology
wards. Letters describing the study objectives and requesting participation were given to eligible families by their
health care provider, either personal or by regular mail.
Family members could participate on an individual basis,
meaning that not necessarily both parents and child of
each participating family were included. Because survivors
did not visit the oncological wards on a regular basis, eligible participants were selected from electronic recording
systems in both wards, and invited by regular mail.
Written consent was obtained from 13 (41.9%) of the 31
eligible families, and 8 of them (25.8%) actually participated (7 patients and 11 parents). Nineteen (33.9%) out
of the 56 approached survivors agreed to participate, and
18 (32.1%) actually did. Separate group discussions were
organised for child patients (aged 8 to 11 years), adolescent patients (aged 12 to 17 years), parents and survivors.
A letter containing background information, the
homepage URL, an individual login name and password
was sent to all respondents who consented to participate.
For characteristics of participating patients, parents and
survivors: see Table 1. Ethical approval for the study was
obtained in advance .
Procedures
We opted for moderated, asynchronous online focus
group discussions, conducted following recently developed guidelines for online data collection. Precautions were taken to guarantee both
the anonymity of the participants and the confidentiality
of their contributions to the online discussions. Each participant was given a unique login name and password,
with which they could anonymously access their discussion group website during one week, 24 hours a day. All
participants were able to view the most recent contributions in their group as well as scroll back to view earlier
responses. The only persons who could be identified by
name were two researchers (KT and MZ) who acted as
moderators. Their role in establishing a creative, synergistic, non-inhibiting environment for discussion online was
very similar to what it would have beeen in a TFG, by regularly checking the postings, asking additional questions
to clarify participants' views, and encouraging group discussion. Following conventions used in TFGs,
a topic guide was developed, questioning participants'
experiences, needs and preferences with respect to communication in paediatric oncology. Instead of introducing

(page number not for citation purposes)
all questions at the start of the OFGs, the researchers
posted one question a day, aiming at optimal group discussion as recommended in previous research .
The content of the basic questions posed during the first
five days was equivalent for the three groups of participants, with the wording being adapted to the age range of
the respondents. On the third day, a reminder was sent to
those respondents who had not been joining the discussion. During the last two days, the participants were
invited to introduce new topics for discussion they considered relevant in communication in paediatric oncology. Questions of the previous days remained open for
responses during the whole week.
Since this was a novel technique, after closing of the
OFGs, all participants were invited by e-mail to individually evaluate the process of joining this group discussion
online, using a brief semi-structured online questionnaire. Areas of evaluation were drawn from the literature
on the benefits and challenges of online discussions,
including questions regarding: choices between OFG and
TFG, perceived benefits of both modes of group discussions, ease of access, duration of the OFGs, and whether
or not to introduce all questions at the start of the discussion.
Technical equipment
The OFGs were based on a Web Browser that could run on
an MS Windows/Web server platform and were served
from a sub site of the NIVEL website. This browser-based
application was developed in cooperation with the NIVEL
Knowledge Centre, using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to create the discussion boards. The website
included an introduction to the study, the aims of the
research, and a description of the group discussion rules.
When logging in, a password and login name had to be
filled in, ensuring authentication of legitimate participants. At each completion, a programmed notification
was sent by e-mail to the moderators, informing them that
the participant had posted a message in a specified discussion group. The server was continuously serviced and
monitored by professional staff.
The online focus groups generated rich and detailed qualitative data. The content of the focus groups responses
have been reported elsewhere. In this paper, we will
focus on the methodology of the online focus groups and
participants' evaluations of participating in these groups.
Children in active treatment for childhood cancer, their
parents, as well as survivors could be actively engaged over
a week period and expressed multi-faceted views regarding their communication needs and preferences. Many
participants returned to previously answered questions
and discussions and made new comments. The mean
number of postings per participant varied slightly across
the three groups: patients posted an average of 7 responses
(range 4–11); parents 4 (range 1–8), and survivors 6
(range 1–15) during the first 5 days of the focus group discussions. All respondents who were initially involved
were still accessing the website at the end of the study.
Focus group dynamics
Focus group dynamics varied considerably between the
three groups of participants. Younger children tended to
direct their comments to the moderators rather than to
each other, but always responded very dedicatedly to the
moderators' additional questions and probes. The adolescent patients and the survivors developed a far more interactive way of responding to each other, by reacting
actively to each others' contributions. Particularly the participants in the survivor group were very supportive
towards one another in acknowledging the experiences
their fellow participants described. Several survivors
expressed the need for further contact with other participants, as expressed in the following quote: "I would like to
keep in touch with some people of the study". The group
dynamic in the parental focus groups appeared to be far
less interactive. Parents entered very long and well-considered postings, but did hardly react spontaneously to other

parents' comments. As one parent stated: "It was not really
a group discussion, more like answers to statements". However, a lot of parents returned to previously answered
questions and posted additional information or clarified
their contributions in response to the moderators' questions.
Participants' evaluations
Four of the 7 child patients, all 11 parents, and 16 of the
18 survivors filled in the evaluation questionnaire after
closing of the OFGs. Ease of use of the online group discussions was judged to be good by the vast majority of the
respondents (24 of 31 respondents), just as most participants positively valued the frequency of one question a
day (24 of 31 respondents). In our study we set a time
period of 1 week for joining the group discussion. All participants in the patient group were satisfied with this time
frame, whereas most survivors and parents would have
preferred an extended duration: "I think there would be
more discussion if people had had more time to think about it"
(survivor).
In response to the question whether or not participants
would have attended a group discussion on the same
topic if offered in a traditional face-to-face format, 11 participants reacted positively (1 patient, 4 parents, 6 survivors), 11 respondents stated that they would not have
joined a traditional group discussion (6 parents, 5 survivors), and 9 participants were not sure (3 patients, 1 parent, 5 survivors). When participants were asked which
mode of group discussion they would have preferred to
join if they would be free to choose, 22 of 31 participants
opted for the online format (3 patients, 9 parents, 10 survivors). Only three survivors and two parents expressed a
preference for traditional face-to-face focus groups, and
one patient and three survivors could not decide. These
findings indicate a strong preference for OFGs across all
participant groups.
The evaluation highlighted that most respondents had
clear and outspoken ideas about the relative pros and cons
of online group discussions. Participants who would have
preferred a TFG, considered the online mode of discussion less personal compared to face-to-face communication: "I, personally, also like to see the people I am talking
with." (survivor), and: "It is also very cosy and you understand
each other better than when you have to tell everything on the
Internet" (survivor). A strong and consistent finding that
emerged in each group was the advantage of participant
convenience attributed to online communication. Most
participants expressed great comfort with the flexibility of
logging in at their own place and time: "This way, I don't
have to miss out on extras at school" (survivor), and: "It is
quite a job to plan being from home for part of the day." (parent).
Another major advantage that emerged from the respondents' evaluations was the potential for greater anonymity
in online interactions. Participants indicated that they felt
more comfortable and free to express their views, and
worried less about what others might think of them: "The
advantage of a conversation on the Internet is that other people
can't see how you handle things, emotions and stuff like that"
(patient). Some participants explicitly expressed that the
anonymity experienced during the online discussions
stimulated their self -disclosure: "It is sometimes difficult
thinking about hard times you have had in the past. With
strangers it is even more difficult to find the right words. On the
Internet it is easier to be yourself." (survivor). Another survivor stated in addition: "It is hard to tell your story to people
you don't know when you are sitting opposite them. I am also a
bit shy, so if I had to tell it in a group, I would not tell as much
as I would do in this study on the Internet". These evaluations
seem to indicate that the online group discussions have
given participants an opportunity to articulate their experiences and views in a way that they might not have done
in a traditional group discussion.
Discussion
Benefits online focus groups
This study is, to our knowledge, the first to conduct online
focus group discussions within the setting of paediatric
oncology. Despite the pervasiveness of Internet access and
children's preference for this new medium, researchers
have largely neglected its use for collecting data in health
care. The results show that OFGs are a feasible
alternative method of obtaining qualitative information
from respondents who, by a large majority, would not
otherwise have joined our study. Children in active treatment for childhood cancer, their parents, as well as survivors could be actively engaged over a week period and
provided balanced feedback about the relative pros and
cons of online group discussions.
The asynchronicity of the OFGs provided several advantages. Respondents highly valued the flexibility and convenience of logging in at their own place and time. The
format permitted respondents a concomitant increased
amount of time for reflection, to respond at length, and
the opportunity to change or nuance their opinion.
Our findings also confirmed the importance of anonymity offered by the online environment in stimulating selfdisclosure. In their evaluations, adolescent patients and survivors emphasized that the anonymity experienced during OFGs made them feel comfortable
to express their views in more detail, without worrying
about the immediate responses from others. This was
reflected in the high equality of participation and the
diversity in the responses within each OFG, enhancing the
accuracy and objectivity of the data obtained, and, conse-

quently, the quality of the data. These benefits
of discussing anonymously are reported to be more sizeable for personal or sensitive topics that are troublesome to
handle in a face-to-face environment .
The respondents provided thoughtful and often supportive comments. This may be due to respondents' strong
commitment to the topic under discussion, as is evident
from the subsequent quotes: "I hope that, with this study,
concrete plans can be made how to talk with children with cancer in the future". (survivor), and: "This study is very important, I think, and a good initiative! I would like to cooperate in
any follow-up study." (survivor).
The benefits for the researcher that were realized in terms
of time and cost savings due to the automatic capture of
the discussion data, while not of the same order as
improved quality of the data obtained, were by no means
insignificant.
Limitations
A serious concern associated with online data collection is
selection bias, due to non-representativeness of the sample and self-selection of participants. Limited computer
access or computer-illiteracy may restrict participation,
creating a digital divide between the 'have nets' and the
'have nots', thus leading to age or socio-economic status
sampling bias . Self-selection of participants
from a non-random pool of Internet users may additionally decrease the external validity.
Like traditional focus groups, however, the aim of our
study was to achieve a depth of understanding rather than
generalization. In order to avoid the pitfall of selection
bias, consecutive inclusion of participants was conducted
instead of relying on self-selection through the Internet,
thereby increasing the representativeness of the sample,
and ultimately, the validity of the results . Furthermore, no differences could be detected for responding
and non-responding participants. 
The number of participants might be another limitation.
In the present study only four children and three adolescents in active treatment participated. Although this is not
unusual in studies of this nature, it is considered to be the
minimum group size for a focus group . Our
overall response was 25.8% for eligible families and
32.1% for survivors. We consider this an adequate
response rate, in view of the difficult situation parents and
children in active treatment for paediatric cancer are faced
with. In two of the families that did not participate despite
their initial consent, the child's physical condition had
deteriorated dramatically at the start of the OFGs. However, data for comparison are missing, since web-based
researchers have not (yet) consistently reported response
rates .
A final shortcoming is that we could not check whether
respondents logged in without contributing to the discussion. It would have been helpful to know if participants
were accessing and reading the discussions (so-called lurking), or were not entering the focus group website at all.
However, the software did not allow for recording of the
date and time of logins of non-responding participants.
Unanswered questions and future research
Probably one of the most widely cited disadvantages to
using online group discussions is the reported lack of nonverbal signals. The conclusions regarding
the loss of these cues in online communication have been
very mixed, both with positive and negative connotations.
A potential disadvantage of lack of nonverbal cues is the
less personal nature of the medium and a heightened
potential for misinterpretation of the written communication, leading to the assumption that group dynamic is
negatively impacted in an online environment. Other
studies emphasize that although the dynamics of communicating in OFGs may differ from traditional forms, there
is no conclusive evidence that the Internet indeed is an
impoverished or impersonal environment. In
sum, the relative feasibility and reliability of the different
modes of focus group discussions still need further exploration. A systematic comparison of both the process and
the outcomes of each format will allow researchers to
apply the appropriate focus group design, depending on
the issues at stake and the purposes aimed at.
Another question that deserves further investigation is
that of respondents' preferences for different modes of
group discussions. Participants' evaluations of the
research method employed may have major implications
for their willingness to disclose personal information and
to participate in future (health services) research. An
intriguing question is whether online research methodologies that relate more closely to the needs of participants
are prerequisite to involve a new generation of potential
respondents. 
Conclusion
Our findings emphasize that online focus groups have
considerable potential for gathering high quality data
within a relatively short period of time from respondents
who are unable or unwilling to engage in traditional
group discussions. As such, the methodology offers access
to respondents from understudied or marginalized populations that were previously hard to include. We would
not wish to argue that online focus groups should totally
replace their traditional counterpart, but we anticipate the

online format to become a valued option in the
researcher's toolbox.
