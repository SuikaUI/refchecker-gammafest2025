Abstract. The term herd immunity has been used by
various authors to conform to dierent de®nitions.
Earlier this situation had been identi®ed but not corrected. We propose that it should have precise meaning
for which purpose a new de®nition is oered: ``the
proportion of subjects with immunity in a given population''. This de®nition dissociates herd immunity
from the indirect protection observed in the unimmunised segment of a population in which a large
proportion is immunised, for which the term `herd
eect' is proposed. It is de®ned as: ``the reduction of
infection or disease in the unimmunised segment as a
result of immunising a proportion of the population''.
Herd immunity can be measured by testing a sample of
the population for the presence of the chosen immune
parameter. Herd eect can be measured by quantifying
the decline in incidence in the unimmunised segment of
a population in which an immunisation programme is
instituted. Herd immunity applies to immunisation or
infection, human to human transmitted or otherwise.
On the other hand, herd eect applies to immunisation
or other health interventions which reduce the probability of transmission, con®ned to infections transmitted human to human, directly or via vector. The
induced herd immunity of a given vaccine exhibits
geographic variation as it depends upon coverage and
ecacy of the vaccine, both of which can vary geographically. Herd eect is determined by herd immunity as well as the force of transmission of the
corresponding infection. Clear understanding of these
phenomena and their relationships will help improve
the design of eective and ecient immunisation
programmes aimed at control, elimination or eradication of vaccine preventable infectious diseases.
Introduction
The term `herd immunity' is increasingly frequently
seen in recent literature on the epidemiology of infectious diseases and on their prevention and control
by immunisation. This was found by Medline search
 using the key words `herd immunity' and
`herd eect'. While a large number of papers were
found with the key word `herd immunity', none was
found with the key word `herd eect'. A review of
several papers has shown that `herd immunity' is used
by dierent authors for dierent ideas, such as a
concept, a phenomenon or a measurable parameter.
In this paper we oer new insights and suggest a new
de®nition of the term `herd immunity' and dissociate
it from the indirect eect of immunisation of part of a
population on the incidence of infection or disease in
the unimmunised remainder, for which the term `herd
eect' is proposed and de®ned.
De®nitions currently available for herd immunity
Three de®nitions of herd immunity given in recent
text or reference books are quoted below. The emphasis of phrases is ours.
(1) ``Herd immunity. The resistance of a group to
attack by a disease because of the immunity of a large
proportion of the members and the consequent lessening of the likelihood of an aected individual
coming into contact with a susceptible individual'' .
(2) ``Herd immunity. It is not necessary to immunise every person in order to stop transmission of an
infectious agent through a population. For those
organisms dependent upon person-to-person transmission, there may be a de®nable prevalence of immunity in the population above which it becomes
dicult for the organism to circulate and reach new
susceptibles. This prevalence is called herd immunity''
(3) ``Herd immunity. It is well known that not
everyone in a population needs to be immunised to
eliminate disease ± often referred to as herd immunity. This is because successful immunisation reduces the number of susceptibles in the population
and this eectively reduces the eciency with which
the microbe is transmitted from one person to the
other. This has the same eect on the incidence of
infection as a reduction in the number of individuals
in a population. The microbe cannot sustain itself
and disease disappears at some level of vaccine

coverage that is less than 100%. On the other hand,
coverage below that needed to prevent disease may
have little impact on the total number of susceptibles ± as has been predicted using mathematical
models and veri®ed, in the case of rubella, by observation.
implementation
immunisation
programmes needs to be accompanied by case surveillance, in conjunction with analysis of appropriate serological samples both before and after the
introduction of the vaccine. If such data are not
carefully scrutinised, the consequence may be dire.
For example, an immunisation programme may reduce the number of cases but at the same time may
increase the average age at which the infection occurs. If the severity of disease increases with age of
acquisition, as in rubella (the risk of an infected
foetus in an infected woman) and polio (the risk of
paralytic disease), an immunisation programme may
be less useful than none at all'' .
The ®rst de®nition considers herd immunity conceptually as the resistance to disease due to reduced
risk of infection in a group of individuals as a result
of a large proportion among them (but not all) being
immune, not necessarily due only to immunisation
 . The second de®nition clari®es that the term applies to the actual proportion of immunised individuals
organism to circulate and reach new susceptibles .
By this de®nition herd immunity is a threshold value
of a measurable parameter (vaccination coverage)
resulting in retardation of person-to-person transmission of an infection. Elimination of infection or
disease is not required but only implied in this definition. How can we arrive at a de®nable level
(proportion) of immunity when the end point is
merely diculty of transmission, which is not de-
®ned, hence not measurable? The third de®nition is
closely similar to the ®rst but it develops it further to
a phenomenon providing the means to eliminate an
infectious disease from a population when a proportion that is less than 100% is immunised . Here
the phenomenon has a measurable end point ± that
of the disappearance or elimination of disease in a
group. In contrast to the second de®nition, here the
actual input (immunisation coverage) necessary to
achieve this measurable endpoint can be quanti®ed.
However it seems that the term herd immunity refers
to the phenomenon of zero incidence in the unimmunised segment rather than the actual proportion
immunised to achieve it . The strict application of
this de®nition requires the disappearance of disease
due to immunisation coverage of less than 100% of
susceptibles. This is a very rare event, exempli®ed by
the global eradication of smallpox without immunising all susceptibles and the elimination of poliomyelitis
polioviruses
America when only some 65 to 70% immunisation
coverage had been reached . Interestingly, in the
case of poliomyelitis, near 100% coverage of infants
and additional annual repetitive vaccination of the
same cohorts of susceptible children were necessary
for 8±9 years to interrupt transmission in Brazil,
showing that `herd immunity' was not evident for
the same vaccine against the same disease, but in a
dierent region . This clearly shows that herd
immunity (by the third de®nition) is a function of
not only immunisation but also the force of transmission of the pathogen. This de®nition is ambiguous about one aspect of the end point: is it zero
disease or infection? The second de®nition clearly
addresses infection while the ®rst one focuses on
infection and disease. Only the second de®nition
clari®es that we are dealing with only person-toperson transmitted infectious diseases.
A new insight in the third de®nition is that in some
cases it might be harmful to immunise a proportion
and obtain only partial or incomplete `herd immunity', since it might worsen the problem by delaying
infection and not eliminating it, as in the case of
maternal and foetal rubella . This is an important
point. A similar situation might arise in the cases of
immunisation against hepatitis A and varicella also.
Partial coverage of children may slow down virus
circulation and delay infection in the unimmunised.
Hepatitis A and varicella are more severe in adults
than in children. Here a new phrase such as `partial'
or `incomplete' herd immunity had to be introduced
to overcome the problem caused by the very de®nition which demands disappearance of disease.
A review of several recent publications with the key
word herd immunity showed that the term has most
often been used to mean the concept of reduced
transmission due to high immunisation level, in accordance with one or another of the three de®nitions
given above. For example the `concept of herd immunity' has been advocated as useful in designing
immunisation programmes. . Herd immunity has
been quali®ed as a `key concept' in population based
immunisation programmes . The author of a
landmark review of the history, theory and practical
aspects of herd immunity chose not to prefer ``any
single de®nition of herd immunity, rather accepting
the varied uses of the term by dierent authors'' .
Recognising the consequent potential for confusion,
the reviewer coined the phrase `herd immunity
threshold' to indicate the minimum prevalence of
immune individuals necessary to interrupt transmission of infection . Its major purpose was to
distinguish between the desirable outcome of interruption of transmission from the potentially undesirable eect mentioned above. In general herd
immunity is considered desirable by most authors,
but there is incongruity in using the term `immunity'
to cover adverse outcomes also. In summary, the
de®nitions are not clear, precise or complete; nor do
they agree among themselves. A precise de®nition is
necessary. We do not favour the status quo approach
adopted by one reviewer .
The proposed new de®nition for herd immunity
The term herd immunity contains two words, herd
(meaning a group or community) and immunity
which has to be interpreted. Previously the term immunity did mean a state of protection but today it
means a state in which the immune system of the
body has reacted speci®cally to de®ned immunogen(s). It is an attribute of the individual, not a
group. If so desired immunity can be tested for, as the
presence of antibody, or as skin test or lymphocyte
response to stimulation, against the chosen antigen.
Putting the two terms together, it is proposed that
herd immunity be now de®ned simply as the proportion of subjects with immunity in a given population.
quanti®able by testing a sample of the population for
the presence of the selected immune parameter. It
may be due to natural infection, or immunisation, or
a combination of both. It is not dependent on the
ease or diculty of circulation of an infectious agent,
nor its elimination. In certain cases, past infection
(inducing long lasting immunity) and immunisation
(inducing near 100% immunity which is long lasting)
may be used as surrogates of immunity for quantifying herd immunity.
Indeed, some authors have actually used the term
herd immunity to mean the proportion of subjects
with immunity, in conformity with our new de®nition
and clearly at variance with the de®nitions cited
earlier [9±11]. They have obviously assumed that they
were using the term correctly [9±11]. For example, in
a survey of antibody prevalence by age to varicellazoster virus, the prevalence was referred to as herd
immunity . In a study of measles outbreaks in two
adjacent towns in Japan, the term `herd immunity
level' was used interchangeably with the sum of frequency of vaccination and of previous history of
measles . The authors presented it as the complement of `susceptibility rate' . In another study
of antibody prevalence and hepatitis A outbreaks, the
former was equated to herd immunity . There are
many more such publications in which the term herd
immunity has been used in accordance with our new
de®nition.
To recapture the spirit of the earlier but imprecise
de®nitions, we can say that as herd immunity due to
immunisation increases, at some point, which is short
of 100% coverage, the circulation of the corresponding agent may cease. That point or value of
herd immunity (called `herd immunity threshold' by
one author) cannot be the same for dierent diseases
and for the same diseases it need not be the same in
dierent communities . An interesting question
could be asked: can the consequence (short of elimination of infection) of increasing herd immunity by
immunisation be measured? If it can be, then the
®xation on the requirement of interruption of transmission can be eliminated. For this purpose a dierent term, namely `herd eect' is introduced to denote
the perturbation, if any, on the incidence of disease or
infection in the unimmunised segment of a population, induced by the herd immunity of immunisation.
The proposed de®nition of herd eect
It is proposed that herd eect be de®ned as the alteration of the epidemiological frequency parameters
(of infection or disease as the case may be) in the
unimmunised segment of a population as a result of
immunising a proportion of the population. The alteration is usually a decline of incidence of infection
(hence lower incidence of disease). Therefore it may
be simpler to de®ne it as the reduction of infection or
disease in the unimmunised segment as a result of
immunising a proportion of the population. Lowered
incidence of infection due to the herd eect of immunisation may, in some cases, be associated with
increased incidence of disease consequent upon an
upward shift in age of infection (example hepatitis A,
maternal rubella syndrome in infants) or increased
severity disease (such as adult varicella). However, in
the age group immunised there will always be a reduction of incidence if there was herd eect. In most,
if not all other cases, herd eect of high herd immunity induced by immunisation is bene®cial in reducing
the burden of disease; its extreme bene®t is the interruption of transmission itself. In some earlier
publications by one of us, the term herd eect had
actually been used with this meaning .
Earlier we had drawn attention to the contrast
between North America where polioviruses were
eliminated with routine immunisation coverage (with
3 doses of oral poliovaccine) of below 80% and South
America where near 100% coverage with some 9±10
doses were required for the same eect . According
to the new de®nitions the herd immunity and the herd
eect were dierent in these two regions. The reason
for dissimilar herd immunity is the geographic difference in vaccine ecacy, necessitating a higher level
of vaccine coverage in the region with lower vaccine
ecacy to achieve a similar level of herd immunity.
The large dierence in the vaccine coverage and
number of doses needed to eliminate polioviruses in
South America in comparison to North America
cannot be attributed to the lower herd immunity
alone but to insucient herd eect as well. The difference in herd eect for similar levels of herd
immunity is due to dierence in the force of transmission of wild polioviruses . In other words,
when 100 children are given three doses, whereas in
North America virtually 100% herd immunity is induced, in South America and in India only some 70%
is induced, proving lower vaccine ecacy .
Whereas the median age of poliomyelitis (in the preimmunisation era) in North America was above
15 years, it was below 15 months in India, proving
higher force of transmission . The confounding of the assumed direct relationship between vaccine coverage and incidence of infection by these two
phenomena (dissimilar herd immunity for similar
vaccine coverage and dissimilar herd eect for similar
herd immunity) confused many world experts on
polio, who persisted with the three-dose dogma , mainly because of the lack of clear
de®nition of the term herd immunity and the lack of
understanding of the relationships between herd immunity, herd eect and transmission of polioviruses.
As an aside, the enhanced potency inactivated poliovaccine does not show any geographic variation of
vaccine ecacy. We have observed much better herd
eect of the latter vaccine; this is additional evidence
for our argument presented above , In short,
when herd immunity is rede®ned to mean the immunity prevalence in a population, the cessation of
transmission due to immunisation can be seen as the
herd eect of high herd immunity due to high immunisation coverage with a vaccine having high
vaccine ecacy.
Since herd eect is not necessarily break in transmission, but the reduction in transmission, a lower
coverage level would have a lower herd eect and a
very high coverage level could result in high herd
eect leading to zero incidence even in the unimmunised. While herd immunity is applicable to any
infection irrespective of its transmission pathways
and to immunity induced naturally (by infection) or
arti®cially (by immunisation), herd eect applies only
when infected persons participate in the transmission
of an agent and when immunisation induces at least
some protection against infection (and not merely
against disease). Thus, immunisation against tetanus
or rabies (even if given routinely) will have no herd
eect. As BCG inoculation seems to protect only
against progressive primary tuberculosis and not
against secondary type pulmonary tuberculosis, it
also has no herd eect.
The measurement of herd eect
To be useful in understanding and quantifying the
eects of immunisation it is not sucient to dierentiate herd eect from herd immunity, but we
should be able to measure them. It was pointed out
earlier that herd immunity is measurable by testing a
sample of the population for the required parameter
of immunity. Under certain circumstances, herd eect
can also be measured. One of the best studies in
which it was measured is that of immunisation of
children with pertussis toxoid decreasing the spread
of pertussis within the family . The investigators
found that vaccination of children with the toxoid
was followed by signi®cant reduction in incidence of
pertussis among siblings and parents. They did
not use the term herd eect, but called it `indirect
protection'. Interestingly they measured this eect as:
(Indirect protection) = (1 ) R), where R was the
ratio of incidence rates in contacts (parents and siblings) of recipients of toxoid (immunised) and of
(unimmunised)
measurements
(VE) = (1 ) R), where R is the ratio of the incidence
rates in immunised and unimmunised. Therefore,
for ease of use, we may use the term `VE equivalent'
for the measure of herd eect, since the method
of measurement and the way it is expressed as the
percent reduction in incidence are both very much
like VE itself.
It now becomes obvious that herd eect confounds
the measurements of VE, since the incidence in the
unimmunised is altered by the introduction of immunisation in a group. Thus, the measurement of VE
subsumes herd eect when it is estimated in `®eld'
(community) immunisation programme settings. An
interesting corollary of this relationship between herd
eect and VE is that in a community in which immunisation has already been introduced the true VE
cannot be measured by comparing the incidences in
the vaccinated and the unvaccinated; the measured
VE will be an underestimate. In such situations either
historical data on incidence prior to introducing
vaccination or incidence in an unvaccinated but
similar community must be used to obtain the true
measure of VE, corrected for herd eect. If VE is
measured in a clinical study, in which a limited
number of children living in a large community are
immunised, implying thereby that herd eect is minimum or none, then we may get a dierent value. If
the immune response of immunised children is measured in the clinical setting, then we get only a surrogate for VE without exhibiting protection, and not
confounded by herd eect. For these reasons, the
term vaccine ecacy should be quali®ed as `immunogenic VE,' `clinical VE' and `®eld level VE' as has
already been suggested .
Relevance of herd eect and herd immunity in
immunisation programmes
From the de®nitions of and relationships between
herd eect and herd immunity stated above it is clear
that neither is relevant for the vaccination of an occasional individual, but both are important elements
in large scale or community wide immunisation programmes. Programme managers are advised to factor
in these issues in planning an immunisation programme, or when introducing a new vaccine in an
existing programme, and also to monitor herd immunity and herd eect in the community as part of
planned assessment/evaluation. The relationship between the two will depend on the type of immunity in
consideration, its realised value at a point in time and
the rate at which it is realised. Immunising agents
which provide protection only against disease but not
against infection may have no herd eect. Many
vaccines protect well against disease but not so well
against infection. Since infection without disease is
silent, it would seem that the protection is against
infection also. Partial protection against infection
may result in lower extent of multiplication or shorter
duration of potential transmissibility, thereby tending
to reduce the risk of infection in others. The level of
herd eect induced by a vaccine (providing at least
some protection against infection) will depend on the
level of herd immunity at a point in time, probably in
a non-linear fashion and this would further be modi®ed by the rate at which this level is achieved in
relation to time. For example, we have shown that
the herd eect achieved in `pulse immunisation' is
very much higher than that of routine immunisation
programme, for the same level of herd immunity . In our pioneering experiment, with 65%
coverage with 3 doses of OPV given in pulse fashion,
the transmission of poliovirus appeared to have
ceased abruptly, in contrast to its continued circulation in spite of over 90% coverage in year round
routine immunisation . Even though this dierence may be partly due to the short duration of gut
immunity induced by OPV, the principle of excellent
herd eect of pulse immunisation is still valid as has
been shown with successful elimination of measles
from a community by annual single day pulse immunisation of only children over one year .
Investigation, clear conceptualisation and application of these relationships will improve our ability to
ecient immunisation
programmes aimed at control, elimination or eradication
of vaccine preventable infectious diseases in the transmission of which humans participate signi®cantly.
Herd eect of interventions other than vaccination
It is worthwhile to realise that herd eect is the
consequence of reducing transmission. Therefore
other interventions which also reduce the transmission potential will have similar herd eect. To control
lymphatic ®lariasis, mass treatment with Ivermectin
or diethyl carbamazine is being used in many endemic
areas. By reducing the parasitaemia in individuals
and reducing the number of parasitaemic individuals,
the drug causes a reduction in transmission to susceptibles even if they had not taken the drug. Mass
application of the drug is akin to pulse application of
a vaccine. If done well, ®lariasis could be eliminated
by this approach since there is no extra-human source
of infection. Even though 100% of population do not
(and need not) receive treatment, the reduction of
infection in the untreated segment is the herd eect of
pulse therapy with the drug.
The public health approach to tuberculosis control
is the early detection and antimicrobial treatment of
pulmonary tuberculosis in the hope that further
spread may be curtailed. This is another example of
`indirect protection' not due to immunity but due to
decreased chance of spread, very much like in the case
of reduced transmission due to immunisation. If increasing proportions of persons with pulmonary
tuberculosis are diagnosed and treated early, the incidence of infection in the susceptible population
should continue to decline; this may also be called
herd eect. On the other hand, if multi-drug therapy
of leprosy should have similar herd eect, we must be
sure that transmission occurs from the infected persons directly (like tuberculosis) or via vector (like
®lariasis). The lack of conclusive evidence for such
transmission is a lacuna in the strategy to control
leprosy taking advantage of the assumed herd eect
of multi-drug therapy. In the case of malaria,
chemoprophylaxis in a large proportion of persons
and/or the use of insecticide-impregnated bed nets
may also have some herd eect. This is due to the fact
that each prevented infection reduces further transmission and also because mosquitoes may not get
access to infected persons sleeping in nets.
Thus herd eect may in general be de®ned as the
change (reduction) in the incidence of infection or
disease in the un-intervened segment of a susceptible
population due to the intervention in the rest of the
population, compared to the incidence in the absence
of intervention in the entire population. However, we
have focused on the herd eect of immunisation
programmes in this paper and we recommend that
the term be quali®ed by the nature of intervention
when appropriate (as due to early diagnosis and
treatment, mass treatment etc). In ordinary use, when
not quali®ed, herd eect will be taken as due to herd
