This paper explores two ways to help students locate most
relevant resources in educational digital libraries. One method
gives a more comprehensive access to educational resources,
through multiple pathways of information access, including
browsing and information visualization. The second method is to
access personalized information through social navigation
support. This paper presents the details of the Knowledge Sea II
system for comprehensive personalized access to educational
resources and also presents the results of a classroom study. The
study delivered a convincing argument for the importance of
providing multiple information presentations modes, showing that
only about 10% of all resource accesses were made through the
traditional search interface. We have also collected some solid
evidence in favor of the social navigation support.

1. INTRODUCTION
The way computers are used in education is changing rapidly.
Large repositories of educational material are being created,
including educational digital libraries (EDL) such as the National
Science Digital Library (NSDL) and repositories of reusable
learning objects [11; 16]. These repositories attempt to collect a
large volume of high-quality material which has been carefully
authored, reviewed and indexed with standard metadata. Teachers
and students at all levels can greatly benefit from these
repositories. A challenge for the researchers is to provide efficient
tools and services which will allow the users of educational digital
libraries to locate resources that are relevant to their individual
goals, interests, and current knowledge.
Presently, educational digital libraries (EDL) rely on the
traditional information retrieval approach as the only way to
access educational resources in EDL. For example, NSDL focuses
on providing powerful search and discovery services .
However, in any reasonably sized EDL it is very challenging to
find the most appropriate resources among the hundreds of links
returned by a search service. The results of several research
projects show that the ability to choose appropriate links requires
a relatively high level of background or domain knowledge [2;
15]. Even in relatively small EDL where a query typically returns
dozens of hits, less prepared students may have problems
narrowing it down to resources that are relevant. As the growth of
EDL accelerates, search-only access may become practically
unusable even for domain experts. A query that once yielded tens
of hits now yields thousands .
This paper explores two ways to help students locate the most
relevant resources in educational digital libraries. First, we
attempt to provide more comprehensive access to educational
resources in EDL. For the purpose of this paper we distinguish
four major techniques of information access: ad-hoc information
retrieval (IR), information filtering, hypertext browsing, and
information visualization .
In ad-hoc information retrieval (IR), users get access to relevant
information by issuing a query to an IR system or search engine
and analyzing a ranked list of documents (for example, book
records), which are returned as a result. In modern information
filtering, a system actively recommends relevant documents to the
users, on the basis of inferred or provided interest profiles. In
hypertext browsing, a user attempts to find relevant documents by
browsing links that interconnect documents within a collection. In
information visualization, a set of documents is presented to the
user using some visualization metaphor in 2 or 3 dimensions; the
user observes or, in the case of interactive visualization, interacts
with the visualized set to find the most relevant documents. While
multiple research studies argue that different techniques of
information access have different strengths that may complement
each other, most EDL rely on IR as their sole method of
information access. A few advanced projects such Walden's Paths
 and Instructional Architect attempt to supplement searchonly access with recommendations that are manually created by
teachers through a path-building service or an advanced lesson-

building service. We attempt to advance progress even further by
providing all four ways of information access and then exploring
the value of this comprehensive access.
Second, we attempt to help users locate resources that are relevant
to their goals, knowledge, and interests through personalized
access to resources . Over the last two years we have been
exploring a promising approach to personalization access known
as social navigation . Social navigation tries to solve the
navigation problem by taking advantage of the natural human
tendency to follow in the footsteps of other people with similar
interests. We are trying to use this tendency toward social
navigation to assist learners to find the right information easier
and faster. We started exploring social navigation support in the
context of our Knowledge Sea project, which is currently focused
on helping beginning programming students find relevant
readings among the hundreds of online tutorial pages that are
distributed over the Web. Social navigation relies heavily upon
user feedback from group members. User feedback can be
gathered through explicit forms, such as direct ratings, or it may
be measured in implicit formats, such as by counting visits to a
In our earlier studies of Knowledge Sea II we focused on
information access through visualization and explored social
navigation support based on implicit feedback collected through
recording every time a learner navigates through the system .
Our results demonstrated that (1) information visualization is an
efficient technique of information access within the EDL context
and (2) social navigation support is highly appreciated by
students. In our current work we attempt to use page annotations
as an additional source of social feedback. This annotation feature
enables students to write notes for each tutorial page and highlight
different parts of the tutorial pages. In addition we supplemented
the original visualization-centered Knowledge Sea system with
other ways of information access in order to explore the value of a
more comprehensive information access system. In the Fall
Semester of 2004, the new version of the system, which had
comprehensive techniques of information access and enhanced
social navigation, was explored in a classroom study. The study
showed that both comprehensive access and social navigation
support are important for students using an EDL. This paper
describes our approach, which offers social navigation support in
a web-based environment for several techniques of information
access (section 2) and then describes the evaluation of our
approach through a classroom study (section 3). The last section
of the paper illustrates some possible future directions for our
2. KNOWLEDGE SEA
Knowledge Sea is the platform we use to explore personalized
information access. Currently, the system provides access to over
25,000 documents related to teaching C programming, distributed
over the Web. The original goal of Knowledge Sea was to bridge
the gap between open corpus online resources (such as online
tutorials and textbooks) and closed corpus resources (such as
lecture notes) through map-based horizontal navigation . To
help learners navigate from lecture handouts to relevant online
tutorial pages, the Knowledge Sea system provided an
information map. Every cell of the map included links to similar
pages of open and closed corpus material, with adjacent cells
presenting less similar material. While the information map is still
the core of Knowledge Sea II, the system currently provides more
comprehensive information access through the addition of
information visualization, search, hypertext browsing, and direct
recommendation. In addition, it employs social navigation support
that is based on the learner’s previous interaction with the system.
2.1 Comprehensive Information Access
An important feature of the new version of Knowledge Sea II
(KSII) system is the support of several methods of information
access. One of our goals is to assess the practical usage of each
access method. Therefore in addition to traditional search service,
Knowledge Sea supports map-based information access, hypertext
browsing, and instructor recommendations. The following four
types of information access are available in Knowledge Sea II
(Figure 1):
1. Information visualization. Our traditional information map
provides access to hundreds of pages grouped into cells by
keyword-level similarity. Keywords and closed corpus
landmark are provided to help students find the most relevant
cells. When opened, each cell provides links to up to several
dozen similar resources. In the evaluation section of the paper
we refer to this access method as “Map”.
2. Hypertext browsing. Typically, a C programming Web tutorial
or textbook from KSII collection is organized as a tree of
sections connected by links. KSII preserves these links and
encourages learners to use them. Often students discover some
relevant page by using map or search and then continue to
explore the same tutorial along its own authored links.
Alternatively, students can start browsing from the root page of
each tutorial (root pages of all tutorials are listed on the front
page of the system). While pages of some tutorials are not
accessible through the map, every page in the system is
accessible through browsing.
3. Search. Students are able to perform standard keyword-based
search. Each search request returns a list of links to resources
ordered by relevance to the query. KSII uses a standard, vectorbased search engine. The detail of the search engine is out of
the scope of this paper.
4. Recommendation.
explicitly
recommended by the instructor. Links to these pages are added
to the list of resources for the corresponding lecture in the
course portal. We expected that it will be the easiest way for
students to access resources, since the portal is frequently used
for a range of educational activities. We refer to this method of
access as the “Instructor” method.
2.2 Social Navigation Support
Knowledge Sea II offers two kinds of social navigation support:
traffic-based and annotation-based. As we mentioned above,
traffic-based social navigation support was introduced in the first
version of KSII and annotation-based support was added in
the current version. This section presents state of social navigation
support in the most recent version of KSII that was used in our
Figure 1. Overview of different information access method in Knowledge Sea: visualization, browsing, and search.
2.2.1 Traffic-based Social Navigation Support
The idea of traffic-based social navigation support is to visualize
the navigational history of each group of learners. The intensity of
the background color of each cell on the map represents the
intensity of group traffic . The map starts with a very light
shade of blue for each cell and, as the students progress, more
frequently visited cells become darker and darker blue so that
students can easily follow the footprints of others by visiting cells
with darker backgrounds. Students can also view the history of
their own interaction with the system. The color of the “human”
icon shown in each cell reflects the number of cell visits done by
the individual student. The more visits, the darker the color of the
icon. In this way, students can compare their interaction with the
system with those of their total community members by
comparing the color of the human icon to the background color
(Figure 2). This information helps the students to decide what cell
to visit next.
Figure 2. A fragment of the Knowledge Sea map.
Figure 3. A fragment of a map cell with the list of resources.
When a student clicks on one of the cells of the map, the cell
“opens” and shows the list of available resources inside the cell.
Typically, behind each of these links is one section from a webbased C programming tutorial or book. Figure 3 presents a
fragment of one the map cells. The top part of the cell shows a
small map that presents the position of this cell in the Knowledge
Sea map and the top five keywords of the open cell. The bottom
part shows the list of resources. Each resource link has two parts:
the identification of the tutorial it belongs to (typically, the
author’s name, which also serves as a shortcut to the root of the
tutorial) and the title of the section.
A finer-grain traffic-based social navigation support is offered for
each resource inside the cell. The left hand side column of the list
of resources shows visual navigation cues that reflect individual
and group traffic information. The same visualization approach is
again being used here: the background color represents group
traffic and the color of the human icon, individual traffic. The
information in figure 3 shows that sections “Writing a Program”
and “More Complicated Decisions” of the R. Miles textbook are
quite popular among this group of students. We can also see that
the student for whom these cues were generated has visited
“Writing a Program” page more than the group and “More
Complicated Decisions” less than the group. More details about
traffic-based navigation support within the Knowledge Sea system
can be found in .
The same traffic-based adaptive visual cues are consistently
provided next to each resource link in KSII, in any context where
this link may appear, except for the course portal. The browsing
support component of the system dynamically processes all
tutorial pages and adds corresponding traffic-based cues to the
right of each link previously visited by the user of the group. For
example, Figure 4 shows a fragment of a tutorial page from the R.
Miles tutorial. All links on this page are created by the author and
were dynamically enhanced with adaptive visual cues at runtime.
Here we see, for example, the link to the same page “More
Complicated Decisions” that was shown inside map cell on Figure
Finally, to keep it consistent, the KSII search engine generates the
same traffic-based visual cues for each link when presenting
results of each search (Figure 5). The links on the search results
page are ordered by page relevance to the query. This relevance
score is calculated in a traditional way for a vector model and
shown to the right of each link (as it is done by a number of
search engines). The “social relevance” of links is expressed
solely by social navigation cues and is not used to calculate this
relevance. While existing content-based and collaborative 
adaptive search systems fuse the “raw” query relevance data with
user or group relevance data into a combined rank, we decided to
use two different approaches to show “raw” query relevance
(ordering) and social relevance (visual cues). This is done for both
– consistency and evaluation reasons. Indeed, keeping query
relevance and group relevance separated allowed us to compare
the value of both mechanisms in this study.

navigation support
2.2.2 Annotation-based Social Navigation Support
Annotation-based social navigation support is the newest feature
of Knowledge Sea that has been pioneered in the last version of
KSII. Based on student feedback collected during the evaluation
of the second version of the system, we attempted to provide a
more reliable form of social navigation support that would
supplement simple traffic information. Annotation-based support
harnesses the power of page highlighting and annotation made by
students. An important feature of the Knowledge Sea system is the
ability to annotate tutorial pages. Students are able to write notes
for each page and highlight different sections of the page while
reading each tutorial page. In addition to the personal benefits of
annotating while reading, which include helping the learners to
remember, clarify, and make sense of the material while trying to
reshape the information ; presence of annotation creates an
important trail for other learners to follow. AnnotatED, the
annotation component of Knowledge Sea, provides a rich set of
features to support annotating activity. Students can specify the
usefulness of the marked page by associating a positive, negative
or general type to their notes. Also they can specify whether or
not they want to share the notes with others and also if they want
to write the note anonymously or with their username. All this
information assists the author of the annotation and other learners
when they later consider access to the annotated material.
As can be seen in Figures 3, 4, and 5, some of the links are
enhanced with more than traffic information. The additional icons
are designed to support learners with more emphatic information,
based on annotations provided by this student and the group of
students. The “question mark” and “thumbs up” icons correspond
to a negative and a positive comment to this page made by the
current student. If a student writes a positive note for a page, the
link to that page will be augmented with a “thumbs up” icon in
any context where this link is shown. If a student writes a negative
annotation for a page, the page will be annotated with a “question
mark” icon. If a student has written a neutral note for a page, the
icon will show a sticky note. In this way the student can easily
locate previously annotated pages. In particular, it helps the
student to navigate back to pages that were previously found
useful and to ignore pages that were not considered to be
beneficial.
In addition, some of the links are annotated with a thermometer
icon. The thermometer icon presents the overall “annotation
temperature” of the page showing whether the page has received
more positive annotation or more negative annotation from the
group. If the thermometer shows a positive temperature, the page
has more positive annotations. If it shows negative (blue)
temperature, the page has overall received more negative
annotations. Therefore, the thermometer icon assists students in
deciding which pages to visit by recommending pages with
positive temperature and warning about pages with negative
temperature. For example, in Figure 3, the link to “R. Miles:
Writing a Program” is annotated with both a thumbs up icon and a
thermometer showing a low temperature. This means the current
student has found the page useful, but overall the page has
received more negative annotation than positive annotation. At
the same time, the page “Loops and Conditions,” which has not
been visited by the current student, has a high-positive annotation
temperature.
Similar to traffic-based visual cues, annotation-based cues also
apply the color-intensity paradigm to express information about
the density of annotations made by the group or the user. The
intensity of the yellow background color represents the density of
group annotation and the intensity of the foreground icon color
(thumbs up, question mark, or sticky note) represents the density
of the individual annotations.

3. EVALUATION
The new version of Knowledge Sea II with enhanced social
navigation and comprehensive information access was evaluated
in a classroom study during the Fall 2004 semester. The focus of
the study was the evaluation of social navigation support in its
assistance to students looking for important information. In
addition, we attempted to evaluate the importance of providing
multiple techniques of information access to the learners. The
system was made available to students of an introductory
programming course at the University of Pittsburgh. At the end of
the course, the students who used the system were asked to fill in
an anonymous questionnaire. The use of the system and the
questionnaire were not mandatory. Among 15 students enrolled,
13 used the Knowledge Sea system and 10 responded to the
questionnaire. This section presents the results of the students’
response analysis and the analysis of information access logs.
3.1 Usefulness of Providing Multiple Methods
to Access Information
To evaluate the importance of presenting multiple methods of
information access, we compared the frequency of student access
to different groups of resources – categorizing their location and
access type. Since the presence of a resource on the map and in
the list of links recommended by the instructor can seriously
influence the resource access profile, we attempted to calculate
the access profile separately for four main groups of links. Table 1
shows the number of resources in each of the categories. As we
see, among over 25,000 resources in the system, 894 are
accessible through the map and the rest, only by search and
browsing. Among 15 resources directly recommended by the
instructor, 13 are also available through the map. During the
semester we registered 825 accesses to 377 resources. The access
distribution over the four resource categories is shown in Table 2.
To compare the access rate to pages in different groups we
calculated the normalized access rate for each group by dividing
the number of accesses by the total number of pages in the group.
This parameter can be considered as the probability of accessing
each kind of page.
As the data shows, the documents directly recommended by the
instructor through the course portal have the highest access rate.
Given the small number of recommended documents and a oneclick access to them, this is the result we expected. Less expected
is the large effect of the information map. While all documents
can be equally accessed by browsing and search, documents that
are not present on the map have a dramatically smaller chance to
be accessed. This difference is very significant (p-value = 0.0001).
Even when the document is provided in the instructor’s list, the
map plays a role in increasing the chance of a visit (5.5 versus

As noted above, the profile of information access was calculated
separately for the following three categories of documents (Figure
Category 1: Documents in the list recommended by the
instructor. In this category we united all 15 recommended
pages, regardless of their presence on the map. 13 of these
pages were accessible through all four ways of information
access. As it can be seen in the first column of Figure 6, only
about 55% of the access to these pages is done through
“Instructor” method. The “Browsing” and “Map” method
each accounted for about 20% of the accesses and “Search”
for just 5% of the accesses. It shows the value of the
browsing and map method, even for documents that were one
click away from the course portal.
Category 2: Documents accessible from the map. This
category includes all documents accessible through the map,
search, and browsing, but not through recommended links.
Among 377 accessed pages, 193 pages belonged to this
category. As shown in the second column of Figure 6 about
60% of accesses to documents of this category were done
through the map, about 30% through browsing, and,
surprisingly, just 10% through search. As we expected, the
organized map is the easiest method for the students to
access information. In our system the power of the map was
enhanced since it is easy to to follow the footprints of others
by visiting cells with darker backgrounds and student
annotations.
Category 3: Documents not accessible from the map. This
category includes 24,555 documents that were accessible
only by search and browsing. Since search is the main access
methods in digital libraries, we expected that most of the
pages in this category would be accessed by search.
However, surprisingly, only 10% of the accesses were done
through search and the rest were done through browsing.
Figure 6 - Comparison of different accessing methods
We have also looked at the top 20 accessed documents and
checked the most frequently used access methods for these
documents. Overall, the top 20 accessed documents were accessed
214 times. As shown in Table 4, again the map method generated
the highest percentage of accesses, followed closely by the
browsing method. This shows that finding information through
the socially annotated map and browsing are the two favorite ways
for the students to navigate, even surpassing the explicit
recommendations of the instructor.
Table 4. Accessing method for the top 20 accessed pages
Instructor
The least expected result of the study was the relatively low value
of search-based access. We have added search-based access in the
third version of the system, expecting that the ability to search
would at least double the use of resources. While the students
appreciated the search-based access, only about 10% of accesses
were done through search, making it the least useful method of
information access for our students. The low value of search can
be also be observed by counting the number of students who used
search at least once while working with Knowledge Sea. Out of
13 students who used Knowledge Sea during the semester, only 7
students used search at all. We think that our data clearly shows
how critical it is to provide different methods of information
access in digital libraries, in order to complement the traditional
search-based access.
3.2 The Usefulness of Social Navigation
Support: Questionnaire Answers
To evaluate the usefulness of social navigation support, we looked
at student responses to the survey questions regarding social
navigation support.
One set of questions asked the students to agree or disagree with
statements about the usefulness of the following features related
to annotation-based social navigation support:
Density of public annotations made by the total group of
students is represented by darkness of the background color
Temperature of the tutorial pages represents the overall
number of positive and negative annotations, and is
presented in the thermometer icon.
Individual evaluations in the form of specific tutorial page
annotations is represented by thumbs up, question mark or
sticky note icons.
As can be seen in the first three columns of Figure 7, in all cases
more than 70% agree or strongly agree that these features were
useful. The champion is the annotation temperature: all students
agreed that the presence of the thermometer helps them to decide
what page to visit next.
Figure 7 - Students' attitude towards annotation based social
navigation
We also asked students about the usefulness of adding social
navigation support into the search result. The last column in
Figure 7 shows that 80% of students found useful the addition of
social navigation support to search results.
Another set of questions asked students about specific ways to
display group traffic and user traffic on the Knowledge Sea map
and inside pages and cells. As presented in Figure 8, at least 70%
of the students agreed or strongly agreed that the current way of
presenting traffic-based social navigation on both the map and
inside pages is useful and appropriate. The highest agreement was
on the presentation of group traffic on the Knowledge Sea map
(90%) - probably because different shades of blue are more easy
to distinguish on the map, thus helping students to choose the
next cell they wish to visit on the map.
Figure 8. Student attitudes toward the presentation of
traffic-based social navigation
3.3 The Usefulness of Social Navigation
Support: Log Analysis
3.3.1 Does Social Navigation Support Lead Students
to “Good” Pages?
Using system logs, we analyzed the correlation of the importance
of the pages with our traffic-based navigation support. Our gold
standard for rating the importance of pages is by what student find
good and important. Therefore, we look for pages with positive
annotations made by students. To start with, annotations tagged
by students as praise are considered positive annotations. In
addition, looking into our data, we have observed that students
often generally write a lot of very positive annotation (Out of 45
general notes written over 2 semesters, 26 can be considered as
positive annotations). Therefore, we consider annotations tagged
by student as general but positive in content to be positive
annotations as well. To assess our traffic-based navigation
support, we looked at the navigation behavior of the students over
the “good and important” pages.
Out of over 25000 documents available in the Knowledge Sea
system 377 documents have been accessed by the students during
the study. Out of 377 documents, 38 documents have been
annotated by last semester’s students while another 36 have been
annotated over previous semesters the system was used.
Therefore, a total of 74 documents out of 377 have been annotated
by students. Out of these 74, 36 documents have positive
annotations and positive temperature. Figure 9 shows the
normalized access rate for pages with and without annotation as
well as pages with positive annotations. As can be seen in the
figure, “good and important” pages are accessed twice as often.
Thus page traffic average is a good indicator of page quality.
“Good and important” pages will have a generally darker
background, according to our traffic-based social navigation
support algorithm. It is interesting to note that the number of
clicks on pages with positive annotations is not higher than pages
with any other kind of annotation, which means that pages with
positive annotations would not necessarily have darker
backgrounds.
Figure 9. Average click number over pages with different
annotation status
3.3.2 Do Students Take Social Navigation Cues into
Account When Selecting Resources?
Social navigation cues could lead students to good pages.
However, do the students ever notice these cue and take them into
account when selecting tutorial pages? To answer this question,
we looked at the effect of the presence of public annotation on the
page-visiting behavior of students. We compared the percentage
of page accesses done before and after the first public annotation
was made on each page. To have a more accurate result, the
percentage of activity was normalized over the number of possible
days for activity. As can be seen in Figure 10, in most cases, more
than 50% of accesses were made after the page was first marked
with a public annotation. Out of 34 pages with public annotations,
28 pages have been visited more after the first public annotation
was made. As we expected, this result suggests that public
annotation attracts the attention of students and influences their
decision about which page they should visit next.
Figure 10. Percentage of activity before and after the first
public annotation, for pages with public annotations
For better assessment of effect of social navigation on navigation
behavior, we compared the normalized access rate for pages with
different statuses. The status of a page includes information about
the number of clicks before the current access, the number of
public annotations made before the current access, and the
temperature of annotations before the current access. Figure 11
shows that social navigation support, which is related to page
status, has an important effect on students’ navigational choices.
As mentioned above, the normalized access rate is computed by
dividing the number of accesses to pages in this category by the
total number of available pages in this category. Table 5 shows
how the normalized access rate is computed for each status. As
the data shows, the chance of visiting an arbitrary resource in
KSII is very low (close to 0) since there is a large number of
resources in the system. Social navigation support and specifically
annotation-based social navigation increases the chance of
accessing a resource dramatically.

3.3.3 Does It Make Sense to Annotate Search Result
with Social Navigation Cues?
We have also assessed the effect of social navigation support on
how the search results are used. We expected that students will
prefer pages with visible group traffic and public annotations. We
also hoped that the students may prefer socially annotated pages
even if they are located relatively low on the results page. As
Table 6, the number of pages visited from links within the search
result is, indeed, higher when these links have icons showing
group traffic than when no group traffic is represented. On the
other hand, the average rank (position in the list of results) of
pages with group traffic is lower than pages without group traffic,
which means that selected pages with group traffic were located
higher in the list than selected pages with no traffic. For selected
pages with “strong” social navigation cues such a high traffic
(indicated by dark blue) or annotations the average rank is even
lower (Tables 6 and 7). This result shows that students preferred
pages that have two evidences of quality – lower rank (higher
relevance score) and presence of social navigation cues.

Since the “simple” approach to determine the value of social
navigation cues in the search interface provided little insight, we
had to use a more advanced approach. We decided to compare
effective and random relative access rate for links with low rank
(on the top of the list) and links with traffic-based cues. The
random relative access rate tells which fraction of clicks will be
made on links with a specific property if the user selects links in
the search results list randomly. Basically, it shows how often the
links with this property appear in the search results list. The
effective relative access rate reports the real fraction of links with
the target quality among all accessed links. If the effective relative
access rate is higher than random, it means that the links with this
quality encourage user to access them. If the effective relative
access rate is lower than random, it means that the links with this
quality discourage user from accessing them.
The first question to answer is “do students prefer links with low
rank” (we consider top three documents in the search results list
with rank 1 to 3 as low ranked). Since every result page shows 20
links, the random relative access rate for top three ranked
documents is 3/20 = 0.15. Effectively, students accessed 53
documents from different search results lists and out of these 53,
16 were among the top 3 documents. Therefore the effective
relative access rate is 16/53=0.3, which is twice the random
(0.15). This is evidence that the students do take the document
rank into account preferring links on the top of the list (one may
say that this is a rather obvious result).
The second question to answer is “do students prefer links with
traffic-based social navigation cues”. Answering this question we
attempted to evaluate separately links with any visible past traffic
(number of past clicks >1) and links with higher traffic (number
of past clicks >2). The reason is that the links with one past click
were annotated with a very light blue color, which, we afraid,
some users might ignore. The color for links with two clicks was
darker and clearly visible. The links with 3 and more past clicks
were annotated with reasonably dark blue color and were hard to
Computing random relative access rate for links with group traffic
was a complicated procedure. For each of the 53 cases of link
access we had to re-create the group traffic accumulated at the
time of access to understand how many links with social cues the
user saw when making the selection. For each case we calculated
the random relative access rate by dividing the number of links
with target level of traffic to the total number of links. Then we
averaged the probabilities over all 53 cases and found that for
pages with visible traffic the random relative access rate is equal
to 0.08 (Table 8). Out of 53 cases, students choose 17 documents
from the visible traffic category. Therefore the effective relative
access rate for links with visible traffic is 17/53=0.32, which is
four times higher than random access (0.08). Similar ratio (0.05 to
0.19) was obtained for links with high traffic. This result shows
that students do prefer links with visible group traffic. Moreover,
the ratio of their effective access rate to random is twice as higher
for pages with visible traffic than for pages in the top of the
results list. It provides evidence that pages with visible group
traffic are more attractive to students than top pages returned by
the search engine.

4. CONCLUSIONS and FUTURE WORK
In our Knowledge Sea II system, we have attempted to help
students access resources that are the most relevant and useful to
them, by providing multiple techniques of information access and
enhancing these techniques with social navigation support. We
think that our study provides a convincing argument for the
importance of presenting multiple methods of information access
in educational digital libraries. Only about 10% of all resource
accesses were made through the traditional search interface. At
the same time, map-based access and hypertext browsing
accounted for the majority of accesses. In particular, map-based
navigation, which generated 44% of our student’s accesses,
should be considered an important addition to any EDL.
In addition, the study of Knowledge Sea presented some
promising results in favor of social navigation support. We have
observed that important pages receive larger number of clicks and
thus by providing traffic-based navigation support, we can draw
students’ attention toward important pages. We have also
observed that the presence of public annotation does influence
students’ navigation behavior and assists them in deciding which
page to visit next.
To obtain more reliable data about the value of social navigation
support, we need to explore this technique with a dramatically
larger number of users. One of our plans is to explore social
navigation support in the context of some broadly used EDL that
contains a larger number of resources and a diverse community of
users. We are very interested in collaborating with developers of
EDL who would also be eager to explore the addition of more
comprehensive personalized information access to their resources.
