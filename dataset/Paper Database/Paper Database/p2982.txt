The 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak has been treated as a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization. This work made an early prediction
of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China based on a simple mathematical model and limited epidemiological
data. Combing characteristics of the historical epidemic, we found part of the released data is unreasonable.
Through ruling out the unreasonable data, the model predictions exhibit that the number of the cumulative
2019-nCoV cases may reach 76,000 to 230,000, with a peak of the unrecovered infectives (22,000-74,000)
occurring in late February to early March. After that, the infected cases will rapidly monotonically decrease
until early May to late June, when the 2019-nCoV outbreak will fade out. Strong anti-epidemic measures
may reduce the cumulative infected cases by 40%-49%. The improvement of medical care can also lead to
about one-half transmission decrease and effectively shorten the duration of the 2019-nCoV.

I. INTRODUCTION
Since December 31 2019, the 27 cases of unknown
pneumonia were reported in Wuhan City of Hubei Province
in South China . On 7 January 2020, Chinese government and the World Health Organization (WHO) identiﬁed
a novel coronavirus as the causative virus,
which belongs to the same virus family of the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that outbroke also in South
China in 2002-2003 . The 2019-nCoV spread rapidly
across most regions in mainland China after 17 January 2020
and leaded to over 7000 infectious cases at the end of
January (Fig. 1a). The number of the ﬁrst-month cumulative
cases of the 2019-CoV has exceeded the total number of
the SARS cases in 2003, suggesting this novel virus has
stronger infectivity than the SARS virus. Since about 23 Jan
2020, the Chinese Government has taken strong measures

to prohibit the virus’s transmission, such as warning citizens from going outdoors, temporarily suspending the public
transport between some big cities, and even taking quarantine
for the main infected city. These unprecedented measures
were expected to effectively stop the virus transmission
and buy necessary time to deploy medical resources to the
affected area. At the same time, considering the virus having
exported to other countries, including Thailand , Japan ,
South Korea and the United States of America ,
the WHO has made decision on identifying the 2019-nCoV
outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern (PHEIC) .
The rapid spread of the 2019-nCoV may be due to multiple
causes. One cause is the lacking of information transparency
at the early stage of the epidemic outbreak. Releasing the epidemic information in a timely and accurate way is extremely
important for the anti-epidemic response of the public. The
authentic and transparent information could have prohibited
the spread of the 2019-nCoV at the early stage. The other

cause is the lacking of scientiﬁc diagnostic criterion for the
2019-nCoV. Rapid developing exact testing techniques for
a novel virus is very difﬁcult. In fact, the symptoms of the
2019-nCoV are highly similar to those of ﬂu. This aggravated the hardship of diagnosis. The last but not the least,
the lacking of an epidemic warning and prediction system lost
the opportunity to prohibit the epidemic spread at the initial
Under the background of the ongoing 2019-nCoV transmission, the epidemiological survey is extremely important
for stopping transmission by tracing the infectious pathways
and particularly identifying the super spreaders. But, the outbreak of the 2019-CoV is just coincident with the large-scale
population migration during the most important traditional
Chinese festival, which exacerbated the spreading of virus
and simultaneously greatly increased the difﬁculty of the
epidemiological investigation. So, on the other hand, monitoring and predicting the evolution of the epidemic becomes
extremely meaningful for the decision making against the
public health crisis. Mathematical modelling has gained more
attention and awareness in epidemiology and the medical sciences – . One family of these models is the dynamical
epidemic model called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR)
model . The SIR model originated from the study of
the plague almost one hundred years ago . Tremendous
advance has been achieved in dynamical epidemic model
since mid-20th century . In recent decades, some realistic
factors inﬂuencing the epidemic transmission were included
in the classic SIR model, such as the model considering
the incubation stage , the SEIRS model considering the
population age and the population exposed to epidemic ,
and the SIS model including birth and death of the susceptible . Some dynamical models were also designed
for speciﬁc epidemic. For example, the dynamical models
were designed to simulate spreading of HIV, SARS and
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) , – .
As the development of new methods, the complex network
and machining learning were combined with the dynamical
model and created a promising direction of the epidemic
prediction , .
The construction of the SIR model for an epidemic disease
needs determining several key parameters (e.g. the infection rate and the removal rate) empirically or statistically.
As was mentioned in the above, the family of the SIR model
has developed complex model to considering more detailed
classes of individuals, such as the exposed class and the
protection class . In general, the more realistic the model
is, the more precisive prediction the model can make. But,
the model considering more realistic factors needs more data
to deﬁne additional parameters. On the other hand, some
effort has also been made on simpliﬁed model. For example,
the well-known logistic equation was used of as the twocompartment ‘‘S-I’’ (Susceptible -Infectious) model, which
can be further included some stochastic processes in the
modelling of SARS . The above-mentioned researches
prove that the SIR-family models at different complex levels can well capture the basic mechanism of the epidemic
transmission.
In this study, we tried to present an early prediction of the
epidemic of the 2019-nCoV based a simpliﬁed SIR model.
The rationality of the available epidemiological data was analyzed ﬁrstly so as to obtain the reasonable estimation of the
key parameter, i.e., infection rate. Focusing on the infection
rate and removal rate, several experiments were designed to
simulate the spreading of 2019-nCoV under different levels
of anti-epidemic measure and medical care. The prediction
intervals of the infective number and its inﬂection point,
as well as those of the cumulative infected cases and the
fading-out time of the epidemic, were presented. Our results
are supposed to provide important information for the crisis
management against the novel coronavirus.

II. DATA AND METHODS
The 2019-nCoV data used in this study has several
sources, including: (1) Wuhan Municipal Health Commission ( providing infective data in
Wuhan from December 31, 2019 to January 19, 2020;
(2) Health Commission of Hubei Province ( 
gov.cn/), providing the latest epidemiological data in Hubei
Province from January 20, 2020 up to the present, including cumulative conﬁrmed cases, deaths, suspected cases,
and cures in cities of Hubei Province; (3) National
Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China
( providing the latest epidemiological data of China from January 20, 2020 up to the present. The
data of SARS is obtained from WHO ( 
It provides epidemiological data all over the world from
March 17, 2003 to July 11, 2003 .
B. SIMPLIFIED SIR MODEL
Under the assumption of no change of population due to other
causes and considering a disease that confers immunity after
recovery, we can divide the population into three distinct
classes: the susceptibles (S), namely the healthy population
vulnerable to infection; the infectives (I), the infected population; and the removed infectives (R), the population has no
transmissibility including the recovered and dead infectives.
The population of the three classes is governed by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations :
dS/dt = −βS (t) I (t)
dI/dt = βS (t) I (t) −γ I (t)
dR/dt = γ I (t)
where t is time (in day); β the infection rate, i.e., the infected
ratio by one infective during unit time; and γ the removal
rate, i.e., the ratio of the removed number to the number of the
infectives. Equations (1-3) are coupled through the two righthand-side (RHS) terms: βS (t) I (t), i.e., the newly increased
infectives; and γ I (t), i.e., the newly removed infectives. For
Eq. (1), the solution of S generally follows a function monotonically decreasing to a stable ﬁnal value until the epidemic
fading out . The initial value of S is given empirically
according to the community population affected by the disease. But, the 2019-nCoV outbroke in Wuhan, a big city with
population over ten million. The high population density and
frequent population mobility made it hard to exactly estimate
the susceptible population in Wuhan, let alone the whole
mainland China. Therefore, we assume that the infected population of the 2019-nCoV can be omitted with compared
to the huge susceptible population in China. That is to say,
we can treat the variable S as a large constant with compared
to the variable I. With this assumption, Eq. (1) can thus
be dropped out from the coupled system Eq. (1-3). For the
rest two-equation system, i.e., Eqs. (2-3), the change of the
infectives (I) is thought to be more important for epidemic
prediction than the removed infectives (R). So, we can further
drop Eq. (3) and lead to a single-equation system, i.e., Eq. (2).
In the ﬁnite-difference form, Eq. (2) can be discretized as
I (t + 1t) = I (t) + (β −γ ) I (t) 1t,
where 1t is the time interval of numerical integration, and
the constant S is combined into the infection rate β with the
deﬁnition of
β (t) = [I (t + 1t) −I (t)] / [I (t) 1t]
And, the removal rate γ is similarly deﬁned as
γ (t) = [R (t + 1t) −R (t)] / [I (t) 1t]
In Eq. (4), the two parameters, β and γ , need to be set before
performing model prediction. In real epidemic transmission,
the infection rate β is a time-varying variable that can be
statistically estimated via ﬁtting the epidemiological data.
In principle, the parameter γ can be also estimated in the
similar way. Equation (4) with the deﬁnitions of β and γ can
be temporally integrated forward. Here, we use MATLAB to
realize the simple numerical computation of Eq. (4). Based
on the prediction of I, the removed infectives can be obtained
by γ I (t). With the numbers of I and the removed infectives,
we can further obtain the cumulative number of infected cases
by simply summing I (t) and γ I (t).
C. METHOD OF PARAMETER ESTIMATION
As was mentioned in previous section, the 2019-nCoV and
SARS belongs to the same family of coronavirus. Here,
we assume the two kinds of viruses both follow the basic
rule of epidemic transmission. From the knowledge of epidemic transmission , the variable I follows a bell-shaped
function, i.e., increasing from zero to a turning point and then
decreasing to a stable value; the variable S and R, respectively,
follow the monotonically decreasing and increasing functions
until reaching their stable states. This requires the parameter
β and γ satisfying a monotonically decreasing and increasing
function, respectively. So, this is one key criterion to ﬁt the
parameters in practice.
The infection rate (β) and removal rate (γ ) can be obtained
statistically or empirically. For the early prediction discussed
here, we should ﬁrstly evaluate the reliability of the available
data with combing the knowledge of the historical epidemic,
such as SARS in 2003. To do this, several subsets of the
epidemiological data are extracted by resampling from the
available data. We tried to identify the reasonable subsets of
epidemiological data for the model prediction via evaluating
the reasonability of the ﬁtted infection rate (β) from different
subsets of data. In the objective analysis of data, there are two
criterions used to rule out the unrealistic dataset. One is that
the ﬁtted parameter β should be monotonically decreasing
with time, otherwise, the modelled epidemic will not stop
unless all the susceptibles become infectives. This extreme
situation is particularly impossible for the epidemic spread
over an area like China, which has large spatial scale and
huge susceptible population. The other rule-out criterion is
VOLUME 8, 2020
L. Zhong et al.: Early Prediction of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak in the Mainland China
the ﬁtted β exhibits unrealistically sharp decrease, which
will let model signiﬁcantly underestimate the epidemic transmissibility and predict much less infectives than the real
data. Through investigating the characteristics of the ﬁtted
infection rates based on different data subsets, we can obtain
the reasonable estimates of β according to the above two
criterions.
For the parameter γ , it generally varies slowly at the initial
stage of the epidemic outbreak because most infectives have
not yet reached the recovery stage. So, the ﬁtted γ based on
the early epidemiology data is bound to be underestimated,
and thus cause unrealistically long duration of the epidemic
spread. Thus, we here treated the parameter γ as a constant
with referring to the removal rate computed from the real data.
After we obtaining the reasonable ranges of the two parameters, we can out sensitivity experiments with respect to the
parameter intervals to ﬁnd the prediction intervals of the
infectives and associated variables.
III. RESULTS
Although the 2019-nCoV is a member of the coronavirus, the
2019-nCoV still shows some different characteristics from
SARS. Figure 1a shows the number of infectives (I) and
the SIR prediction of the SARS over Mainland China during
10 April 2003 to 24 June 2003 . The simpliﬁed SIR model
(Eq. (4)) well depicts the propagation of the SARS in 2003.
In contrast, the 2019-nCoV shows a pulse-like increase of
infected cases after day 10. As shown by Table 1, the epidemiological data that can be used by the model was released since
11 January 2020 although some cases of unknown pneumonia
have been identiﬁed earlier. During 11 January −15 January,
the cumulative infectives keeps unchanged at 41 cases, i.e.,
zero infection rate (β) in the ﬁrst 5 days. But, on 18 January,
the infectives (121 cases) is almost doubled, which causes
a pulse-like infection rate of 1.44 per day. The huge change
of the infection rate seems not to be explained as the natural
variation of the epidemic. The sharp increase of the conﬁrmed
infected cases at such a short time may be attributable to
the improvements of the government emphasis on the disease and the diagnosis technique. Therefore, the data before
18 January should be used with caution. Since then, all the
provinces of China began to continuously release and update
the epidemiological data. It is supposed that the data after
that day is more reliable to reﬂect the characteristic of the
2019-nCoV.
As shown by Table 1 and Fig. 1b, the infection rate of the
2019-nCoV is over 0.5 per day in most of time after 17 January. That means every two 2019-nCoV infectives can infect
at least one person per day. This rate is more than the doubled
infection rate of the SARS in 2003 (Fig. 1b). Therefore, from
the initial epidemiological characteristics, the 2019-nCoV
virus exhibited a much stronger infectivity than the SARS
virus. This feature was also reported by some latest model
studies of 2019-nCoV , . As was mentioned in the
above, the infection rate is a key parameter determining the
prediction of the epidemic spread based on the SIR model.
TABLE 1. The epidemiological data of the 2019-nCoV: the cumulative
number of the infected individuals (I), the cumulative removed infectives
(R), the infection rate (β ) and the removal rate (γ ). The Removed
infectives include the dead and cured infectives.
In order to predict the future infective number, the infection
rate is often speciﬁed as a constant or a time-varying analytical function. For SARS, 2019-nCoV and other epidemics,
treating the infection rate as a time-varying variable can
capture the dynamical process of the epidemic transmission,
including the natural processes and the human intervention.
As the ﬁtted line shown in Fig. 1b, the infection rate of
the SARS in 2003 well satisﬁes a monotonically decreasing
exponential function, particular after day 20. This analytical
function of β is then substituted into Eq. (4) to make epidemic
prediction. Figure 1a shows that the predicted the evolution
of the infective number of 2003-SARS is highly consistent
with the real data (Fig. 1a).
For the 2019-nCoV, considering the poor quality of the
epidemiological data of the 2019-nCoV before 18 January,
we extracted several subsets from the available epidemiological data shown in Table 1 via sequentially excluding the
data between 11 January to 20 January in one-day interval.
Thus, we can obtain the ten subsets successively named by
the ﬁrst day of the extracted data, i.e., t0 = Jan −11,
t0 = Jan −12, ..., t0 = Jan −20. The dataset t0 =
Jan −11 means all of the released data since 11 January is
extracted, and t0 = Jan −20 for the data after 19 January.

FIGURE 2. The infection rate of the 2019-nCoV: (a) the infection rate (β(t))
of the 2019-nCoV (red circles) and the linearly fitted lines; (b) the same as
(a) but for the exponentially fitted infection rate with the unrealistic
fitting curves dashed.
These subsets of data are then used to ﬁt β functions of
the 2019-nCoV. Therefore, we totally got 10 linear functions
and 10 exponential functions of β, as shown in Fig. 2. Ten
straight lines in Fig. 2a are those ﬁtted by linear regression
model. It is found that the positive slopes of the ﬁt lines are
obtained based on the datasets before 16 January. After that
day, the negative slopes for β are ﬁtted. With the knowledge of the historical epidemic, the parameter β has to be a
constant or satisfy a monotonically decreasing function. The
increasing β will lead to unrealistic growth of the infectives
that cannot converge to a stable state. So, the data before
16 January should be ruled out from the analysis. The rest ﬁve
linear functions, namely from t0 = Jan −16 to t0 = Jan −
20, can be substituted into the model Eq. (4) for temporal
integration.
On the other hand, the above results of 2003-SARS
(Fig. 1b) show the parameter β well satisﬁes a slowly
decreasing exponential function. Similarly, we also tried to
exponentially ﬁt the 2019-nCoV infection rate. As shown by
Fig. 2b, the ﬁtted β exponential functions also show large
differences between different subsets of data. The uncertainties are largely caused by the data quality. It was found that
all the ﬁtted functions using the data before 14 January (t0 =
Jan−11 to t0 = Jan−13) are monotonically increasing, which
can be ruled out according the above-mentioned criterions.
The estimations of t0 = Jan −16 to t0 = Jan −18 have
steep downward slopes due to the pulse-like increase of β
between 17 Jan-18 Jan,, which may result in unrealistically
strong prohibition of the infective number. On the contrary,
the unrealistic increase of the predicted infectives may be
caused by the β function with slow decreasing speed (t0 =
Jan −14) or large base infection rate (t0 = Jan −15). Only
the two β functions (t0 = Jan −19 and t0 = Jan −20) seems
to have appropriate slopes and base values. The reasonability
of the β functions from subset t0 = Jan−14 to t0 = Jan−20
will be further discussed in Fig.3a.
Recalling the simpliﬁed SIR model (Eq. (4)) is jointly
determined by β and γ . So, we also computed the values of the removal rate (γ ) based on the available data.
As shown in Table1, the mean value of γ is about 0.04,
which means four out of one hundred infectives are cured
or dead per day. It is also found that the parameter γ stays
around 0.02 with weak decreasing trend after 17 January, but
ﬂuctuates in large amplitude between 0.1 and 0.2 before that
day. This dramatic change of the removal rate also reﬂects the
unnatural inﬂuence mentioned above. But for the data after
17 January, the low removal rate with the decreasing trend
may be attributable to that most infectives have not yet
ﬁnished the whole course of the disease. So, at the initial
stage of the epidemic outbreak, few fully recovered or dead
infectives is not enough to exactly ﬁt the function of the
removal rate. The slightly downward trend of γ (Table 1) will
lead to a monotonically decreasing function and thus extreme
overestimation of the infected cases by model prediction. So,
instead of setting a varying removal rate, this work speciﬁes γ
as a constant. The sensitivity experiments (ﬁgure not shown)
to γ were performed under the two β functions (t0 = Jan−19
and t0 = Jan −20) (Fig. 2b). With compared to the available real data, the hindcasting infective number is obviously
overestimated under γ
< 0.03 but underestimated under
γ > 0.09. So, we set γ as 0.05-0.07 to keep it away from
the two threshold values.
Using the β functions ﬁtted in Fig. 2 and the constant γ ,
we can further perform the model prediction. In order to simplify the problem, we only select the two linear β functions,
i.e., the line with minimal (t0 = Jan −16) and maximal
(t0 = Jan −20) negative slopes in Fig.2a, to represent the
change interval of the linear functions of β. In addition, all
the β functions shown in Fig. 2b are substituted into Eq. (4).
Figure 3a demonstrates the predictions of the infective number (I) based on the β functions shown in Fig. 2 with moderate
removal rate (γ = 0.06). For the exponentially increasing
(t0 = Jan −11 to Jan-13) and too weakly decreasing (t0 =
Jan −14) β functions, too strong infection rate will cause
VOLUME 8, 2020
L. Zhong et al.: Early Prediction of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak in the Mainland China
the exponentially increase of the infected cases, i.e., unstable
solution, an extremely unrealistic prediction. For But for the
β functions with too steep downward slopes (t0 = Jan−16 to
Jan-18), the model predicts unreasonably low infected cases,
which is much lower than that from the contemporaneous
real data. The above discrepancies are mainly caused by
some unrealistically high infection rates due to pulse-like
increase during 17-18 January (Table 1). For the same reason,
the β function of Jan-15 is also ruled out from the model
prediction to completely eliminate the inﬂuence of the false
data on the infection rate although the predicted result seems
reasonable (Fig. 3a).
For the linear β functions in Fig. 2a, the corresponding prediction interval shows unrealistic low infected cases, whose
peak value is only slightly higher than the real infective
number at the initial stage of 2019-nCoV. The predicted
duration (30-40days) of the epidemic spread also seems
too short with compared to the 2003-SARS, which shows
lower infection rate but longer duration (about 70 days)
(Fig. 1a). Thus, we can infer that the linear regression
model is an inappropriate model for ﬁtting the infection rate
of 2019-nCoV.
With the above discussion, we ﬁnally retained only two
experiments, i.e., those including t0
19 −Jan and
t0 = 20 −Jan exponential β functions from Fig. 2b. In fact,
these two experiments, respectively, correspond to the high-
(t0 = 19 −Jan) and low- (t0 = 20 −Jan) infection-rate
experiments, which can also be understood as the low- and
high-level anti-epidemic measures against the virus transmission in model simulation, respectively. Under the moderate
value of γ (Fig. 3a), the infected of 2019-nCoV will reach
its peak value in late February to early March and fade out
completely in late May. The anti-epidemic measure seems
to have on signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the fading-out date but
have strong effect on the number of the infected cases. The
peak of the infected cases may reach 3,2000 under high-level
prevention measure, but 46000 under the low-level measure.
From Fig. 3c, the strong anti-epidemic measure can reduce
about 44% cumulative infected cases under the moderate
removal rate.
With the truth that the death cases account for only small
part of the removed infectives, the change of the removal
rate can be approximately attributed to the factors against
virus replication inside human body, such as the improvement of the medicine or therapy. Here, we set the levels
of removal rate as γ = 0.05, 0.06,0.07 to represent low,
moderate and high medical levels. Combined with the two
anti-epidemic levels deﬁned by β function shown in Fig. 2a,
i.e., t0 = 19 −Jan and t0 = 20 −Jan of exponential
β functions, we totally get six scenarios of the 2019-nCoV
propagation in Figs. 3b, c. With compared to low-level antiepidemic scenarios (t0 = 19 −Jan), the strengthened measures (t0 = 20 −Jan) reduce the peak infected cases by
47%, 42% and 38%, and the cumulative cases by 49%, 44%
and 40% under low, moderate and high medical levels (γ ),
respectively.

outbreak under the same γ . However, the increase of γ
is more effective in prohibiting the infected number. It is
estimated from the model predictions that every increase of
the removal rate in 1γ = 0.01 (about 16%-20%) will lead
to 50%-60% decrease of infected cases (Fig. 3b), and 40%-
50% decrease of cumulative cases (Fig. 3c). Furthermore,
large removal rate or high-level medical care signiﬁcantly
shortens the duration of the epidemic outbreak. Under the
t0 = 19 −Jan function of β, the model with γ = 0.06
predicts the 2019-nCoV will fade out in late May. But under
γ = 0.07 and the same β function, that fading-out time is
advanced to early May (Fig. 3b). This reﬂects the tendency
of the epidemic is highly sensitive to the medical-service
level. High-level medical care can signiﬁcantly prohibit the
propagation of the epidemic situation.
Considering all the sensitivity experiments with respect
to β and γ , the prediction intervals of the 2019-nCoV are
concluded in Table 2. The inﬂection point of the infected
case variation is a key indicator for the epidemic transmission monitor. In theory, the inﬂection point of I(t) can be
obtained by simply setting dI/dt = 0 in Eq. (2), i.e., the
time point satisfying βS(t) = γ . Recalling the infection
rate is a monotonically decreasing function, the turning point
of I(t) is thus determined by the variation of the magnitude
contrast between the infection rate and the removal rate. From
the experiments under different sets of β and γ (Fig. 3b
and Table 2), the inﬂection point of 2019-nCoV will occur
in late February to early March, when the number of the
unrecovered infectives will reach its peak value of about
43,000 cases with the variation interval between 22,000 and
74,000. After the inﬂection point, the number of the infected
cases will decrease rapidly until the epidemic has faded out
in late April to late June. On the whole, the 2019-nCoV
epidemic may persist three to ﬁve months. From Fig. 3c
and Table 2, the ﬁnal cumulative infected case will reach
about 140,000 varying in the interval of 76,000-230,000,
which reﬂects three-fold difference between the most optimized measure and the worst one. That is to say, the above
prediction intervals are strongly determined by the antiepidemic measures and the medical-service level against the
IV. DISCUSSION
It is hard to accurately predicting the epidemic evolution
based on limited data, especially in the condition of lacking reliable data. Although the 2019-nCoV outbreak can be
traced back to late December 2019 (perhaps earlier), the systematically released epidemiological data is only available
after 11 January 2020, among which the reasonability of the
data before 18 January 2020 is still unconvinced. So, until
the authors ﬁnished this work, the reliable data only covers
no more than two weeks, which may lead to large uncertainty in the early prediction of the 2019-nCoV outbreak.
But, the effort of the early prediction is still meaningful.
Mathematical models of different complexities have been
proved to be effective in predicting the evolution of epidemic
outbreak. But, the more complex the structure of the model,
the more parameters are needed to be determined. Under
the condition of lacking epidemiological data, it is hard to
objectively determine all the parameters. Too many unknown
parameters will bring large uncertainties in the model prediction. Based on the point, this work formulated a simpliﬁed
SIR model with the least parameters, i.e., the infection rate
and the removal rate, to reduce the uncertainty as much as
possible. The model shows good ability in hindcasting the
spreading of SARS in 2003. So, we further applied this model
to the 2019-nCoV.
Through eliminating the unreliable data via objective
analysis, we provided epidemic predictions under different
scenarios with respect to different-level anti-epidemic measure and medical care represented by the two model parameters, i.e., infection rate and removal rate. The predictions
are supposed to be a helpful guide to the decision making in coping with the ongoing 2019-nCoV transmission in
China. The strictness of the current quarantine measures and
infection control precautions employed by Chinese Government is historically unprecedented. So, as predicted by this
work, the control measures should pay more attention to the
medical-service aspects, such as accelerating the diagnostic speed and enhancing the hospitalization capacity. If all
the above efforts get the cumulative infected cases down
to below about 80,000 until late February (Fig. 3c), the
severity of the 2019-nCoV may be controlled at the relatively low level ﬁnally. The sensitivity of the simpliﬁedmodel prediction to the parameters also emphasized the
importance of the openness and transparency in releasing
the data relevant to the public health. As the progressing of the 2019-nCoV, more epidemiological data will be
available to verify and revise this early prediction of the
2019-nCoV.
