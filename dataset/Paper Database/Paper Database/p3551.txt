The severity of Helicobacter pylori-related disease is correlated with a pathogenicity island (the Cag region
of about 26 genes) whose presence is associated with the
up-regulation of an IL-8 cytokine inflammatory response in
gastric epithelial cells. Statistical analysis of the Cag gene
sequences calculated from the complete genome of strain
26695 revealed several unusual features. The Cag7 sequence
(1,927 aa) has two repeat regions. Repeat region I runs 317 aa
in a form of !
! proximal to the protein N terminal; repeat
region II extends 907 aa in the middle of the protein sequence
consisting of 74 contiguous segments composed from selections among six consensus sequences and includes 58 regularly distributed cysteine residues with consecutive cysteines
mostly 12, 18, or 24 aa apart. This ‘‘regular’’ cysteine arrangement may provide a scaffolding of linker elements stabilized
by disulfide bridges. When Cag7 homologues from different
strains are compared, differences were found almost exclusively in the repeat regions, resulting from deletion andyor
insertion of repeating units. These observations suggest that
the anomalous repetitive structure of the sequence plays an
important role in the conformation of Cag7 gene product and
potentially in the function of the pathogenicity island. Other
facets of the Cag7 sequence show significant charge clusters,
high multiplet count, and extremes of amino acid usage.
Helicobactor pylori (HP) is a Gram-negative spiral-shaped
bacterium that colonizes the human stomach. About 50% of
humans are infected by HP but only 10% exhibit clinical
disease, including chronic gastritis, gastric carcinoma, and
peptic ulcer (1). The more severe forms of disease are associated with infection by specific strains called type I. Two type
I HP strains have been sequenced in their entirety [strains
26695 (2) and J99 (3)]. Virulent HPs differ from less virulent
strains (type II) by the presence of a ;40-kb block of genes
called the Cag pathogenicity island (abbreviated Cag PAI or
CagA region; ref. 4). No specific function is established for any
gene from the Cag island. However, Cag-positive, but not
Cag-negative, strains cause cultured gastric epithelial cells to
secrete the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 (4,5), and this
ability is abolished by specific mutation of many of the 26
ORFs found in the Cag island (4–6). Several of these genes are
modestly similar to genes of other pathogens that encode
subunits of specialized type IV secretory systems that directly
deliver bacterial virulence factors to the surface and possibly
into host cells. Control of bacterial virulence often is mediated
by changes at the DNA sequence level that affect gene
regulation or expression (7). Three Cag PAI now have been
sequenced from the complete genomes of strains 26695 and
J99 and the sequenced cosmid 36 from strain NCTC11638. All
three contain an unusual ORF (annotated Cag7 or HP527 in
strain 26695), which is significantly variable among HP pathogenic strains, but no mechanisms for this variation have been
proposed and no features of the Cag7 sequence have been
noted to account for the origin of this variation.
We present here a rigorous statistical analysis of the Cag7
protein (1,927 aa) from strain 26695. Of particular interest, we
underscore several sequence features of this protein, including
distinctive repeat patterns, a remarkable cysteine residue
distribution, a statistically significantly high multiplet count
(defined below), a pronounced charge residue cluster (8, 9),
extremes of lysine and glutamate amino acid usage, and
identification of hydrophobic potential transmembrane segments. Expansion or contraction of the repeats could account
for the size variations seen in the ORF of Cag7.
Unusual Sequence Features of Cag7. The SAPS (Statistical
Analysis of Protein Sequences) program (8) was applied to all the
putative proteins encoded from the CagA region of strain 26695.
This analysis reveals several unusual sequence features especially
for the Cag7 protein, which was found to contain two impressive
regions composed of contiguous repeated amino acid sequences.
Repeat I. Repeat I (Fig. 1), covering amino acid positions 9-325
inclusive, in the pattern !!*!**, has ! (130 aa) aligned with !*
(130 aa), showing only three mismatches and !** (57 aa), a
truncated copy of !*, which matches perfectly over their common 57 aa and, more impressively, in perfect DNA agreement.
Remarkably the ! and !* differ at only three DNA positions,
which all occur in codon site 1. There are no synonymous (silent
site) substitutions. The almost perfect DNA identities comparing
! to !* or !** strongly suggest a recent origin to these repeats.
Repeat II. Repeat II (Figs. 2 and 3) consists of 74 contiguous
segments composed from selections among six different consensus sequences, which we call a, b, l, m, d, «, stretching over
amino acid positions 477-1383. The underline signifies perfect
conservation of the amino acids at that position among the
ensemble of sequences of a, of b, etc.

The explicit order of the subsequences of repeat II is
displayed next:
~l!-~t1-«-l!-~t2-«-l!-
~a-«-l!-~b-d-m!-~a-«-l!-~b-d-m!-~a-d-m!-

~b-d-m!-~a-d-m!-~a!.
The sequences t1 and t2 in the above pattern each begin with
a cysteine but significantly differ from the consensus sequences
a and b, respectively. Each specific a unit aligns substantially
with the consensus a, each b unit aligns substantially with the
consensus b, etc. The main repeat units occur as triplet groups
of sequences of the form
The d sequences invariably are followed by a m sequence, «
sequences are followed invariably by a l sequence, b sequences
are followed by d sequences, whereas a sequences are followed
by either « or d sequences. It is worth emphasis that DNA
conservation in these repeats among the a, b, d, etc. is very
high (see Fig. 3 for m).
Regular cysteine residue spacings. Cag7 contains 58 cysteine
residues scaffolding repeat II. To underscore the regular
distribution of the cysteine residues, we display their spacings.
(The notation C-12-C signifies that the positions of the two
successive cysteines are 12 residues apart, C-18-C indicates
that the two cysteines are 18 residues apart, etc.):
H2N-443-C-9-C-22-C-12-C-24-C-12-C-28-C-12-C-18-C-12-
C-23-C-12-C-18-C-12-C-23-C-12-C-25-C-12-C-24-C-12-C-

C-25-C-14-C-23-C-12-C-34-C-15-C-430-COOH.
We see that there is no cysteine of Cag7 among the initial 443
residues nor in the terminal 430 residues. Otherwise, the
cysteines are principally 12 positions apart or sometimes about
18 or 24 positions apart. This cysteine arrangement may
implicate a distinctive three-dimensional structural conformation in this part of the protein, probably stabilized by a plethora
of disulphide bridges. This cysteine arrangement differs from
other classical cysteine arrangements, including kringle patterns, epidermal growth factor domains, fibronectin structures,
and zinc fingers.
Comparisons of the Cag7 Sequence Among Different HP
Strains. There are three HP strains from which the CagA
region is wholly sequenced. These are available from the
complete genome strain 26695, complete genome strain J99,
and cosmid 36 strain NCTC 11638 (6). The alignments of the
Cag7 protein from the three sources are represented in Fig. 4.
Cag7 matches excellently the two genes ORF14 and ORF13
of cosmid 36 when encoded together with their intervening
sequence. The correspondence with ORF14 possesses a deletion of 130 successive residues near the N terminal of Cag7,
whereas ORF13 aligns almost perfectly with the C-terminal
quarter of Cag7. Notably, the initial ! of repeat I in Cag7 is
the 130-residue segment missing from ORF14. The sequence
intervening ORF13 and ORF14 is replete with nonsense
codons. However, in introducing a frame shift (skip a guanine
at nucleotide position 24186) relative to the cosmid 36 sequence, the amino acid sequence resulting from this translation aligns almost perfectly with the middle part of Cag7, but
for an absent block of 69 aa. The missing part is equivalent to
the two repeat triplet groups of repeat II in Cag7, those of
sequences (a-«-l)–(b-d-m) corresponding to amino acid positions 1114-1182 of Cag7. These alterations suggest that the
number of repeat units may be part of the mechanism regulating the expression, conformation, andyor function of the
protein. We also guess that the 11 frame shift serves to
regulate the expression of Cag7-like genes among different
strains, which conceivably also controls the virulence of the
bacterium. When the frame shift is present, ORF14 and ORF13
merge into one protein, which is more than 90% identical with
Cag7, but with six consecutive repeat subunits missing. When
the frame shift is removed, ORF14 and ORF13 lose most of
repeat II.
The Cag7 ortholog jhp0476 in strain J99 compared to Cag7
(HP0527) in parallel with cosmid 36 misses ! of repeat I
whereas the unit !** is 16 aa longer than its counterpart in
Cag7. Repeat II of jhp0476 as with cosmid 36 is missing the
same triplet groups (a-«-l)–(b-d-m). On the other hand, repeat
II in jhp0476 extends 78 aa longer augmented by two triplet
groups. The DNAs of these two proteins align with 87%
Possible Role of the Repeat Regions of Cag7 in Pathogenicity. The repeat lengths of repeats I and II among different
strains of HP are markedly variable with different numbers of
! in repeat I and generally different numbers of repeat units
composing repeat II. In fact, comparative analysis of a panel
of strains of Cag7 homologues using PCR proceeding from
common primers flanking the repeat regions attest experimentally to significant variation in the length of repeats I and
II from strain to strain but not in the same strain passed in vitro
or in vivo (in the mouse) over time (T.M. and S.F., unpublished
data). Consistent with these lines, a survey of HP Cag7 analogs
in a collection of several primate isolates revealed significant
polymorphism in the repeat I and repeat II lengths. The
Alignment of amino acid sequences of !, !*, and !** in repeat I. Matching residues are indicated by dots. ! and !* differ at three
residues; !** is 73 aa shorter than ! or !*. !** matches exactly with !* over their common 57 residues. The numbers to the right of the sequences
give their coordinates within the Cag7 protein. DNA conservation with respect to ! and !* differ only at codon site 1 of the altered aa. !* and
!** are identical at the DNA level in their common sequence.

dramatic DNA identity within the repeat structures putatively
generated through recombination or replication strand slippage allows opportunities for changes in the repeat length.
Different lengths may produce alternative protein conformations or serve to switch the protein’s expression on and off,
thus affording the HP bacterium a means to confound host
immune system surveillance.
Significantly High Multiplet Count in the Cag7 Sequence. A
measure of the homopeptide density of a protein sequence is
provided by the multiplet count, i.e., the number of distinct
homooligopeptide runs of two or more residues. Specifically,
multiplet counts refer to the number of homopeptides in
protein sequences counting all homodipeptides XX(5X2),
homotripeptides YYY(5Y3), homotetrapeptides Z4, etc.,
where X, Y, Z denotes any amino acid. A statistical assessment
of the counts and locations of these multiplets compares the
observed multiplet set to the multiplet distribution in a random
(shuffled) reconstruction of the protein sequence. A significance test of high multiplet counts would take account of the
amino acid composition of the protein sequence under study
and is described in Karlin et al. (12). The scarce occurrence of
proteins in possession of an abundance of amino acid multiplets stands out in Escherichia coli and in most prokaryotes.
The percentage of human proteins with significantly high
multiplet counts is about 1.5% with similar percentages observed in mouse and yeast. A greater number of proteins with
significantly many multiplets is detected in Drosophila (about
10%), usually associated with developmental regulatory genes
(13). Strikingly, Cag7 in HP (strain 26695) and HP (strain J99)
is the only protein sequence of HP that carries a significantly
high multiplet count. In the case at hand, the bulk of the
multiplets concentrate in the two repeat regions (see Fig. 5),
Repeat II in the Cag7 protein extends continuously from amino acids 477-1383. The sequences of a, b, d, «, l, and m are aligned, and
the consensus sequences are displayed at the top. Residues that appear the same number of times at one position both are displayed in the consensus
sequence indicated by a colon. Note that the sequences of a, b, l, and m start with a cysteine. Lowercase letters represent nonaligned residues.
The , underneath the K locates the terminal point of ORF14 in cosmid 36 and the @ underneath the m locates the start point of ORF13 in cosmid
36. The conservation index (defined below) among the sequences of a is 0.82; among the sequences of b, 0.79; among the sequences of d, 0.81;
among the sequences of «, 0.60; among the sequences of l, 0.68; and among the sequences of m, 0.78. The conservation index (10) provides a means
to quantitate similarity among aligned sequences. A similarity score between a pair of amino acids is determined according to a similarity substitution
matrix, say BLOSUM 62 (11). Normalized scores for an amino acid pair (a and b) are calculated by the formula
ÎS~a, a! 3 S~b, b! ,
where S(a, b), S(a, a), S(b, b) are similarity values given by the BLOSUM 62 matrix. For each position (column) of these sequences, the conservation
index is calculated by taking the average normalized score from all residue pairs at that position.

where a preponderance of lysine and glutamate doublets KK
and EE (or EEE) appear (see Discussion for possible implications).
It is interesting that significantly high multiplet counts are
also present in the genes containing the PGRS repeats of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis contemplated also as pathogenicity islands (14, 15). The human neurological disease genes
associated with long trinucleotide CAG (glutamine) iterations
and other long amino acid runs also are correlated with high
multiplet counts (13).
Potential Transmembrane Segments in Cag7. The Cag7

hydrophobic uncharged runs, traversing coordinates 343-370

carboxyl end.
DISCUSSION
In the CagA region of the HP genome strain 26695, the Cag7
(HP527) gene is replete with unusual sequence
features. This gene has been noted by other researchers
because of its marginal sequence similarity to the virB10 family
(percent similarity about 30%) of type IV secretory genes and
its necessity for HP’s induction of IL-8 secretion in gastric
epithelial cells and the strain-to-strain variation in size. We
have found that this variation occurs within two repeat regions
in the Cag7 protein. The amino end of Cag7 is distinguished
by the long tandem repeat !!*!** (total length 317 aa). The
middle part of Cag7, repeat II, covering amino acid positions
477-1383 consists of 74 subsequences selected from six consensus sequences a (generally 14 aa), b (14 aa), l (13 aa), m
(13 aa), d (10 aa), and « (5 aa) (see previous text or Fig. 2 for
the explicit sequences). The DNA identity among different
representations of the consensus sequences is very high. Other
strains of HP maintain polymorphic versions of repeats I and
II associated strictly with variation in repeat subunits. The
published sequences of Cag7 (HP527) with homologues from
two other strains suggest that the strain-to-strain variation
could be explained by recombination within the gene mediated
by repeat subunits or can, in part, result from replication strand
slippage. The three strains also may reflect on Cag7 variation
among separate population sources. Thus, strain 26695 comes
from a United Kingdom individual, strain J99 comes from a
United States individual, and cosmid 36 (strain NCTC11638)
was sequenced from an Australian individual. The extent over
time of Cag7 variation from a single strain has not been
adequately ascertained.
Aligned DNA sequences corresponding to the amino acid
sequences of group m are displayed. 1 indicates a position strictly
conserved among these sequences, and , indicates a position with
average conservation index (CI, defined in Fig. 2 legend) exceeding
0.6. The scores for nucleotide comparisons are as follows: identity has
value 1, a transition replacement (A 7 G or C 7 T) has value 0.3, a
substitution A 7 T or G 7 C has value 20.3, and a substitution A 7
C or G 7 T has value 20.5. The average CI for these sequences over
all columns is 0.8, and 87% of the columns show a CI value above 0.6
emphasizing a high level of conservation.
The Cag7 protein sequence is aligned with the translated protein in cosmid 36 combining ORF14, ORF13, and the intervening part
requiring a single base (11) frame shift after amino acid 682 (counting from the N terminus of ORF14). When introducing the frame shift the
DNA sequence encodes a protein that, apart from two gaps, aligns more than 90% with Cag7. The first gap corresponds to amino acids 9–138 of
Cag7, consisting of unit !, the second gap corresponds to amino acids 1114–1182, consisting of two consecutive repeat triplet groups, namely
(a-«-l)–(b-d-m) (see text). The Cag7 ortholog jhp0476 in strain J99 is displayed below Cag7. The jhp0476 sequence is missing a segment equivalent
to ! of Cag7, and the unit corresponding to !** is 16 aa longer. The same two consecutive triplet groups missing from cosmid 36 also are missing
from jhp0476, whereas the repeat II in jhp0476 extends longer by 78 aa augmented by the two successive triplet groups (d-m-a)–(d-m-a). The Cag7
and jhp0476 can be divided into three parts corresponding to ORF14, ORF13, and the intervening piece in cosmid 36. The , locate two significantly
long uncharged (potential transmembrane) segments, the first traversing amino acid positions 343–370 downstream proximal to repeat I and the
second segment of positions 1836-1870 is near the C terminus. 1 corresponds to a concentrated charge region. The arrows indicate the extent and
orientation of the ORFs.

Apart from the striking repeat patterns, Cag7 is extraordinary in other sequence attributes, including high multiplet
count, significant charge clusters (not shown), several extreme
amino acid usages, and potential of transmembrane segments.
Issues and potential experiments to be considered are:
(i) What part of Cag7 is necessary for virulence? The frame
shift in the intervening region between ORF14 and ORF13 of
cosmid 36 converts the ORFs into an almost complete homologue of Cag7. The polymorphism resulting from variations of
the repeat numbers and lengths may enhance or curtail
interactions with the host and serve as a means of shielding the
bacterium from an immune system attack. The changes in the
repeat numbers may affect how the Cag7 protein surface looks
to the immune system and thereby may avoid recognition by
antibodies made during previous infections. The almost perfect DNA identities within repeats I and II strongly argues for
rather recent changes in repeat numbers. These repeat patterns may indicate a facility of HP for allowing rapid changes
prompted by some host immune attacks.
(ii) The regular distribution of cysteine residues in repeat II
provides a possible scaffolding involving disulfide bridges
cross-linking secondary structures andyor domains of the
protein structure. It would be informative to synthesize a
triplet unit of the repeat II, say a-«-l andyor b-d-m, and
evaluate its secondary structure in an aqueous medium.
(iii) The role of repeats in protein sequences is generally
unclear. They may be benign, arising through replication
strand slippage or recombination. They may provide flexibility
and variation to protein conformation and function in response
to environmental stress or host surveillance. They may contribute a regulatory role in gene transcription, translation, and
expression. They may facilitate binding capacities in protein–
protein and protein–DNA interactions. The pattern of repeat
II, coupled to the regular cysteine distribution and an abundance of KK and EE diresidues, may contribute to several of
these activities.
(iv) The high multiplet count of Cag7 is dominated by lysine
and glutamate doublets, that are especially rife in repeat region
II. These conceivably provide opportunities for multiple salt
bridges, facilitating conformational stability andyor contributing to protein–protein interactions andyor quaternary structure formations (16).
(v) The main question about Cag7 is what is its function? Its
similarity to secretory genes (virB10 family) of other species
and its necessity for IL-8 secretion would support the idea that
it is a component of a secretory apparatus that delivers a
product or products that induces the IL-8 response. The virB10
gene has been proposed to play a regulatory function of the
type IV secretory system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (17). It
is noteworthy that the portion containing the repeat regions is
absent from members of the virB10 family in all other sequenced species. These observations suggest that the repeat
regions and their contractions and expansions play key regu-
The 177-aa multiplets (see text for details) and their distribution in Cag7 are shown. Most of these multiplets occur in the two repeat
regions of positions 9-325 and 477-1383, respectively.
