Abstract. Predicting TNM stage is the major determinant of breast
cancer prognosis and treatment. The essential part of TNM stage classiﬁcation is whether the cancer has metastasized to the regional lymph
nodes (N-stage). Pathologic N-stage (pN-stage) is commonly performed
by pathologists detecting metastasis in histological slides. However, this
diagnostic procedure is prone to misinterpretation and would normally
require extensive time by pathologists because of the sheer volume of
data that needs a thorough review. Automated detection of lymph node
metastasis and pN-stage prediction has a great potential to reduce their
workload and help the pathologist. Recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown signiﬁcant improvements in histological
slide analysis, but accuracy is not optimized because of the diﬃculty
in the handling of gigapixel images. In this paper, we propose a robust
method for metastasis detection and pN-stage classiﬁcation in breast
cancer from multiple gigapixel pathology images in an eﬀective way.
pN-stage is predicted by combining patch-level CNN based metastasis
detector and slide-level lymph node classiﬁer. The proposed framework
achieves a state-of-the-art quadratic weighted kappa score of 0.9203 on
the Camelyon17 dataset, outperforming the previous winning method of
the Camelyon17 challenge.

Introduction
When cancer is ﬁrst diagnosed, the ﬁrst and most important step is staging of the
cancer by using the TNM staging system , the most commonly used system.
Invasion to lymph nodes, highly predictive of recurrence , is evaluated by
pathologists (pN-stage) via detection of tumor lesions in lymph node histology
slides from a surgically resected tissue. This diagnostic procedure is prone to
misinterpretation and would normally require extensive time by pathologists
because of the sheer volume of data that needs a thorough review. Automated
detection of lymph node metastasis and pN-stage prediction has the potential
to signiﬁcantly elevate the eﬃciency and diagnostic accuracy of pathologists for
one of the most critical diagnostic process of breast cancer.

In the last few years, considerable improvements have been emerged in the
computer vision task using CNN . Followed by this paradigm, CNN based computer assisted metastasis detection has been proposed in recent years .
However, recent approaches metastasis detection in whole slide images have
shown the diﬃculty in handling gigapixel images . Furthermore, pN-stage
classiﬁcation requires handling multiple gigapixel images.
In this paper, we introduce a robust method to predict pathologic N-stage
(pN-stage) from whole slide pathology images. For the robust performance, we
eﬀectively handle multiple gigapixel images in order to integrate CNN into pNstage prediction framework such as balanced patch sampling, patch augmentation, stain color augmentation, 2-stage ﬁne-tuning and overlap tiling strategy.
We achieved patient-level quadratic weighted kappa score 0.9203 on the Camelyon17 test set which it yields the new state-of-the-art record on Camelyon17
leaderboard .

Methodology
Fig. 1 shows the overall scheme of our proposed framework. First, ROI extraction
module proposes candidate tissue regions from whole slide images. Second, CNNbased metastasis detection module predicts cancer metastasis within extracted
ROIs. Third, the predicted scores extracted from ROI are converted to a feature
vector based on the morphological and geometrical information which is used to
A Robust and Eﬀective Approach for pN-stage Classiﬁcation
build a slide-level lymph node classiﬁer. Patient-level pN-stage is determined by
aggregating slide-level predictions with given rules .
Regions of Interests Extraction
A whole slide image (WSI) is approximately 200000×100000 pixels on the highest
resolution level. Accurate tissue region extraction algorithms can save computation time and reduce false positives from noisy background area. In order to
extract tissue regions from the WSIs, Otsu threshold or gray value threshold
is commonly used in recent studies . We decide to use gray value threshold
method which shows superior performance in our experiments.
Metastasis Detection
Some annotated metastasis regions include non-metastasis area since accurate
pixel-level annotation is diﬃcult in gigapixel WSIs . We build a large scale
dataset by extracting small patches from WSIs to deal with those noisy labels.
After the ROIs are found from WSIs as described in Section 2.1, we extract
256×256 patches within ROIs with stride 128 pixels. We label a patch as tumor if
over 75% pixels in the patch are annotated as a tumor. Our metastasis detection
module is based on the well-known CNN architecture ResNet101 for patch
classiﬁcation to discriminate between tumor and non-tumor patches.
Although the proposed method seems straightforward, we need to eﬀectively
handle gigapixel WSIs to integrate CNN into pN-stage prediction framework for
the robust performance, as described below.
Balanced Patch Sampling The areas corresponding to tumor regions often
covered only a minor proportion of the total slide area, contributing to a large
patch-level imbalance. To deal with this imbalance, we followed similar patch
sampling approach used in . In detail, we sample the same number of tumor/normal patches where patches are sampled from each slide with uniform
distribution.

Patch Augmentation There are only
400 WSIs in Camelyon16 dataset and 500
WSIs in Camelyon17 train set. Patches
sampled from same WSI exhibit similar
data property, which is prone to overﬁtting. We perform extensive data augmentation at the training step to overcome
small number of WSIs. Since the classes of histopathology image exhibit rotational symmetry, we include patch augmentation by randomly rotating over
angles between 0 and 360, and random left-right ﬂipping. Details are shown in

Augmentation
combat the variety of hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained color because
of chemical preparation diﬀerence per
slide, extensive color augmentation is
performed by applying random hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast as described in Table 2. CNN model becomes robust against stain color variety by
applying stain color augmentation at the training step.
2-Stage Fine-Tuning Camelyon16 and Camelyon17 dataset are collected from
diﬀerent medical centers. Each center may use diﬀerent slide scanners, diﬀerent
scanning settings, diﬀerence tissue staining conditions. We handle this multicenter variation by applying the 2-stage ﬁne-tuning strategy. First, we ﬁne-tune
CNN with the union set of Camelyon16 and Camelyon17 and then ﬁne-tune
CNN again with only Camelyon17 set. The ﬁne-tuned model becomes robust
against multi-center variation between Camelyon16 and Camelyon17 set.

prediction
probability heatmap is generated by the
trained CNN based metastasis detector. A straightforward way to
generate a heatmap from WSI is
separating WSI into patch size
tiles and merging patch level predictions from each tile. However,
this simple strategy provides insuﬃcient performance. Instead, we
use similar overlap-tile strategy 
for dense heatmap from tiled WSI.
As shown in Fig. 2, the probability heatmap generated by overlaptile strategy provides denser heatmap than straightforward tiling strategy even
though the same classiﬁer is used. By default, we used 50% overlapped tiles
shown in Fig. 2(c).
Lymph Node Classiﬁcation
To determine each patient’s pN-stage, multiple lymph node slides should be classiﬁed into four classes (Normal, Isolated tumor cells (ITC), Micro, Macro). For each
lymph node WSI, we obtain the 128× down-sampled tumor probability heatmap
through the CNN based metastasis detector (Section 2.2). Each heatmap is converted into a feature vector which is used to build a slide level lymph node
classiﬁer. We deﬁne 11 types of features based on the morphological and geometrical information. By using converted features, random forest classiﬁer 
A Robust and Eﬀective Approach for pN-stage Classiﬁcation
is trained to automatically classify the lymph node into four classes. Finally,
each patient’s pN-stage is determined by aggregating all lymph node predictions
with the given rule . We followed the Camelyon17’s simpliﬁed version of the
pN-staging system (pN0, pN0(i+), pN1mi, pN1, pN2) .
Experiments
We evaluate our framework on Camelyon16 and Camelyon17 dataset.
The Camelyon16 dataset contains 400 WSIs with region annotations for all its
metastasis slides. The Camelyon17 dataset contains 1000 WSIs with 5 slides per
patient: 500 slides for the train set, 500 slides for the test set. The train set
consists of the slide level metastasis annotation. There are 3 categories of lymph
node metastasis: Macro (Metastases greater than 2.0 mm), Micro (metastasis greater
than 0.2 mm or more than 200 cells, but smaller than 2.0 mm), and ITC (single tumor
cells or a cluster of tumor cells smaller than 0.2mm or less than 200 cells).

Since the Camelyon17 set
provides only 50 slides with
lesion-level annotations in train
set, we split 100 patients (total 500 WSIs since each patient provides 5 WSIs) into
Camelyon17 train-M set to train
metastasis detection module,
Camelyon17 train-L set to train lymph node classiﬁcation module. In detail, if patient’s any slide include lesion-level annotation, we allocate that patient as a
Camelyon17 train-M set. Other patients are allocated as a Camelyon17 train-L
set. As shown in Table 3, our split strategy separates similar data distribution
between them in terms of the medical centers and metastasis types.
Evaluation Metrics
Metastasis Detection Evaluation We used the Camelyon16 evaluation metric on the Camelyon16 dataset to validate metastasis detection module performance. Camelyon16 evaluation metric consists of two metrics, the area under
receiver operating characteristic (AUC) to evaluate the slide-level classiﬁcation
and the FROC to evaluate the lesion-level detection and localization.
pN-stage Classiﬁcation Evaluation To evaluate pN-stage classiﬁcation, we
used the Camelyon17 evaluation metric , patient-level ﬁve-class quadratic
weighted kappa where the classes are the pN-stages. Slide-level lymph node classiﬁcation accuracy is also measured to validate lymph node classiﬁcation module
performance.

Experimental Details
ROI Extraction Module For the type of ROI extraction between Otsu threshold and gray value threshold, we determined to use gray value threshold method
which is obtained a better performance on Camelyon16 train set. In detail,
we convert RGB to gray from 32× down-sampled WSI and then extract tissue
regions by thresholding gray value > 0.8.

Metastasis Detection Module During training and inference, we extracted 256×256 patches from WSIs
at the highest magniﬁcation level of
0.243 µm/pixel resolution. For training
of the patch-level CNN based classiﬁer,
400 WSIs from Camelyon16 dataset
and 160 WSIs from Camelyon17 train set are used as shown in Table 4. Total
1,430K tumor patches and 43,700K normal patches are extracted.
We trained ResNet101 with initial parameters from ImageNet pretrained
model to speed up convergence. We updated batch normalization parameters
during ﬁne-tuning because of the data distribution diﬀerence between the ImageNet dataset and the Camelyon dataset. We used the Adam optimization
method with a learning rate 1e-4. The network was trained for approximately 2
epoch (500K iteration) with a batch size 32 per GPU.
To ﬁnd hyperparameters and validate performance, we split Camelyon16
train set into our train/val set, 80% for train and 20% for validation. For AUC
evaluation, we used maximum conﬁdence probability in WSI. For FROC evaluation, we followed connected component approach which ﬁnd connected
components and then report maximum conﬁdence probability’s location within
the component. After hyperparameter tuning, we ﬁnally train CNN with all
given training dataset in Table 4.

Lymph Node Classiﬁcation Module We generated the tumor probability heatmap from WSI using the metastasis detection module. For the postprocessing, we thresholded the heatmap with a threshold of t = 0.9. We found
hyperparameters and feature designs for random forest classiﬁer in Camelyon17
train-L set with 5-fold cross-validation setting. Finally, we extracted 11 features
described in Table 5. We built a random forest classiﬁer to discriminate lymph
node classes using extracted features. Each patient’s pN-stage was determined
by the given rule with the 5 lymph node slide prediction result.

130 WSIs from Camelyon16 test set using the same evaluation metrics provided
by the Camelyon16 challenge. Table 6 summarizes slide-level AUC and lesionlevel FROC comparisons with the best previous methods. Our metastasis detection module achieved highly competitive AUC (0.9853) and FROC (0.8552)

pN-stage Classiﬁcation on Camelyon17 For validation, we ﬁrst evaluated
our framework on Camelyon17 train-L set with 5-fold cross-validation setting.
Our framework achieved 0.9351 slide-level lymph node classiﬁcation accuracy
and 0.9017 patient-level kappa score using single CNN model in metastasis detection module. We trained additional CNN models with diﬀerent model hyperparameters and ﬁne-tuning setting. Finally, three model was ensembled by averaging probability heatmap and reached 0.9390 slide-level accuracy and 0.9455
patient-level kappa score with the 5-fold cross-validation.
Next, we evaluated our framework on the Camelyon17 test set and the kappa
score has reached 0.9203. As shown in Table 7, our proposed framework significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by large-margins where it
achieves better performance than the previous winning method (HMS-MGH-
CCDS) of the Camelyon17 challenge.
Furthermore, the accuracy of our algorithm not only exceeded that of current
leading approaches (bold black color in Table 8) but also signiﬁcantly reduced
false-negative results (red color in Table 8). This is remarkable from a clinical
perspective, as false-negative results are most critical, likely to aﬀect patient
survival due to consequent delay in diagnosis and appropriate timely treatment.

Conclusion
We have introduced a robust and eﬀective method to predict pN-stage from
lymph node histological slides, using CNN based metastasis detection and random forest based lymph node classiﬁcation. Our proposed method achieved the
state-of-the-art result on the Camelyon17 dataset. In future work, we would like
to build an end-to-end learning framework for pN-stage prediction from WSIs.
