Dynamic Monopolies of Constant Size

February 13, 2017
This paper deals with a polling game on a graph. Initially, each
vertex is colored white or black. At each round, each vertex is colored
by the color shared by the majority of vertices in its neighborhood, on
the previous round. (All recolorings are done simultaneously). We say
that a set W0 of vertices is a dynamic monopoly or dynamo if starting
the game with the vertices of W0 colored white, the entire system is
white after a ﬁnite number of rounds. Peleg asked how small a
dynamic monopoly may be as a function of the number of vertices.
We show that the answer is O(1).
Introduction
Let G = (V, E) be a simple undirected graph. Let W0 be a subset of V .
Consider the following repetitive polling game. At round 0 the vertices of
W0 are colored white and the other vertices are colored black.
round, each vertex v is colored according to the following rule. If at round
r the vertex v has more than half of its neighbors colored c, then at round
r + 1 the vertex v will be colored c. If at round r the vertex v has exactly
half of its neighbors colored white and half of its neighbors colored black,
then we say there is a tie. In this case v is colored at round r + 1 by the
same color it had at round r. (Peleg considered other models for dealing
with ties. We will refer to these models in section 3.) If there exists a ﬁnite
r so that at round r all vertices in V are white, then we say that W0 is a
dynamic monopoly, abbreviated dynamo.
In this paper we prove
Theorem 1 For every natural number n there exists a graph with more
than n vertices and with a dynamic monopoly of 18 vertices.
We shall use the following notations: If v ∈V then N(v) denotes the set
of neighbors of v. We call d(v) = |N(v)| the degree of v. For every r = 0, 1 . . .
we deﬁne Cr as a function from V to {B, W}, so that Cr(v) = W if v is
white at round r and Cr(v) = B if v is black at this round. We also deﬁne
r (W), Br = C−1
r (B), Tr = Wr ∩Wr−1(r > 0) and Sr = T1 ∪. . .∪Tr
Proof of Theorem 1
Figure 1: The graph J. (The small black circles are the vertices c0 . . . c11.
They are drawn small because they are too dense.)
Let J = (VJ, EJ) be the graph in ﬁgure 1. Let
W0 = {w0, . . . , w9, x0, . . . , x2, y0, . . . , y4}
and let U = W0 ∪{q} and D = VJ −U. We construct a graph Jn by
“duplicating” n times the vertices in D. That is,
Jn = (Vn, En)
Vn = U ∪[n] × D
En = {(u, v) ∈J : u, v ∈U} ∪{(u, (i, v)) : (u, v) ∈J, u ∈U, v ∈D, i ∈[n]}
∪{((i, u), (i, v)) : (u, v) ∈J, u, v ∈D, i ∈[n]}
(Here, as usual, [n] denotes the set {1 . . . n}).
Note that for reasons of symmetry, at a given round, all copies of a
vertex in J have the same color. Thus we may write “y0 is white at round
3” instead of “(i, y0) is white at round 3 for every i ∈[n]” etc.
The following table describes the evolution of Jn. The symbol 1 stands
for white and 0 stands for black. Note that the table does not depend on n.
(This property is peculiar to the graph J. In general graphs duplication of
vertices may change the pattern of evolution of the graph).

The table shows that at round 20 the entire system is white and therefore
W0 is a dynamo. The reader may go through the table by himself, but in
order to facilitate the understanding of what happens in the table let us add
some explanations as to the mechanism of “conquest” used in this graph.
We say that round j dominates round i if Wi ⊆Wj.
We shall make use of the following obvious fact:
Observation 1 If round j dominates round i (i, j = 0, 1 . . . ) then round
j + 1 dominates round i + 1.
By applying this observation k times, we ﬁnd that if round j dominates
round i then round j+k dominates round i+k (i, j, k = 0, 1 . . . ). By looking
at the table one can see that in the graph Jn round 2 dominates round 0
and thus we have
Corollary 1 Round k + 2 dominates round k in Jn for every k = 0, 1 . . .
We say that a vertex v blinks at round r if Cr+2i(v) = W for every
i = 0, 1 . . . . We say that a vertex v is conquered at round r if Cr+i(v) = W
for every i = 0, 1 . . . .
Examining rounds 0 to 3 at the table and using
Corollary 1 one can see that x0, x1 and x2 are conquered at round 0, and
in addition q, w0, w1 and y0 are conquered at round 2. Furthermore, every
vertex in Jn blinks either at round 1 or at round 2.
Finally, we have
Lemma 1 If at round r a vertex v in Jn has at least half of its neighbors
conquered then v is conquered at round r + 2.
Proof: Every vertex in Jn blinks either at round 1 or at round 2, and
hence v is white either at round r + 1 or at round r + 2. From this round
on, at least half of the neighbors of v are white, so v will stay white.
Now the vertices will be conquered in the following order:
x0, x1, x2, q, w0, w1, y0, c0, e0, d0, y1, c1, c2, e1, w2w3, y2, c3, e2, e3, d1, y3, y4,
c4, c5, g0, g1, f, w4, w5, c6, d2, c7, c8, w6, w7, c9, d3, c10, c11, w8, w9,
a0, a1, a2, b0, b1.
Eventually, the entire graph is colored white. Jn is a graph with 19 +
27n > n vertices and W0 is a dynamo of size 18, proving Theorem 1.
Remark: The number 18 can probably be improved.
Questions and Remarks
The result of Section 2 gives rise to the following questions:
Question 1 Does there exist an inﬁnite graph with a ﬁnite dynamo?
The answer is no. This follows from the following theorem:
Theorem 2 If W0 is ﬁnite then Tr is ﬁnite for all r = 1, 2 . . . . Moreover,
every vertex in Tr has ﬁnite degree.
Proof: The proof is by induction on r. For r = 1 the theorem is true
because every vertex v ∈W0 with inﬁnite degree becomes black at round
For r > 1, if Cr−1(v) = W and v has an inﬁnite degree λ then by
the induction hypotheses Cr−2(v) = B and |N(v) ∩Br−2| < λ.
|N(v) ∩Wr−1| ≤|N(v) ∩Br−2| + |Tr−1| < λ and Cr(v) = B.
If v ∈Tr has a ﬁnite degree then v has a neighbor in Tr−1.
induction hypotheses only ﬁnitely many vertices have such a neighbor.
The next question deals with other models considered by Peleg:
Question 2 Do we still have a dynamo of size O(1) if we change the rules
of dealing with ties? (e.g. if a vertex becomes black whenever there is a tie.)
The answer here is yes. If G = (V, E) is a graph, introduce a new vertex
v′ for every v ∈V and consider the graph ˆG = ( ˆV , ˆE) where
ˆV = {v, v′ : v ∈V }
ˆE = E ∪{(u′, v′) : (u, v) ∈E} ∪{(v, v′) : 2|d(v)}
If W0 is a dynamo of G according to the model in Theorem 1, then it is
easy to prove that ˆ
W0 = {v, v′ : v ∈W0} is a dynamo of ˆG. But all vertices
of ˆG have odd degrees, and thus ties are not possible and
W0 is a dynamo
of ˆG according to any rule of dealing with ties.
Therefore, for every n = 1, 2 . . . the graph ˆJn has a dynamo of size 36.
Another Model
Let ρ > 1 be a real number.
Consider the following model, which will
henceforth be called the ρ-model. At every round, for every vertex v with
b neighbors colored black and w neighbors colored white, if w > ρb then v
is colored white at the next round, otherwise it is black. For the sake of
simplicity we will assume that ρ is irrational and that there are no isolated
vertices, so that w = ρb is impossble.
The most interesting question regarding this model is whether there exist
graphs with O(1) dynamo like in Theorem 1. This question is as yet open.
We only have some partial results, which can be summarized as follows:
i. If ρ is big enough then the size of a dynamo is Ω(√n).
ii. If ρ is small enough then there exist graphs in which the size of a
dynamo is O(log n).
iii. If there exist graphs with O(1) dynamo then the number of rounds
needed until the entire system becomes white is Ω(log n).
More explicitly:
Theorem 3 Let ρ > 3. If a graph with n vertices has a dynamo of size k
in the ρ-model then
For every r = 1, 2, . . . , let (Sr, Sr) be the set of edges with one vertex in
Sr and the other not in Sr. Call sr = |Sr| + |(Sr, Sr)|. Note that S1 is the
set of vertices which are white at both round 0 and round 1. Every v ∈S1
is connected to at most k −|S1| vertices in W0 \ S1 and at most k−1
vertices outside of W0. Therefore we have
s1 < |S1| + |S1|(k −|S1| + k −1) = k2 −(k −|S1|)2 ≤k2
Thus all we need is to show sr+1 ≤sr and we are done.
Let r be ﬁxed. By deﬁnition Sr ⊆Sr+1. Let ∆= Sr+1 \ Sr, and let
v ∈∆. More than 3
4 of the neighbors of v are white at round r and more
4 of the neighbors of v are white at round r −1. Thus more than 1
the neighbors of v belong to Sr. We therefore have
|(Sr, Sr) \ (Sr+1, Sr+1)| −|(Sr+1, Sr+1) \ (Sr, Sr)| ≥|∆|
which implies sr+1 ≤sr. By induction sr < k2 for all r. If we begin with a
dynamo then for some ﬁnite m we have Sm = V and n = sm < k2 ✷
Theorem 4 Let ρ > 1. If |W0| = k and Wm = V (the set of all vertices),
then the number e of edges in the graph satisﬁes
e < k2( 2ρ
Let dr denote the sum of the degrees of the vertices in Sr. Recall that
every v ∈S1 is white at both round 0 and round 1, and thus |N(v)∩B0| < k
and d(v) < k. Therefore, d1 < 2k2. Again, let r be ﬁxed, let ∆be as in
the proof of Theorem 3 and let v ∈∆. More than
ρ+1 of the neighbors of
v are white at round r and more than
ρ+1 of the neighbors of v are white
at round r −1. Thus more than
rho+1 of the neighbors of v belong to Sr.
Therefore, we have
dr+1 < dr + ρ + 1
By induction dr < 2k2( 2ρ
ρ−1)r−1. If the entire system is white at round
m then dm+1 = 2e and thus we have
e < k2( 2ρ
Theorem 5 Let 1 < ρ <
For every integer n > 5 there exists in
the ρ model a graph with more than 2n vertices and with a dynamo of size
30(n −5) + 36.
Figure 2: The upper graph in this ﬁgure is a part of ˆJ. The lower graph is
the corresponding part in ˜J. The rest of ˜J is identical to the rest of ˆJ.
Outline of proof:
Let ˆJ be as deﬁned in the answer to Question 2. Construct ˜J by eliminating f from ˆJ and connecting f ′ to y0 and g1 (but not to g0). Note that in
˜J the vertex g0 is connected only to y3 and to y4 (see in ﬁgure 2). Construct
˜J32, ˜J64, . . . ˜J2n as in the construction of Jn, where the duplicated vertices
are all black vertices except for q and q′. (Note that the graphs are constructed separately, namely, the sets of vertices of ˜J2i and ˜J2j are disjoint
for i ̸= j.) Now connect the graphs in the following way. First, eliminate
the copies of x0, x1, x2 from all graphs except for ˜J32. Note that in ˜J2i there
are 2i copies of g0 (when i = 5, . . . n −1). Divide them into 32 disjoint sets
P0, . . . P31, of size 2i−5 each. Now connect the vertices in P0 to the copy of
q in ˜J2i+1, connect P1 to the copy of q′, and connect each one of P2 . . . P31
to a respective white vertex in ˜J2i+1 (see in ﬁgure 3). It is possible to verify
the following:
i. All vertices of the obtained graph blink either at round 1 or at round
Figure 3: This ﬁgure illustrates the graph used in the proof of Theorm 5.
The vertices under the digit 1 are the 32 copies of g0 in ˜J32. Under the
digit 2 are the 32 unduplicated vertices in ˜J64 (q, q′ and the initiallly white
vertices). Under the digit 3 are the 64 copies of g0 in ˜J64, under the digit 4
are the 32 unduplicated vertices in ˜J128, under the digit 5 are the 128 copies
of g0 in ˜J128, and so on.
ii. All vertices of K32 are eventually conquered. (The evolution of this
conquest is similar to the one in Theorem 1.)
iii. If all copies of g0 in ˜J2i are conquered at a certain round, then all
vertices of ˜J2i+1 are eventually conquered. (Again, the evolution is
similar to the one in Theorem 1. Note that we need the bound ρ < 257
in order to have q and q′ conquered.)
Thus all vertices are eventually conquered. The theorem follows upon
noticing that our graph has more than 2n vertices, and the size of the dynamo
is 30(n −5) + 36. ✷
