We show that the purely ﬁrst-principles Weizmann-4 (W4) computational thermochemistry
method developed in our group can reproduce available Active Thermochemical Tables atomization
energies for 35 molecules with a 3σ uncertainty of under 1 kJ/mol. We then employ this method
to generate the W4-11 dataset of 140 total atomization energies of small ﬁrst-and second-row
molecules and radicals. These cover a broad spectrum of bonding situations and multireference
character, and as such are an excellent, quasi-automated benchmark (available electronically as
supporting information) for parametrization and validation of more approximate methods (such
as DFT functionals and composite methods). Secondary contributions such as relativity can be
included or omitted at will, unlike with experimental data. A broad variety of more approximate
methods is assessed against the W4-11 benchmark and recommendations are made.

INTRODUCTION
Over the last two decades there has been a proliferation in the number of approximate
theoretical methods, in particular density functional theory (DFT) and, to a lesser extent,
composite thermochemical procedures.
At present, the only validation for a given approximate method is benchmarking against
reference data with well-deﬁned error bars that are much smaller (preferably, by an order
of magnitude or more) than the intrinsic error of the method being evaluated. In addition,
many of these approximate methods include some adjustable parameters (in some cases,
dozens). In some cases (e.g., ), these can be determined from formal considerations
(e.g., obeisance of certain boundary conditions by an exchange-correlation functional). In
most other cases (e.g., ), parameters are adjusted for minimal RMS error over one or
more reference datasets, in which case accuracy of these reference data becomes even more
imperative. It is no less imperative, however, that these sets be as large and chemically
diverse as reasonably possible in order not to end up with a “gloriﬁed interpolation scheme”
through sample bias.
Historically, much work relied on various sets of thermochemical data derived from
experiment.
Most notably, this was the case in the Gn family of composite ab initio
methods developed by Pople and coworkers , and many researchers (the wildly popular
B3LYP method being the most famous example) relied on the datasets developed
by this group. (Most of the data were compiled from the JANAF tables and
their successor, the NIST WebBook .) The more recent CCCBDB initiative at NIST
must also be mentioned in this context. However, as time progressed, limitations of purely
experimental benchmark data became more apparent. These include but are not limited to:
• uncertainties in the measurements exceeding 1 kcal/mol except for a small subset. This
was a nonissue as long as intrinsic method errors were in the 5–10 kcal/mol range or
even greater (e.g., for semiempirical methods and simple GGA density functionals),
but with both composite ab initio schemes and more sophisticated density functional
methods, this becomes a signiﬁcant issue;
• the experimental data contain secondary contributions that are not included — or
cannot eﬃciently be included during parametrization — in the approximate models.
These range from relativistic eﬀects and anharmonic zero-point vibrational energies
for thermochemistry to tunneling and recrossing corrections for barrier heights;
• availability of reliable experimental data is unevenly spread both throughout the
periodic table and, more generally, the chemical universe.
For some types of
compounds of chemical interest, insuﬃcient data will be available, or even none at
all. In fact, the toxicity or excessive reactivity of some compounds may discourage or
preclude reliable measurements;
• as experimental chemical thermodynamics is no longer a fashionable research subject,
few new data are being generated.
High-accuracy ab initio methods have now reached a point where, for small molecules,
accuracies can be achieved that rival all but the most reliable experiments. For instance,
Weizmann-4 theory (W4) can, for total atomization energies (TAE values, P De)
of small molecules of the ﬁrst and second row of the Periodic Table, oﬀer data with 95%
conﬁdence intervals narrower than 1 kJ/mol, which is an order of magnitude better than can
be achieved with any present-day functional. The “competing” HEAT approach developed
by an international consortium of researchers oﬀers similar accuracy for ﬁrst-row
systems. Neither W4 or HEAT rely on any adjustable parameters derived from experiment.
(See also Refs. for related approaches.)
While datasets obtained from high-accuracy ab initio calculations can eminently serve as
“secondary standards” (to borrow a term from analytical chemistry), for the initial validation
of the methods, an even more accurate “primary standard” is imperative. Both W4 and
HEAT relied for this on comparatively small sets of very accurate experimental data obtained
from the Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT) thermochemical network developed
by Ruscic and coworkers.
A number of accurate reference datasets have been proposed in recent years, covering
a wide range of species and chemical properties.
For instance, Truhlar and coworkers
put forward benchmark sets for various types noncovalent interactions as well as,
notably, the HTBH38 and NHTBH38 (38 hydrogen- and nonhydrogen-transfer barrier
heights ) and especially DBH24 (Diverse Barrier Heights) dataset for thermochemical
kinetics. Hobza and coworkers put forward the widely employed S22 set of weak interaction
data .
Datasets have been advanced for alkane thermochemistry and alkane
conformer energies . Coming to the present subject our group proposed the W4-08
 dataset of 99 W4-level molecular TAEs covering the ﬁrst and second
rows, as well as spanning a broad range in terms of the severity of nondynamical correlation
These and other datasets were integrated into the GMTK30 general-purpose
reference dataset proposed by Grimme and coworkers .
(One noteworthy additional
component is a “mindless” benchmark of data for purely artiﬁcial structures, which
has the beneﬁt of being devoid of chemical bias.)
As computational resources expanded on the one hand, and additional ATcT data became
available on the other hand, we are in a position to signiﬁcantly extend our earlier work.
In this article we shall ﬁrst “re-establish” the reliability of Weizmann-4 theory against
a set of 35 highly accurate experimental atomization energies (with associated error bars
narrower than 0.05 kcal/mol) available from the Active Thermochemical Tables, ATcT,
paradigm of Ruscic et al.
We proceed by extending the W4-08 dataset
of 99 total atomization energies of small ﬁrst- and second-row species to include 140
atomization energies (with up to ﬁve heavy atoms), all of which are obtained by means
of the W4 (or higher) ab initio computational thermochemistry protocol. For the purpose of
testing/parametrizing more approximates electronic structure methods, the following subsets
of reaction energies are also formed: bond dissociation (99 reactions), heavy-atom transfer
(707 reactions), isomerization (20 reactions), and nucleophilic substitution (13 reactions).
Finally, we shall consider performance of a number of approximate methods. Our new W4-
11 dataset is made available in machine-readable form as electronic supporting information
to the present paper.
COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
All calculations were performed on the Martin group Linux cluster and on the Faculty
of Chemistry HPC facility at the Weizmann Institute of Science.
SCF, CCSD, and
CCSD(T) calculations were carried out using MOLPRO 2009.1 , while for post-CCSD(T)
calculations, the string-based general coupled cluster code MRCC was employed,
interfaced to the CFOUR program suite . The diagonal Born–Oppenheimer corrections
(DBOC) were carried out using CFOUR. All basis sets involved belong to the correlation
consistent family of Dunning and co-workers .
The notation aug’-cc-pV(n+d)Z
indicates the combination of regular cc-pVnZ on hydrogen and aug-cc-pV(n+d)Z on other
Weizmann-4 (W4) theory represents a layered extrapolation to the all-electron, relativistic
CCSDTQ5 inﬁnite basis set limit energy, and has been speciﬁed and rationalized in great
detail elsewhere . In short, the W4 computational protocol involves the following steps:
• The ROHF-SCF contribution is extrapolated from the aug’-cc-pV(5+d)Z and
aug’-cc-pV(6+d)Z basis sets using the Karton–Martin modiﬁcation of Jensen’s
extrapolation formula .
• The RCCSD valence correlation energy is calculated from these same basis sets.
Following the suggestion of Klopper , it is partitioned into singlet-coupled pair
energies, triplet-coupled pair energies, and ˆT1 terms. The singlet-coupled and tripletcoupled pair energies are extrapolated using the A + B/Lα two-point extrapolation
formula (where L is the highest angular momentum present in the basis set) with
αS=3 and αT=5, respectively, and the ˆT1 term (which exhibits very weak basis set
dependence) is set equal to that in the largest basis set.
• The (T) valence correlation energy is extrapolated from the aug’-cc-pV(Q+d)Z and
aug’-cc-pV(5+d)Z basis sets using the A+B/L3 two-point extrapolation formula. For
open-shell systems the Werner-Knowles-Hampel (a.k.a. MOLPRO) deﬁnition of
the restricted open-shell CCSD(T) energy is employed throughout, rather than the
original Watts-Gauss-Bartlett (a.k.a. ACES II/CFour) deﬁnition.
• The higher-order connected triples,
ˆT3−(T), valence correlation contribution is
extrapolated from the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets using the A+B/L3 two-point
extrapolation formula.
• The connected quadruples, ˆT4, is partitioned into the valence correlation ˆT4−(Q) and
(Q) contributions. Which are calculated with the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets,
respectively. In refs. we showed that scaling their sum by 1.10 oﬀers a very
reliable (as well as fairly cost-eﬀective) estimate of the basis set limit ˆT4 contribution.
• The connected quintuples, ˆT5, contribution converges very rapidly with the basis
set, as it primarily represents static rather than dynamic correlation .
ˆT5 contribution is calculated with the sp part of cc-pVDZ, this truncated basis set
being denoted cc-pVDZ(no d).
• The CCSD(T) inner-shell contribution is extrapolated from the aug’-cc-pwCVTZ
and aug’-cc-pwCVQZ core-valence basis sets using the A + B/L3 two-point
extrapolation formula.

calculations .
• Atomic and molecular ﬁrst-order spin-orbit coupling terms are taken from the
experimental ﬁne structure.
• Finally, the diagonal Born–Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) is calculated at the
ROHF/AVTZ level of theory.
For the largest systems considered in the present work, namely CH3C(=O)OH, CH3CH2OH
and CH3CH2F, some of the post-CCSD(T) calculations proved to be too taxing even for our
most powerful machines (8 core, Nehalem X5550 2.66 GHz, with 72 GB of RAM, and 4 TB
hard drive). Therefore, the hydrogen basis sets were truncated in the post-CCSD(T) steps
in the following cases:
• In the valence CCSDT calculations for acetic acid, ethanol, and ﬂuoroethane, d
functions were omitted from the cc-pVTZ basis set, the resulting truncated basis set
being denoted PVTZ(no d on H).
• In the valence CCSDTQ calculations for ethanol and ﬂuoroethane, p functions were
omitted from cc-pVDZ, the resulting truncated basis set being denoted PVDZ(no p
From our experience this truncation of the basis sets has little (or no) visible eﬀect on
the above post-CCSD(T) contributions . In addition, the ˆT4 contribution for acetic acid
is taken from W4lite theory, i.e., ˆT4 = CCSDT(Q)/cc-pVDZ −CCSDT/cc-pVDZ. This
approximation should be of little consequence as the %TAEe[(T)] diagnostic for this system
is just 2.0% (vide infra).
In section III D we compare the relative performance of diﬀerent DFT exchangecorrelation functionals in predicting the reaction energies in the W4-11 dataset.
exchange-correlation functionals employed include the following classes (numbered by the
rungs on Perdew’s ‘Jacob’s Ladder of DFT’ they belong to):
1. the local density approximation (LDA), speciﬁcally SVWN5 ;
2. the pure generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals, employing both
the local density and the reduced density gradient:
B97-D , BLYP ,
HCTH407 , and PBE ;
3. the meta-GGAs, additionally employing the kinetic energy density τ (which contains
similar information as the Laplacian of the density): M06-L , TPSS and τ-
4. functionals involving the occupied orbitals, speciﬁcally hybrid functionals (involving
HF-like exchange) subdivided into
(4a) the hybrid GGAs (which one might term ‘imperfect fourth-rung functionals’):
BH&HLYP , B3LYP , B3P86 , B3PW91 , X3LYP ,
B97-1 , and PBE0 .
We also consider the range-separated hybrid GGAs
ωB97 , and ωB97-X ;
(4b) the hybrid meta-GGAs: TPSSh , B1B95 , PW6B95 , τ-HCTHh ,
BMK , M06, M06-2X, and M06-HF .
5. employing also virtual orbital information, double-hybrid functionals (involving both
HF-like exchange and MP2-like correlation): B2-PLYP , ROB2-PLYP , mPW2-
PLYP , B2T-PLYP , B2K-PLYP , B2GP-PLYP , and DSD-BLYP .
For functionals on rungs 1–4, we used the aug’-pc-3+d basis set of Jensen , which is of
[6s5p4d2f1g] quality but optimized for Hartree-Fock and DFT. In contrast, for the double
hybrids, which exhibit slower basis set convergence owing to the MP2-like correlation term,
we use the aug’-pc-4 basis set. The notation aug’-pc-n indicates the combination of regular
pc-n on hydrogen and aug-pc-n on other elements. The ‘+d’ suﬃx indicate the addition
of high-exponent d functions on second-row elements (with exponents in an even-tempered
series with stride 2.5) .
Finally, we evaluate the performance of a representative set of contemporary empirical
and nonempirical compound thermochemistry methods. These include: (a) the Gaussiann methods G3B3 , G3(MP2)B3 , G4 , G4(MP2) , and G4(MP2)-6X ; (b)
Petersson’s CBS-QB3 method and its variant ROCBS-QB3 ; (c) the Wilson group
ccCA (correlation consistent composite approach) as well as its more recent variant
ccCA-PS3 ; and (d) Weizmann-1 (W1) as implemented in Gaussian 09. 
All the DFT and composite thermochemical calculations were carried out using Gaussian
09, except for the ccCA calculations which were carried out using MOLPRO 2010.1 and
automated in that program’s scripting language. While (a) and (b) all include empirical
correction terms and factors of some form, neither ccCA nor W1 include parameters derived
from experiment, although W1 does include two parameters derived from more rigorous
calculations.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this work, we add 41 small to medium sized species to the our W4-08 dataset of 99
total atomization energies for ﬁrst- and second-row species . The earlier W4-08 dataset
contains only a handful of non-hydrocarbon organic functionalities (mainly, a few amine
and imine species), therefore, in the present work we have added 28 organic compounds:
ﬂuoroalkanes (9), alcohols (4), carboxylic acids (2), aldehyde (1), dialdehyde (1), epoxides
(2), cyclic peroxide (1), ketene (1), imine (3), cyanates (2), nitroso (1), and hydrocarbon
(1). We have also added 9 inorganic compounds, most notably: hydrogen azide, cis/transnitrous acid, cis/trans-hydrotrioxy radical, tetraﬂuorosilane, and chloramine. Finally, we
add 4 hydrocarbon species (propane, propene, propyne and allene), W4 data on which
were previously reported in Ref. . The resulting dataset includes a total of 140 neutral
species: closed shell (106), radicals (27), and triplet systems (7). We note that of the closed
shell species, nine are singlet carbenes. The ﬁnal set includes: hydrogen-containing (84),
hydrogen-free (56), organic (59), and inorganic compounds (81), with single and multiple
bonds that involve varying degrees of covalent and ionic characters. This set evidently spans
the gamut from systems dominated by a single reference conﬁguration (such as H2O and
CH4) to systems dominated by nondynamical correlation (such as F2O2, O3, and BN 1Σ+).
In terms of elemental composition the dataset includes: ﬁrst-row species (99), second-row
species (19), mixed ﬁrst- and second-row species (21), and dihydrogen. Table I lists the set
of 140 molecules in the W4-11 dataset.
Multireference considerations
Table II provides the percentage of the total atomization energy accounted for by the
SCF, (T) triples, post-CCSD(T) (i.e., [ ˆT3−(T)+ ˆT4 + ˆT5]), and [ ˆT4 + ˆT5] contributions from
W4 theory (as well as the coupled cluster T1 and D1 diagnostics ) for the 37 systems
that were added to the W4-11 dataset in the present work. Diagnostics for the entire W4-
11 set are included as Supporting Information (Table SI-I). For thermochemical purposes,
the %TAEe[ ˆT4 + ˆT5], i.e., the percentage of the total atomization energy accounted for by
the connected quadruple and quintuple excitations, provides the best a posteriori measure
of nondynamical correlation eﬀects .
Table II presents the squared correlation
coeﬃcients (R2) between the %TAEe[ ˆT4+ ˆT5] metric and the other diagnostics over the whole
W4-11 dataset of 140 species. For the %TAEe[(T)] diagnostic we obtain the same R2 value
(0.94) that was obtained in ref. for a much smaller set of molecules, thus conﬁrming that
%TAEe[(T)] serves as a reliable diagnostic for the importance of nondynamical correlation.
We also note that the coupled cluster T1 and D1 diagnostics do not correlate well with the
%TAEe[ ˆT4 + ˆT5] metric (R2 = 0.38 and 0.33, respectively). In the context of the present
work, we note that %TAEe[(T)] values higher than 5% are obtained for ﬁve inorganic species:
cis-HON=O (5.3%), trans-HON=O (5.4%), HN3 (5.6%), cis-HO3· (7.4%), and trans-HO3·
(7.9%). All new systems are bound at the SCF level (%TAEe[(SCF)] = 24.0–53.3%, see
Table II).
The %TAEe percentages in Table II are relative to non-relativistic, valence CCSDTQ5
atomization energies from W4 theory. However, an a priori %TAEe[(T)]diagnostic, which
for all intents and purposes would give the same results , is given by:
%TAEe[(T)] = 100 × TAEe[CCSD(T)] −TAEe[CCSD]
TAEe[CCSD(T)]
where TAEe[CCSD] and TAEe[CCSD(T)] represent, respectively, valence CCSD and

atomization
Reference 
interpretation of the %TAEe[(T)] values:
below 2% indicates systems dominated by
dynamical correlation; 2–5% mild nondynamical correlation; 5–10% moderate nondynamical
correlation; and in excess of 10% severe nondynamical correlation.
It is of interest to examine the basis set dependence of the %TAEe[(T)] diagnostic (given
by eq. 1). Table III gives the error statistics (over the molecules in the W4-11 test set)
for the %TAEe[(T)] diagnostic calculated with the AVnZ (n = D, T, Q, and 5) basis sets
with respect to basis set limit values from W4 theory. It is evident that the %TAEe[(T)]
diagnostic exhibits a relatively weak basis set dependence, e.g., RMSD of 0.78% (AVDZ),
0.15% (AVTZ), 0.08% (AVQZ), and 0.06% (AV5Z) are obtained with respect to the basis
set limit values from W4 theory. Thus, it seems that values obtained with the AVTZ basis
set are suﬃciently converged for practical purposes, and even the AVDZ values are generally
within 1% of the basis set limit values (for pathologically multireference cases such as FOO
and FOOF the deviation may reach up to 2%).
Validation of Wn theories
Table IV lists the component breakdown of the ﬁnal W4 total atomization energies at the
bottom of the well (TAEe) for the 37 new species considered in the present work. The W4
(or higher) components for the entire W4-11 set are given as Supporting Information (Table
SI-II). It is worth noting that for most systems higher-order triple excitations, ˆT3−(T), and
the post-CCSDT excitations, ˆT4 + ˆT5, tend to largely cancel one another (they are of similar
orders of magnitude, but ˆT4 + ˆT5 universally increase the atomization energy while ˆT3−(T)
generally decrease it). However, for the ﬁve species with %TAEe[(T)]≥5% (vide supra) as
well as for SiF4 the sum of the post-CCSD(T) contributions amounts (in absolute value)
to more than half a kcal/mol: cis-HON=O (+0.66), trans-HON=O (+0.75), HN3 (+0.76),
cis-HO3 (+1.85), trans-HO3 (+2.31), and SiF4 (−0.67 kcal/mol).
A comparison between the ﬁnal W4 values at 0 K (TAE0) and the Active Thermochemical
Tables data for the 37 systems added in the present work is given in Table V, whereas
a comparison for the entire W4-11 set is given as Supporting Information (Table SI-III).
Experimental atomization energies from ATcT with associated 95% conﬁdence intervals
equal to (or narrower than) 0.05 kcal/mol are available in the literature for 36 species. Of these, an unusually large discrepancy between the W4 and ATcT (of
0.50 kcal/mol) is found for hydrazine. This discrepancy is unexpected since this system does
not exhibit strong nondynamical correlation eﬀects (%TAEe[(T)] = 1.9%, ˆT4 = 0.43, and ˆT5
= 0.02 kcal/mol) and the uncertainty in our ZPVE can only account for a fraction of this gap.
Klopper and coworkers, both using Gaussian basis sets and using explicitly correlated
methods , found results similar to our own for this molecule, which suggests the ATcT
value might be reconsidered.
For the rest of the 35 highly accurate ATcT atomization
energies there is excellent agreement between W4 and experiment (ATcT). W4 theory attains
an RMSD of 0.085 kcal/mol and a MAD of 0.065 kcal/mol (implying a 95% conﬁdence
interval of about 0.17 kcal/mol). A MSD of −0.011 kcal/mol suggests that W4 theory is
free of systematic bias. These error statistics are identical to those obtained in the original
W4 paper for a dataset of about half the size (RMSD = 0.085, MAD = 0.066, and
MSD = −0.011). Forty ﬁve ATcT atomization energies are associated with 95% conﬁdence
intervals ≤0.10 kcal/mol.
For this extended evaluation test set W4 theory aﬀords an
RMSD of 0.102, a MAD of 0.080, and a MSD of −0.008 kcal/mol.
We note, however,
that for all these systems the discrepancy between W4 and experiment is still below the
threshold of “benchmark accuracy” (arbitrarily deﬁned as 1 kJ/mol = 0.24 kcal/mol). In
particular, the largest deviations (theory−experiment) being: −0.23 (ozone), −0.21 (formic
acid), +0.20 (trans-nitrous acid and cis-nitrous acid), and +0.22 kcal/mol (propane). Ozone
represents an extremely challenging system for single reference methods due to its notoriously
multireference character (e.g., %TAEe[(T)] = 17.4%).
Including a ˆT3−(T) correction to
the core-valence contribution computed with the cc-pwCVTZ basis set (i.e., W4.2 theory)
narrows the gap between theory and experiment for ozone by 0.10 kcal/mol. Additional
upgrading of the basis sets in the valence post-CCSD(T) steps (in W4.3 theory) further
increases the TAE0 by a very small amount of 0.02 kcal/mol , and in addition W4.3
includes a ˆT6 contribution of 0.05 kcal/mol. Thus, the discrepancy between W4.3 and ATcT
is reduced to merely 0.07 kcal/mol. However, the other four systems with large discrepancies
(formic acid, trans/cis-nitrous acid, and propane) are characterized by mild to moderate
nondynamical correlation eﬀects (e.g., %TAEe[(T)] = 1.0–5.4%). The lion’s share of the
discrepancy between theory and experiment can, by default, be attributed to deﬁciencies in
the theoretical ZPVE.
What about the reduced-cost members of the Wn family? Estimating the post-CCSD(T)
corrections from a computationally relatively inexpensive CCSDT(Q)/PVDZ calculation, as
is done in the W4lite protocol, results in RMSD = 0.125 and MAD = 0.093 kcal/mol over
the set of 35 highly accurate ATcT values. (We note that the (Q) step, which dominates the
cost, parallelizes exceedingly well.) Again, these statistics are in close agreement with the
error statistics obtained in ref. (RMSD = 0.12 and MAD = 0.09 kcal/mol). Additionally,
downgrading the basis sets used for the SCF, CCSD, and (T) extrapolations (i.e., the W3.2
protocol) results in another deterioration in the error statistics, namely, RMSD = 0.192 and
MAD = 0.143 kcal/mol (the corresponding values from ref. are 0.16 and 0.12 kcal/mol,
respectively).
Removing the post-CCSD(T) contributions from W3.2 theory altogether
(i.e., W2.2 theory) signiﬁcantly degrades performance (RMSD = 0.743 and MAD = 0.414
kcal/mol); note also that the atomization energies are now on average underestimated — as
indicated by an MSD of −0.368 kcal/mol — as well as that MAD/RMSD is far removed from
the idealized ≈4/5 value. However, it should be mentioned that omitting the ten systems for
which %TAEe[(T)] ≥5% from the evaluation set reduces the W2.2 error statistics to: RMSD
= 0.251, MAD = 0.182, and MSD = −0.118 kcal/mol. Thus, for systems dominated by mild
nondynamical correlation eﬀects (i.e., for which %TAEe[(T)] ≤5%) W2.2 theory (like the
original W2 ) aﬀords a respectable 95% conﬁdence interval of about half a kcal/mol.
(This illustrates, by the way, the usefulness of the MAD/RMSD ratio as a convenient probe
for outliers.)
The above error statistics imply 95% conﬁdence intervals for the Wn methods of about
1.49 (W2.2), 0.38 (W3.2), 0.25 (W4lite), and 0.17 kcal/mol (W4). Figure 1 shows the normal
distribution functions for the errors between the theoretical and experimental atomization
It illustrates that, in order to consistently obtain atomization energies with
benchmark (or better) accuracy, post-CCSD(T) contributions of at least up to CCSDT(Q)
must be included. In a recent publication, we have shown that post-CCSD(T) correlation
eﬀects, in particular, connected quadruple excitations, are essential for obtaining re and ωe
with RMSD from experiment of 0.0005 ˚A and 2 cm−1, respectively .
The W4-11 dataset and subsets thereof
Table SI-IV of the Supporting Information contains the ﬁnal 140 atomization energies of
the entire W4-11 dataset calculated at the W4 (or higher) level (this set is denoted TAE140).
Two values are listed: (a) zero-point exclusive, non-relativistic, clamped-nuclei TAEs for
validation/parametrization of DFT functionals, and (b) zero-point inclusive, relativistic
TAEs with DBOC for comparison with experiment.
For the purpose of testing and/or parametrizing DFT functionals, the TAE140 test set
can be divided into two subsets:
(a) A non-multireference (TAE nonMR124) subset of 124 systems,
for which the
%TAEe[(T)] diagnostic is below 10%
(b) A multireference (TAE MR16) subset of 16 systems, for which the %TAEe[(T)]
diagnostic is in excess of 10%, namely, Be2, B2, C2(1Σ+), BN(1Σ+), OF, F2O, FOO,
FOOF, Cl2O, ClOO, OClO, O3, S3, and S4 (note that cis/trans-HO3 for which
%TAEe[(T)] = 7.4 and 7.9, respectively, are also included in this subset).
These two subsets are given in Table SI-V of the Supporting Information. In the following
Section, we compare the relative performance of diﬀerent DFT exchange-correlation
functionals in predicting the atomization reaction energies.
The TAE140 test set of 140 atomization reactions proves to be very challenging for
DFT functionals (in particular the TAE MR14 subset is extremely taxing), and thus serves
as a critical test case for any DFT method.
However, we acknowledge that DFT and
composite thermochemical procedures are often used for computing energies of reactions
that are less demanding from the electronic structure point of view (e.g., isomerization and
bond dissociation reactions) due to a larger degree of systematic error cancelation between
reactants and products . We therefore introduce four additional reaction subsets to the
W4-11 database: 99 bond dissociation (BDE99), 707 heavy-atom transfer (HAT707), 20
isomerization (ISOMER20), and 13 nucleophilic substitution reactions (SN13). The W4 (or
higher) reference reaction energies for these four subsets are depicted in Tables SI-VI–SI-IX
of the Supporting Information. Figure 2 shows the reaction energy distribution of the ﬁve
subsets of the W4-11 database. The reactions in the HAT707 subset are distributed over
a symmetric range from −242.7 to +242.6 kcal/mol in a smooth sigmoid fashion. All the
reaction energies in the other subsets are positive and span the following ranges: 2.7–1007.9
(TAE140), 5.3–237.1 (BDE99), 0.2–132.2 (ISOMER20), and 2.5–48.1 kcal/mol (SN13).
Performance of density functional theory and composite thermochemical
procedures for the W4-11 database
In the present section, we evaluate the performance of a selected set of 31 DFT
exchange-correlation functionals and 7 empirical composite thermochemical procedures and
5 nonempirical thermochemical procedures for the ﬁve subsets in the W4-11 database
(TAE140, BDE99, HAT707, ISOMER20, and SN13).
We point out, however, that the
Supporting Information includes a perl script that will automatically generate the error
statistics for any given procedure with a push of a button, in addition to the required
Gaussian input ﬁles.
To ensure we are “comparing apples to apples”, so to speak, the reference W4-11 data
employed here are the clamped-nuclei, nonrelativistic, zero-point exclusive values.
consistency, data from composite thermochemistry schemes considered were brought on the
same footing. The CCSD(T)/cc-pV(Q+d)Z reference geometries and the reference reaction
energies are given as Supporting Information. The root mean square deviations (RMSD),
mean signed deviations (MSD), and mean average deviations (MAD) for the subsets of
reactions in the W4-11 database are gathered in Tables VI–X.
(The dispute as to which error measure, RMSD or MAD, is the superior one is nearly
as old as modern statistics: Huber’s textbook on robust statistics quotes Eddington as
favoring the more robust MAD , and Fisher as favoring RMSD which has an intuitive
relationship to measurement error . The MAD/RMSD ratio for a purely Gaussian error
distribution with no systematic error was found by Geary to be
2/π ≈0.7979 ≈4
fact, he proposed the equivalent d/σ ratio as a measure for kurtosis, with values below
2/π indicating a leptokurtic (peaked, long tail) distribution, and values above
that is platykurtic (ﬂattened, short tail). For a general distribution, a didactic article 
shows that the MAD/RMSD ratio for N observation is bounded from below by
for a single nonzero error, and by 1 (unity) for homogenous errors ±E. For a Gaussian
distribution with random error σ and systematic error a, the present authors ﬁnd that
2x2) + x erf( x
where x ≡a
σ. It is easily seen that in the limit for small x, this ratio approaches
in the limit for large x, it approaches unity. Note that even for a = σ, the ratio only reaches
0.82493, so
2/π or 4/5 is still a good rule of thumb. Ratios well below that, in the present
context, typically indicate one or more large outliers.)
Performance of the various functionals for the 140 atomization reactions are summarized
in Table VI. Beginning with the subset of 124 non-multireference systems (for which the
%TAEe[(T)] < 10%, TAE nonMR124). Not surprisingly, LDA overbinds strongly. The only
GGA or meta-GGA that has an RMSD below 5 kcal/mol are B97-D and τ-HCTH (at 4.3 and
4.7 kcal/mol, respectively), which is followed by M06-L (5.3 kcal/mol); PBE’s conspicuously
high RMSD (16.9 kcal/mol) is largely due to systematic overbinding. Among conventional
hybrid GGAs and meta-GGAs, PW6B95 emerges as the best performer with RMSD=2.5
kcal/mol. While it (like B1B95) is technically a meta-GGA in the correlation functional
owing to the kinetic energy density-dependent factor that suppresses self-correlation, it is a
simple GGA otherwise. The fact that it, with a mere six empirical parameters, manages to
outperform vastly more complex hybrid meta-GGAs like M06 and M06-2X is intriguing. For
the W4-11 dataset, PW6B95 represents a signiﬁcant, but not spectacular, improvement over
the related B1B95 functional; both are trailed at some distance by the hybrid GGAs B3PW91
(3.7), PBE0 (4.1), and B3LYP (4.3 kcal/mol). ”True” hybrid meta-GGAs considered (except
for M06-HF and TPSSh) exhibit RMSDs ranging between 2.8–3.9 kcal/mol, with BMK and
M06-2X emerging as the best performers. (We also note in passing that, among ’pure’ hybrid
GGAs, B3PW91 appears to edge out the others, including B3LYP.) The range-separated
hybrid ωB97-X slightly bests PW6B95 at 2.4 kcal/mol — and also outperforms it for the
DBH24 set of barrier heights — while ωB97, which has no Hartree-Fock exchange in the
short-range part, still achieves a respectable 3.1 kcal/mol. Finally, the double hybrids, as a
group, show the best overall performance with RMSDs varying between 1.8–2.7 kcal/mol. In
particular, ROB2-PLYP and B2GP-PLYP yield RMSD below 2.0 kcal/mol. If performance
for reaction barrier heights is also a consideration, then DSD-BLYP, B2GP-PLYP, and
ROB2-PLYP have the edge over the others.
The composite wavefunction-based thermochemical procedures (G3B3, G3(MP2)B3,
G4, G4(MP2), CBS-QB3, and ROCBS-QB3) perform rather well with RMSDs of 1.8–2.0
kcal/mol. However, the recently developed G4(MP2)-6X procedure performs exceptionally
well with an RMSD of only 1.1 kcal/mol. The nonempirical W1-type procedures attain
sub-kcal/mol RMSDs of 0.57–0.69 kcal/mol (with W1U, surprisingly, performing marginally
better than W1Usc and W1RO), while ccCA and ccCA-PS3 procedures aﬀord RMSDs of 1.08
and 1.03 kcal/mol, respectively. We do note that ccCA and ccCA-PS3 are computationally
more aﬀordable than the W1 procedures, as their basis set extrapolation steps take place at
the MP2 rather than the CCSD or CCSD(T) level; in addition, a resolution of the identity
(RI-MP2) approximation can be applied to said MP2 steps , further reducing CPU
time and (drastically so) disk space requirements, and leaving CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z
as the most time-consuming step.
ccCA may be seen as intermediate, in quality and
computational cost, between W1 and the Gn family, but devoid of the latter’s empiricism.
Note that the MAD/RMSD ratio for ccCA is considerably less than the value for a normal
distribution, and detailed inspection indeed reveals errors of 2.5–5 kcal/mol for several
molecules (AlCl3, AlF3, S2O, SO2, SiF4, and SO3, in increasing order of error), all of which
have second-row atoms in high oxidation states. As discussed at length in Ref. , in such
molecules the second-row 3d orbital is low enough in energy that it will accept back-bonding
from O and F lone pairs, making the 3d an ‘honorary valence orbital’, and a good description
of its high-exponent region is imperative. W1 theory adds two tight d functions and a tight
f function to every 2nd-row atom in all basis set extrapolation steps, while W2, W3, and
W4 go out to mich larger basis sets to begin with.
Inclusion of the 16 highly multireference systems (with %TAEe[(T)] > 10%) has a
pronounced eﬀect on the error statistics of some of the functionals, particularly those that
involve a high fraction of exact exchange. Speciﬁcally, upon inclusion of the 16 systems the
RMSDs are increased by as much as 4.1 (M06-HF), 3.1 (BH&HLYP), 2.9 (ωB97), 2.7 (ωB97-
X), 2.0 (BMK), and 1.9 kcal/mol (M06-2X). At the other extreme, the RMSDs of M06L,
TPSSh, M06, DSD-BLYP, and B2-PLYP are increased by only 0.1–0.5 kcal/mol. Again, the
double hybrids emerge as the best performers for the entire set of 140 atomization energies
(TAE140). Among them, B2-PLYP and DSD-BLYP are the most resilient toward strong
nondynamical correlation: if performance on barrier heights is also a consideration, then
DSD-BLYP emerges as the winner. Finally, we note that the performance statistics of the
empirical composite ab initio procedures are not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the inclusion of the
16 highly multireference systems. As expected, the performance of the nonempirical W1type procedures (that do not account for explicit or implicit post-CCSD(T) contributions)
deteriorates upon inclusion of the highly multireference systems, namely, the RMSD are:
0.9 (W1U), 1.1 (W1Usc), and 0.9 kcal/mol (W1RO).
Table VII gives the error statistics over the BDE99 subset of 99 bond dissociation
reactions.
The GGAs and meta-GGAs show relatively poor performance with RMSDs
varying between 4.7 (B97-D) and 10.0 kcal/mol (PBE). The hybrid GGAs (except for
BH&HLYP) attain RMSDs between 3.2–5.4 kcal/mol, where B97-1 (and, to a lesser extent,
PW6B95) perform signiﬁcantly better than the rest. The hybrid meta-GGAs (other than
M06-HF) show similar performance for BDE99: RMSDs vary between 3.7–5.1 kcal/mol,
with M06 putting in the best performance.
Overall, the double hybrids give the best
performance with RMSDs varying between 2.5–3.3 kcal/mol (excluding B2K-PLYP, which
was parametrized for thermochemical kinetics and attains an RMSD of 4.1 kcal/mol). In
particular, we note the good performance of ROB2-PLYP and B2-PLYP with an RMSD of
2.5 kcal/mol. The empirical composite ab initio procedures yield RMSDs ranging between
1.0–1.9 kcal/mol, where G4 and G4(MP2) oﬀer up the best performance with RMSDs
of 1.0 and 1.1 kcal/mol, respectively.
Of the W1-type procedures, W1RO (RMSD =
0.8 kcal/mol) performs signiﬁcantly better than W1U and W1Usc (RMSD = 1.2 and 1.4
kcal/mol, respectively). The ccCA and ccCA-PS3 methods exhibit similar performance as
W1RO, with an RMSD of 0.8 kcal/mol.
The error statistics for the HAT707 subset of 707 heavy-atom transfer reaction energies
are summarized in Table VIII. The RMSDs for the GGAs and meta-GGAs vary between
5.3 (M06-L) and 8.0 kcal/mol (PBE). The hybrid GGAs (excluding BH&HLYP) perform
acceptably well with RMSDs ranging between 3.6–5.1 kcal/mol, PW6B95 displaying the
best performance, closely followed by B97-1. Similarly, the hybrid meta-GGAs (excluding
M06-HF) attain RMSDs varying between 3.9–5.5 kcal/mol, B1B95 performing the best.
All the double hybrids show very good performance with RMSDs varying between 2.3–3.1
kcal/mol (aside from B2K-PLYP which gives an RMSD of 4.1 kcal/mol). Of the empirical
composite thermochemical procedures, G4 gives the best performance with a RMSD of 1.2
kcal/mol, while ccCA, ccCA-PS3, and W1RO emerge as the best nonempirical procedures
with RMSDs of 1.0–1.3 kcal/mol.
Figure 3 shows the RMSDs of the exchange-correlation functionals and composite
thermochemical procedures over the TAE140, BDE99, and HAT707 subsets of the W4-11
Turning our attention to the much smaller ISOMER20 subset of 20 isomerization reactions
present in the W4-11 dataset (Table IX), we note that almost all of the functionals considered
perform well. Most notably, all of the considered hybrid GGAs (except for BH&HLYP),
hybrid meta-GGAs (excluding M06-HF and TPSSh), and double hybrids (excluding B2K-
PLYP) give RMSDs between 2.0–3.0 kcal/mol. In particular, we note that M06-2X gives
an RMSD of only 1.5 kcal/mol for this subset. As expected, the composite thermochemical
procedures perform especially well for the isomerization energies, with RMSD below the
“chemical accuracy” threshold of 1 kcal/mol. Most notably, G3B3, G3(MP2)B3, CBS-QB3,
ROCBS-QB3, ccCA, and ccCA-PS3 attain RMSDs between 0.3–0.5 kcal/mol, whereas the
W1-type procedures attain RMSDs of 0.2 kcal/mol.
Likewise, for the SN13 subset of 13 nucleophilic substitution reactions present in the
W4-11 dataset (Table X), nearly all of the functionals show excellent performance.
particular, the GGA (M06-L), the hybrid GGAs (ωB97-X, ωB97, PBE0, and B3PW91), the
hybrid meta-GGAs (BMK, M06-2X, and B1B95) attain RMSDs of 1.0–1.4 kcal/mol. The
double hybrids (excluding B2-PLYP) attain RMSDs lower than 1.0 kcal/mol, most notably:
B2K-PLYP (0.4), B2GP-PLYP (0.7), and ROB2-PLYP (0.7 kcal/mol). The same is true for
the composite thermochemical procedures, where the CBS-QB3, ROCBS-QB3, ccCA-type,
and W1-type procedures all attain RMSDs of 0.3 kcal/mol.
CONCLUSIONS
This work provides an extension to the W4-08 dataset to be known as the W4-11 dataset.
The W4-11 dataset is aimed for testing/parametrizing approximate electronic structure
methods such as DFT functionals. The W4-11 dataset includes a total of 140 highly accurate
atomization energies obtained by means of the W4 (or higher) thermochemical protocol. Of
these 140 atomization energies, 35 highly accurate experimental values (with associated
uncertainty of ±0.05 kcal/mol, or narrower) are available from ATcT. Against these 35 data
points W4 theory aﬀords a root mean square deviation of 0.085 kcal/mol, a mean absolute
deviation of 0.065 kcal/mol (implying a 95% conﬁdence interval of about 0.17 kcal/mol). For
the lower-cost members of the Wn family, the following RMSDs (and 95% conﬁdence interval
in parentheses) are obtained: 0.13 (0.25) W4lite, 0.19 (0.38) W3.2, and 0.74 (1.49 kcal/mol)
W2.2. We note that the RMSD for W2.2 theory drops to 0.25 kcal/mol (implying a 95%
conﬁdence interval of about 0.50 kcal/mol) after eliminating the ten systems dominated by
moderate or severe nondynamical correlation eﬀects (i.e., with %TAEe[(T)] diagnostic ≥
5%) from the evaluation set. The MAD/RMSD ratio, which is nearly the idealized ≈4/5
value for W4 but considerably lower for W2.2, likewise indicates outlier issues with W2.2.
A plethora of energetic data can be generated from the 140 atomizations energies in the
W4-11 dataset. In particular, the following subsets of reactions are introduced: 99 bond
dissociation (BDE99), 707 heavy-atom transfer (HAT707), 20 isomerization (ISOMER20),
and 13 nucleophilic substitution reactions (SN13).
Finally, the performance of 30 commonly used DFT functionals over the subsets in the
W4-11 database is evaluated. The following general observations are oﬀered: (a) the GGA
and meta-GGAs show poorer performance than the hybrid and double-hybrid functionals,
with B97-D and M06L putting in the best performances; (b) among hybrid GGAs and
meta-GGAs, PW6B95 is the best performer, followed by M06-2X, BMK, and B1B95, with
PW6B95 and B1B95 being more resilient toward nondynamical correlation than the two
others, and M06-2X oﬀering superlative performance for barrier heights; (c) range-separated
hybrid GGAs outperform both conventional hybrid GGAs and ditto meta-GGAs, but appear
to be hypersensitive toward nondynamical correlation; (d) among double hybrids, B2GP-
PLYP, ROB2-PLYP and DSD-BLYP all perform at accuracies comparable to composite ab
initio methods like G3 theory. The spin-component scaled double hybrid DSD-BLYP has
an edge over the other functionals in terms of resilience toward nondynamical correlation;
(e) among the composite ab initio thermochemistry methods, only W1 theory breaks the 1
kcal/mol barrier for RMSD values, but the very recent G4(MP2)-6X method of Radom and
coworkers oﬀers a stellar price-performance ratio.

 For highly multireference systems, such as O3, FO·, FOO·, F2O2, and ClOO· the diﬀerences
range between 0.2−0.4%. An extreme case for which this assumption clearly does not hold is
the beryllium diatomic. The contributions to the atomization energy from W4.3 theory are:
−6.79 (SCF), 6.04 (CCSD), 2.61 ((T)), 0.41 ( ˆT3−(T)), 0.24 ( ˆT4), and 0.00 kcal/mol ( ˆT5).
Therefore, Be2 is unbound both at the SCF and CCSD levels and we obtain an artiﬁcially
high %TAEe[(T)] values of 104.5% with respect to the CCSDTQ5 TAE, and %TAEe[(T)] =
140.6% with respect to the CCSD(T) TAE.
