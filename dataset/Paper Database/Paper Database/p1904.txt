Background: Cardiotocography (CTG) is a monitoring of fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. Since 1960 it is
routinely used by obstetricians to assess fetal well-being. Many attempts to introduce methods of automatic signal
processing and evaluation have appeared during the last 20 years, however still no significant progress similar to that
in the domain of adult heart rate variability, where open access databases are available (e.g. MIT-BIH), is visible. Based
on a thorough review of the relevant publications, presented in this paper, the shortcomings of the current state are
obvious. A lack of common ground for clinicians and technicians in the field hinders clinically usable progress. Our
open access database of digital intrapartum cardiotocographic recordings aims to change that.
Description: The intrapartum CTG database consists in total of 552 intrapartum recordings, which were acquired
between April 2010 and August 2012 at the obstetrics ward of the University Hospital in Brno, Czech Republic. All
recordings were stored in electronic form in the OB TraceVue®system. The recordings were selected from 9164
intrapartum recordings with clinical as well as technical considerations in mind. All recordings are at most 90 minutes
long and start a maximum of 90 minutes before delivery. The time relation of CTG to delivery is known as well as the
length of the second stage of labor which does not exceed 30 minutes. The majority of recordings (all but 46 cesarean
sections) is – on purpose – from vaginal deliveries. All recordings have available biochemical markers as well as some
more general clinical features. Full description of the database and reasoning behind selection of the parameters is
presented in the paper.
Conclusion: A new open-access CTG database is introduced which should give the research community common
ground for comparison of results on reasonably large database. We anticipate that after reading the paper, the reader
will understand the context of the field from clinical and technical perspectives which will enable him/her to use the
database and also understand its limitations.

Background
Introduction
Fetal heart activity is the prominent source of information
about fetal well being during delivery. Cardiotocography
(CTG) – recording of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine
contractions – enables obstetricians to detect fetus with
deteriorating status (e.g. ongoing fetal hypoxia), which
may occur even in a previously uncomplicated pregnancy.
Even though fetus has its own natural defense mechanism
to tackle the oxygen insufficiency during the delivery, in
some cases only timely intervention can prevent adverse

consequences. Hypoxia, with prevalence lying in the
region of 0.6% to 3.5% , is considered to be the third
most common cause of newborn death .
Cardiotocography was introduced in late 1960s and is
still the most prevalent method of intrapartum hypoxia
detection. It did not, however, bring the expected
improvements in the delivery outcomes in comparison to
previously used intermittent auscultation . Moreover,
continuous CTG is the main suspect for growing percentage of cesarean sections (CS) for objective reasons, which
increased in the last decade .
To tackle the problems of CTG three principal approaches were followed during the years. The first approach
focused on improving low inter and intra-observer agreement . In 1986 International Federation of Gynecology
and Obstetrics (FIGO) introduced general guidelines

based on evaluation of macroscopic morphological FHR
features and their relation to the tocographic measurement. But even though the guidelines are available for
almost thirty years now, poor interpretation of CTG still
persists . Many tweaks to the guidelines were proposed during the years, but with no significant change to
the inter-observer variability. For overview of the different
guidelines we refer the reader to .
The second approach to improve the overall results of
CTG looks for technical solutions to add more objective/quantitative evaluation of the state of the fetus using
additional measurement techniques. Some used techniques are regionally/country limited in their use – such
as fetal blood sampling or fetal pulse oxymetry
 . The only widespread method is evaluation of averaged repolarization behavior of fetal ECG performed by
STAN. Many studies were published comparing STANenhanced CTG with use of CTG only. The majority of
studies proved that the addition of STAN indeed leads to
slightly better fetal outcomes but problems were
also reported .
Attempts to computer evaluation of the CTG – the third
approach – started almost immediately after introduction of the first unified FIGO guidelines. FIGO features
became fundamental in most of the first clinically oriented
approaches and automatically extracted morphological
features played the major role in all automatic systems for
CTG analysis .
We suggest interested reader to refer to e.g. for
more details on CTG preprocessing and to e.g. for
more details on different features that had been extracted
to characterize the FHR since the focus of this paper is
rather on the database presentation.
When reviewing literature on automatic CTG processing, two things are striking. First, there is a large disconnection between approaches and goals in the clinical
and technical papers. The clinical papers are mostly
looking for applicable solutions to the clinically pressing
issues (lack of agreement, critically misclassified recordings). The technical papers often use CTG data as just
an another input to the carefully tuned classifiers. Most
works use very small ad-hoc acquired datasets, differently
sampled with various parameters used as outcome measures, though we have to concede that our previous works
 were done exactly in the same manner. It is hard
to believe that it is more than 30 years when computer
processing of CTG has begun and since then, no common database of CTG records is availablea. There is no
way how to compare/improve/disregard among different
results. And that, in our opinion, hinders any significant
progress towards the ultimate goal of a usable and working
automated classification of the CTG recordings.
In this paper we present a novel open-access CTG
database, which we will call further in the paper CTU-
UHB databaseb. It consists of CTG records and clinical
information. We first provide a comprehensive overview
of databases used in literature in the last years. Then we
describe development of the CTU-UHB database. We discuss the criteria for selection of records for the database
from clinical and technical point of view. At last, we
present a detailed description of main clinical and technical parameters, which, in our opinion, are important
for understanding and should be taken into account when
using the database.
Overview of CTG databases used in literature
We performed a systematic search in the electronic
database PUBMED including records up to February
2013. The language of studies was restricted to English.
The various combination of the following keywords were
used: cardiotocography, fetal heart rate, fetal heart rate
monitoring, computer assisted diagnosis, fetal distress,
asphyxia, hypoxemia, fetal hypoxia. In the selected articles the references were searched and articles that cited
the paper were searched as well.
It is impossible to provide exhaustive review and, therefore, several inclusion criteria were applied to include
all relevant works but keep the overview as clear as
possible. First, if a CTG database was used in multiple works, we included the paper where the database
was described in most detail. If the description was
the same, we included the most recent paper, e.g. we
preferred paper of Jezewski et al. rather than of
Czabanski et al. . Second, only those works that used
intrapartum CTG signals were considered, e.g. we did
not include the work of H. Ocak since he worked
with UCI Cardiotocography Data Setc. Third, we preferred journal papers and works that attempted to show
results with regards to objective annotation (pH, base
excess, etc.).
Our search of CTG databases used in other studies
(with applied selection criteria) resulted in inclusion of 22
works. Due to the space limitation the overview had to
be split into two tables, Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 presents
used databases regarding the CTG signals and clinical parameters, namely: type of acquisition (ultrasound
Doppler (US), direct fetal electrocardiogram measurement (FECG)); antepartum (ante.) or intrapartum (inte.)
phase; stage of labor (I. or II.); length of FHR signal; time to
actual delivery; use of uterine contractions (UC), description of inclusion criteria; description of clinical data;
evaluation type: objective (obj.), subjective (subj.), or combination of both (comb.); number of total cases. The number of cases varies from study to study, the lowest being
around 50 cases, and the highest being 7568 cases. Table 2
presents the overview of databases from classification
point of view. It is apparent that in each paper different
criteria for classes division were used, thus, making any

Construction and content
Ethics statement
The CTG recordings and clinical data were matched by
anonymized unique identifier generated by the hospital
information system. The timings of CTG records were
matched to stages of labor (first and second stage) and
were made relative to the time of birth, thus also deidentified. This study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of University Hospital Brno; all women
signed informed consent.
Data collection
The data were collected between 27th of April 2010 and
6th of August 2012 at the obstetrics ward of the University
Hospital in Brno (UHB), Czech Republic. The data consisted of two main components, the first were intrapartum
CTG recordings and the second were clinical data.
The CTGs were recorded using STAN S21 and S31
(Neoventa Medical, Mölndal, Sweden) and Avalon FM40
and FM50 (Philips Healthcare, Andover, MA) fetal monitors. All CTG signals were stored in an electronic form
in the OB TraceVue®system (Philips) in a proprietary format and converted into text format using proprietary
software provided by Philips. Each CTG record contains time information and signal of fetal heart rate and
uterine contractions both sampled at 4 Hz. When a signal was recorded using internal scalp electrode it also
contained T/QRS ratio and information about biphasic T-wave. From 9164 intrapartum recordings the final
database of 552 carefully selected CTGs was created keeping in consideration clinical as well as technical point of

view; the details about recordings selection are provided
The clinical data were stored in the hospital information system (AMIS) in the relational database. Complete
clinical information regarding delivery and fetal/maternal
information were obtained. The clinical data included:
delivery descriptors (presentation of fetus, type of delivery and length of the first and second stage), neonatal
outcome (seizures, intubation, etc.), fetal and neonatal
descriptors (sex, gestational week, weight, etc.), and information about mother and possible risk factors. For the
final CTU-UHB database, clinical data were exported
from relational database and converted into Physionet text
Data selection and criteria considered
The selection procedure of the records was based on both
clinical and CTG signal parameters and the process is
shown in Figure 1.
Clinical criteria
In the following paragraphs we describe criteria that were
used for records exclusion. Additionally we discuss shortly
the criteria that were included in the description of the
final database but were not used for records exclusion.
Clinical selection criteria The following parameters
were taken into account for inclusion of recordings into
the final database. References in this section refer to a
description of particular parameter.
• Women’s Age – although the women’s high age plays
significant role in the probability of congenital
diseases, for the intrapartum period no significance
was found . Low age (maternal age < 18 years)
could have an adverse effect and such records
were therefore excluded.
• Week of gestation – maturity of the fetus plays
significant role in the shape and behavior of the FHR
antepartum as well as intrapartum . Therefore
the selection was limited to mature fetuses
(weeks of gestation ≥37) according to the last
menses counting, which was in majority cases
confirmed by ultrasound measurement during
antepartum check-ups.
• Known fetal diseases – fetuses with known congenital
defects or known intrauterine growth restriction
(IUGR) that could influence the FHR and/or
outcome of the delivery were excluded from the
database. Additionally, postnatally detected defects
were consulted and two cases with transposed large
veins were left in the set, since these two particular
changes should not have influenced the FHR.
• Type of gravidity – only singleton, uncomplicated
pregnancies were included.
• Type of delivery – the majority of the database
consists of vaginal deliveries. Nevertheless to increase
the number of cases with pathological outcome in the
database, 16 CS recordings with pH ≤7.05 were
included and consequently a control group consisting
of 30 CS with normal outcomes was also included to
enable separate evaluation if necessary.
Additional clinical criteria provided Together with criteria used for selection, the following criteria were considered and are available together with the CTG data:
• Sex of the fetus – both sexes were included even
though the sex of fetus significantly influences the
outcome according to Bernardes et al. .
• Parity – although the first delivery can be “more
difficult” in general clinical sense it is the same
from the point of view of the FHR recording.
• Risk factors – to be able to describe and identify the a
priori high-risk pregnancies. We have included risk
factors that could have influenced the state of the
baby before entering the labor. For full review of the
parameters and further references we recommend
paper of Badawi et al. . The final risk factors
included in the database were gestational diabetes,
preeclampsia, maternal fever (>37.5°C), hypertension
and meconium stained fluid.
• Drugs – especially those administered during delivery
were considered only with regard to their influence
on FHR. Opiates may influence the FHR directly but
are rarely used in the Czech Republic during delivery
and were not used in any of the cases included in the
database. Therefore, we do not provide information
about drugs administration in the database. Note that
e.g. oxytocin used for enhancement of the uterine
activity influences the FHR in majority indirectly, via
increase of uterine activity, and thus can be assessed
from the CTG alone.
• Other criteria – complementary information in order
to offer insight why e.g. operative delivery was
chosen. These include: induced delivery, type of
presentation (occipital/breech), no progress of labor,
dystocia cephalocorporal (incoordinate uterine
activity), dystocia cephalopelvic.
Labor outcome measures
Since our main intention was to prepare database that
could be used for comparison of different automated
approaches we have selected only those recordings that
included umbilical artery pH. We added all additional outcome measures that were available for the recording in
the hospital information system. Some of these measures
are often misused and we will discuss their disadvantages below.

Figure 1 Selection of recordings for the final database. Flowchart diagram describing the process of data selection for the final database.
Outcome measure selection criteria To enable objective classification the pH measure was considered as
essential for the evaluation of the database.
• Umbilical artery pH (pH) – is the most commonly
used outcome measure, sign of respiratory hypoxia.
Records with missing pH were excluded. Following
suggestion by Rosen records, which had values of
pCO2 outside 95th percentile were excluded
except those with pH ≤7.05, which even according
to should be approached with care.
Additional outcome measures provided Even though
the is pH is the most commonly used measure, we
included additional measures such as following:
• Base excess (BE) – is often used in the clinical setting
as a sign for metabolic hypoxia, but is often false
positive .
• Base deficit in extracellular fluid (BDecf) – is
according to Rosén et al. a better measure of
metabolic hypoxia than BE. Still pH remains more
robust measure and according to last study of
Georgieva et al. remains the most informative .
• Neonatology – complete neonatological reports were
acquired for all the cases in pre-prepared database.
No severe cases of neonatal morbidity were found, no
hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, no seizures (for
details on neonatal morbidity see ).
• Subjective evaluation of the outcome of the delivery
based on Apgar’s score (Apgar), where five categories
Chudáˇcek et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2014, 14:16
 
 
are used to assess the newborn child in 1st, 5th and
10th minute .
The complete database was used for inter-intra observer
variability study. In this study 9 senior obstetricians evaluated CTG signals. The clinical evaluation will be added to
the database as soon as processed.
Signal criteria
When the data were filtered according to the clinical information, we have applied the following criteria on CTG
• Signal length – we have decided to include 90
minutes preceding the delivery, where the delivery
time represents also the time when the objective
(pH, etc.) evaluation of labor was acquired.
– I. stage – the length of the I. stage was limited
to a maximum of 60 minutes in order to keep
recordings easily comparable. The minimal
length was dependent on the pH of the
records in question – to include as much
abnormal records as possible. Thus the
minimal length of the I. stage of 30 minutes
was required for recording with pH ≤7.15
and 40 minutes for others. The time distance
from the end of the I.stage to birth was not
allowed to be larger than 30 minutes.
– II. stage – based on our previous experience
with analysis of the II. stage of labor (active
pushing phase), we limited the II. stage to 30
minutes at maximum. This also limits the
possibility of adverse events occurring in the
II. stage, which could disconnect CTG
recording in the I. stage with objective
evaluation of the delivery.
Given the restriction above the signals are 30(40)–90
minutes long depending on a) the length of the II.
stage and also b) available signal in the I. stage. No
signal ends earlier than 30 minutes before delivery.
• Missing signal – amount of missing signal was,
except for the II. stage, kept to possible minimum.
Nevertheless the trade-off between having full signal
and having recordings with abnormal outcomes had
to be made. No more than 50 % of signal was allowed
to be missing in the I. stage.
• Noise and artifacts – these are a problem especially
for the recordings acquired by the ultrasound probe.
Certainly in some recordings maternal heart rate is
intermittently present. But even though it can pose a
challenge for user of the database it also reflects the
clinical reality.
• Type of measurement device – the database is
composed as a mixture of recordings acquired by
ultrasound doppler probe, direct scalp measurement
or combination of both – again reflecting the clinical
reality at the obstetrics ward of UHB.
Description of the Database
Records for the CTU-UHB database were selected based
on clinical and technical criteria described above. Table 3
provides overview of patient and labor outcome measure
statistics and Table 4 presents main parameters regarding
the CTG signals. The CTG signals were transformed from
proprietary Philips format to open Physionet format ,
all data were anonymized at the hospital and de-identified
(relative time) at the CTU side. An example of one CTG
record is shown in Figure 2.
CTG database – vaginal deliveries
The main part of the CTG database consists of 506 intrapartum recordings delivered vaginally. It means the deliveries got always to the II. stage of labor (fully dilated
cervix, periodical contractions), even though not all deliveries had active pushing period. Some were delivered
operatively by means of forceps or vacuum extraction
(VEX). The main outcome measures are presented in
Tables 3 and 4.
Please note the column “Comment”, which gives additional information either with regard to the number of
potential outliers or points out interesting features of the

database such as number of pathological cases based on
certain parameters or quality of the recording in each
CTG database – deliveries by Caesarean Section
The database was selected to have the majority of intrapartum recordings with vaginal delivery. Nevertheless
due to low number of cases with severely-abnormal outcomes, we have decided to add all recordings delivered
by Cesarean Section (CS) with abnormal outcomes that
conformed with the requirements mentioned above (16
CS records). Additional 30 CS recordings with normal
outcome were randomly selected and added as a controlgroup. This control should enable the user of the database
to evaluate CS recordings separately, if necessary. The
details of the CS part of the database can be found in
Tables 3 and 4.
Additional perspectives on the database
In addition to the tables presented above four more tables
are included in the Additional files section. Additional
file 1: Table S5 and Additional file 2: Table S6 show the
structure of the database with respect to umbilical cord
artery pH values. The main reason for presentation of theses tables is to allow clear visibility of the features’ values
and their change with different pH. We are well aware
of the article of Yeh , which states that there is weak
relation between umbilical artery pH after delivery and
negative outcome to the baby. Nevertheless the pH still
remains the main “objective” parameter – a summary of
the delivery – as clearly presented in . Finally, two
short Tables S7 and S8 in the Additional file 3 describe different risk factors presented in the database again related
to umbilical cord artery pH on vaginal and CS part of the
database, respectively.
Utility and discussion
The CTU-UHB database is the first open-access database
for research on intrapartum CTG signal processing and
analysis. In the following paragraphs we will highlight the
subjects, that could, if unobserved, lead to problems with
use of the database.
The CTU-UHB users should be aware that there is a
possible noise in the clinical data, since some information
had to be mined from free text. Even though the whole
data was carefully checked it is possible that some noise
is present. However, this noise should not significantly
disrupt any results obtained. Also we note that, due to
the selection process, the database is biased from normal
population (disproportional amount of low pH deliveries
etc.) but this bias is evident in all other studies and, more
importantly, if we would keep the database in the original
form, the potential users would be forced to select the data
themselves – resulting in different selection criteria and
making, again, any comparison across studies infeasible.
From Table 2 it is evident that each study used different outcome measures, or their combinations. Again, this
makes any comparison across studies infeasible. There are
two main sources of evaluation: objective by e.g. umbilical artery pH, which is prominent example, and subjective
evaluation by experts according to their knowledge and/or
guidelines used. For the clarity reasons we will focus on
non-expert outcome measures, as those are discussed in
another recently prepared paper of our research group
(Spilka et al.: Analysis of CTG interpretation by expertobstetricians, submitted).
Exact relation of umbilical pH after delivery to
CTG/FHR is so far not fully understood, time between the
recording and actual delivery plays a crucial role, and it
seems that pH is only weakly correlated to clinical annotation . The best example is the timely CS due to
suspect CTG – the CTG is suspect/pathological but the
intervention prevented the baby to get into real asphyxia
that would be reflected in the pH value. Yeh claims
that there is only weak relation between pH and actual
outcome for the well-being of the baby. Following work

 on the same database relates low values of pH to
higher risk of clinical complications. From the studies
on cerebral palsy in neonates pH and BDecf are recommended as preferred measures even though 
says the opposite. Additionally intrapartum events and
cerebral palsy are very rarely related by the intrapartum
hypoxia only and the real outcome of the delivery can
be seen only in several years-long follow up .
There is no general agreement on the threshold, which
should be used to distinguish between the normal and
abnormal outcome of the delivery. There are several
used/supported possibilities.
• Cerebral Palsy – pH ≤7 together with BDecf ≤12
 was found to be related to significant increase of
the cerebral palsy.
• Pathological – pH ≤7.05 is used as a threshold
by most studies. Even though this value is not used
unanimously, it is generally accepted as the threshold
between pathological and not-pathological delivery
outcomes. Combination with BDecf was used e.g. in
• Abnormal (lower than normal) pH < 7.10 –
this value is supported by recent works on the large
Oxford database as well as used heuristically at the
UHB as a sign of severe problems with the delivery.
• Abnormal (lower than normal) pH < 7.15 .
• Abnormal (lower than normal) pH < 7.20 this
particular value is also mentioned as an threshold to
abnormal outcome pH by Irelands’ obstetrician
guidelines.
Regarding the Base deficit/base excess values the BDefc
established by is the only usable measure for assessment of metabolic hypoxia . Nevertheless in many
papers as well as in the clinical practice the base excess
(BE) is used erroneously .
In general pH is more robust but is affected more
by respiratory asphyxia, BDecf is more about metabolic
asphyxia. Regarding the reliability of the objective measurements they are in general much more reliable than
any expert opinion. Nevertheless biochemical measures
are very dependent on the measuring procedure – pH is
in general considered to be more robust than the BDecf
where it is necessary to use consideration about the pCO2
measurements .
Among undocumented parameters in the database,
which could influence the shape and/or different properties of FHR one could count e.g. smoking , which
can increase the heart rate, or epidural analgesia 
responsible for intermittent fetal bradycardia due maternal intermittent hypotension. Some risk factors can
influence the look of the FHR such as diabetes mellitus, where FHR looks more immature . Also technical

parameters can influence the FHR itself – such as size
of autocorrelation window for deriving FHR from ultrasound , or the derived parameters – such as power
spectral density (PSD) of FHR, which can be affected by
the type of interpolation .
Length of the data used is usually limited by the availability of the data. Really long signals (spanning from
the check-in to delivery) enable us to create individualized approach to each fetus with regard to its starting
point . We have much more information to analyze,
which can be positive or confusing based on the
point of view . Short signals such as e.g. 70 min long
 enables us to try to find direct relation between the
features measured and the outcome.
Another question is how to treat the II. stage of labor.
Will the length of it confuse the extracted features? General opinion on the second stage is that it is different from
the I. stage – in shape of the signal. It is also very often
noisy and it differs even in the clinical treatment where
obstetricians are much more lenient to apply operative
delivery in case of unclear trace .
Conclusion
The CTU-UHB database is the first open-access database
available for research on intrapartum CTG signal processing and analysis. It is available at the Physionet
website. The database is reasonably large and allows
researchers to develop algorithms/methods for CTG analysis and classification. Using CTU-UHB database – different approaches can be easily compared one with another
in the objective fashion. Intuitively, the use of common
database can stimulate the research in CTG signal processing and classification and move the community to
the ultimate goal – an automatic analysis of CTG and
its possible extension to a decision support system for
clinicians.
