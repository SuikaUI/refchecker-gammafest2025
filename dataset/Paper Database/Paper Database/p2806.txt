Background: B-cell epitopes are the sites of molecules that are recognized by antibodies of the
immune system. Knowledge of B-cell epitopes may be used in the design of vaccines and diagnostics
tests. It is therefore of interest to develop improved methods for predicting B-cell epitopes. In this
paper, we describe an improved method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes.
Results: In order to do this, three data sets of linear B-cell epitope annotated proteins were
constructed. A data set was collected from the literature, another data set was extracted from the
AntiJen database and a data sets of epitopes in the proteins of HIV was collected from the Los
Alamos HIV database. An unbiased validation of the methods was made by testing on data sets on
which they were neither trained nor optimized on. We have measured the performance in a nonparametric way by constructing ROC-curves.
Conclusion: The best single method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes is the hidden Markov
model. Combining the hidden Markov model with one of the best propensity scale methods, we
obtained the BepiPred method. When tested on the validation data set this method performs
significantly better than any of the other methods tested. The server and data sets are publicly
available at 
Background
Vaccines have mostly been composed of killed or attenuated whole pathogens. For safety reasons, however, it
could be desirable to use peptide vaccines that are able to
generate an immune response against a given pathogen
 . Such vaccines could contain peptides representing linear B-cell epitopes from the proteins of the pathogen.
Hughes et al. used linear B-cell epitopes to induce protective immunity in mice against P. aeruginosa. By immunizing animals, synthetic peptides containing linear B-cell
epitopes can also be used to raise antibodies against a specific protein, which e.g. can be used in screening assays or
as diagnostic tools .
B-cell epitopes are parts of proteins or other molecules
that antibodies (made by B-cells) bind. Most protein
epitopes are composed of different parts of the polypeptide chain that are brought into spatial proximity by the
folding of the protein. These epitopes are called discontinuous, but for approximately 10% of the epitopes, the corresponding antibodies are cross-reactive with a linear
peptide fragment of the epitope . These epitopes are
denoted linear or continuous and are mainly composed
of a single stretch of the polypeptide chain.
Even though linear B-cell epitopes thus are of limited relevance in the detailed understanding of a humoral immune

response, identification of such linear peptide segments will
often be the initial step in the search for antigenic determinants in pathogenic organisms. The traditional experimental
peptide scanning approach is clearly not feasible on a
genomic scale. Prediction methods are very cost effective
and reliable methods for predicting linear B-cell epitopes
would therefore be a first step in guiding a genome wide
search for B-cell antigens in pathogenic organism.
The classical way of predicting linear B-cell epitopes is by
the use of propensity scale methods. These methods
assign a propensity value to every amino acid, based on
studies of their physico-chemical properties. Fluctuations
in the sequence of prediction values are reduced by applying a running average window. This prediction procedure
was first developed by Hopp and Woods .
Pellequer et al. compared several propensity scale
methods using a data set of 14 epitope annotated proteins. They found that applying the scales by Parker et al.
 (hydrophilicity), Chou and Fasman and Levitt 
(secondary structure) and by Emini et al. (accessibility) gave slightly better results than the other scales
Alix developed a program called PEOPLE, which predicts the location of linear B-cell epitopes using combinations of propensity scale methods. Odorico have
developed a program, BEPITOPE, for predicting the location
of linear B-cell epitopes using propensity scale methods.
Recently, Blythe and Flower studied the performance
of many propensity scale methods and found that even
the best methods predict only marginally better than a
random model. They made a thorough study using a data
set of 50 epitope mapped proteins from the AntiJen web
page .
In this study, we have developed a novel method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes, BepiPred, which is found to
perform both significantly better than random predictions as well as significantly better than a number of tested
propensity scales.
Even though the present method is a significant improvement over earlier methods for predicting linear B-cell
epitopes, it still has major limitations. There is a need for
further improvements in predictive power before such systems become generally useful to provide reliable predictions of B-cell epitopes.
Predictions by propensity scale methods
We first tested a number of propensity scale methods on
the Pellequer data set . For every scale and window
size, a ROC-curve and area under it, the Aroc-value, was calculated as a measure of the prediction accuracy. 1000
bootstrap samples were drawn from the predictions in
order to estimate the standard error of the Aroc-value,
. The best scale was found to be the one by Levitt 
(window size of 11, Aroc = 0.658 ± 0.013). This method
with will be denoted Levitt. The second best scale is the
scale by Parker et al. (window size 9, Aroc = 0.654 ±
0.013), denoted Parker. The other scales, that were tested,
did not perform as well as the scales by Parker et al. 
and Levitt .
Performing a permutation experiment 1000 times, we
estimated the P-value for the hypothesis that a method
performs like a random model, where the alternative
hypothesis is that it performs better than a random
model. The resulting P-values for Parker and Levitt were
both below 0.1%.
Predictions by hidden Markov models
Experiments were conducted in which hidden Markov
models (HMMs) were used for the prediction of the location of linear B-cell epitopes. The methods were build
from positive windows extracted from the AntiJen data
set. The HMMs were tested on the Pellequer data set to
find the optimal parameters. Different sizes of the
extracted peptide windows, different weights of pseudo
count correction for estimating the amino acid frequencies and different sizes of the smoothing window were
tested. For the best method, the size of the extracted windows was found to be 5, the size of the smoothing window was 9 and the pseudo-count correction was 107. The
performance of the method on the Pellequer data set was
Aroc = 0.663 ± 0.012. This method with these parameters
will be denoted HMM.
Combining methods
In order to make more accurate predictions, the hidden
Markov model (HMM) was combined with one of the two
best propensity scale methods (Parker and Levitt). The
combinations were done as weighted sums of normalized
prediction values. The sum of the weights on the two
methods was kept equal to one and different weight-pairs
were tested. The Pellequer data set was used to optimize
the parameter values. The combination methods with the
highest Aroc-values were chosen for further comparisons
and are shown in Table 1. The combinational method
with the highest Aroc-value is denoted BepiPred and it is
the candidate method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes
in this paper. It is a combination of HMM and Parker.

Validating the methods
To make an unbiased validation of the methods, tests
were performed on an independent data set, the HIV data
set. The results are shown in Table 2. BepiPred is again
seen to be the best method. ROC-curves for the selected
methods are shown in Figure 1, and chosen values are
given in Table 3.
Paired t-tests were performed for the predictions on the
HIV data set to determine if one method had a prediction
accuracy that was significant higher than another. Table 4
shows that BepiPred was found to be significantly better
than all other tested methods, and that HMM was not significantly better than Parker.
Discussion
We have constructed a prediction method for linear B-cell
epitopes using a hidden Markov model. Hidden Markov
models have not been used for this specific purpose
Our method has a quite low sensitivity. One way of
increasing the sensitivity is to lower the applied threshold,
but that would also lead to a lower specificity. Pellequer et
al. showed that a reduction of over-predictions could
be done by combining prediction curves, and further
improvements of B-cell epitope prediction methods may
be obtained using similar approaches.
Pellequer et al. have made a comparison of several
propensity scales using one of the data sets in the present
study: the Pellequer dataset. They made a study applying
some propensity scale methods to the data set and used a
fixed threshold of 0.7 s, where s is the standard deviation
of the prediction values. This threshold classified the predictions as positive or negative. They found that the predictions using the different scales were better than
random, complying with the findings of the present study.
They compared the scales on a data set consisting of nine
of the sequences and found that the scales by Parker et al.
 , Chou and Fasman , Levitt and of Emini et al. 
gave slightly better results than the other scales tested.
In the present study, we found that for a similar data set,
the scales that performed best were constructed by Levitt
 and Parker et al. . This corresponds well with the
findings of Pellequer et al. .
Blythe and Flower have found that even the best propensity scale methods perform only marginally better
than a random model. They used a data set of 50 epitope
mapped proteins from the AntiJen home page http://
www.jenner.ac.uk/AntiJen and applied many propensity scale methods to the data.
Our permutation tests showed that the scales by Parker et
al. and Levitt with their optimal window sizes were
performing significantly better than random models.

We have tested several propensity scale methods and optimized their parameters in order to identify the best
method. For the Pellequer data set, the best method was
found to be the scale by with a window size of 11. The
second best propensity scale method was the scale by
Parker et al. with a window size of 7–11. This scale was
intended to be used with a window size of 7 by the
authors, which corresponds well with our findings.
Conclusion
We present a novel method for predicting linear B-cell
epitopes, BepiPred. It is a combination method, made by
combining the predictions of a hidden Markov model and
the propensity scale by Parker et al. . We have tested different parameters in order to optimize the hidden Markov
model and the propensity scale method.
We have tested the methods using the non-parametric
ROC-curves and made an unbiased validation using a separate data set. We found that BepiPred had the highest
prediction accuracy on the test data set, and it is shown to
perform significantly better than all other methods tested
on the validation data set. Comparing BepiPred with the
best propensity scale methods on the validation data set,
for a specificity of 80% the sensitivity for BepiPred, the
scale by Parker et al. and by Levitt is 30.9%, 28.8%
and 26.8%, respectively.
Future work could include using data from other sources,
such as the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis
Resource, IEDB , or the Epitome database of structurally inferred antigenic epitopes in proteins http://
www.rostlab.org/services/epitome.
Three data sets of proteins with linear B-cell epitope annotation were used in these studies. All data sets were constructed by measuring the cross-reactivity between the
intact protein and the peptide fragment .
The Pellequer data set
A data set was used for the tests and optimization of the
methods. Since this dataset was unavailable in an electronic form it was recreated by Lund et al. . The
epitope annotations were taken from Pellequer et al. 
and references herein. An exception was the sequence of
scorpion neurotoxin, in which the data was taken from
 . This data set, denoted the Pellequer data set, contains 14 protein sequences and 83 epitopes. The epitope
density is 0.34.
The AntiJen data set
A second data set was used to train and build the hidden
Markov model. This data set was extracted from the Anti-
database, formerly
JenPep 
ner.ac.uk/AntiJen. This data set, denoted the AntiJen data
set, consists of 127 protein sequences, and the epitope
density is 0.08. The proteins of this data set are not fully
annotated, and the annotation for the non-epitope
stretches is not known.
The HIV data set
A separate data set was made allowing an unbiased validation of the methods. It consists of epitopes found in the
proteins of HIV taken from the HIV Molecular Immunology Database of the Los Alamos National Laboratory
 The epitopes in this data set
are overlapping to some degree. Therefore a procedure for
determining more accurate borders of the minimal
epitopes was applied to the epitopes. If a smaller epitope
was contained as part of a larger epitope, the larger
epitope was discarded from the data set. Two of the
sequences had no assigned epitopes and were therefore
discarded from the data set. The HIV data set consists of
10 protein sequences and the epitope density is 0.38.
Propensity scale methods
The propensity scale methods assign a propensity value to
every amino acid of the query protein sequence. Fluctuations are reduced by applying a running mean window. In
the N- and C- termini we used asymmetric windows to
avoid discarding prediction examples. The scales used in
this study are based on antigenicity , hydrophilicity
 , inverted hydrophobicity , accessibility and
secondary structure .
Hidden Markov models
Let i = (i1, i2, ..., iw) denote a sequence of amino acids,
which has been extracted from a protein sequence. Let j
denote the position in this window, j = 1...w. On basis of
i, the hidden Markov model predicts if the center position
of the window is annotated as part of an epitope. In the Nand C-termini, parts of the extracted windows are exceeding the terminals. For these residues, the character 'X' is
Table 4: P values (in %) for the comparisons of methods. If a Pvalue is below the chosen significance level of 5%, the alternative
hypothesis, which is that the method to the left is more accurate
than the method at the top, can be accepted. The methods were
validated on the HIV data set.

used, which does not count when the hidden Markov
model is used for the predictions. The prediction score for
a window is given by
which is the log odds of the residue at the center position
of the window is being part of an epitope (Epitope model)
as opposed to if it is occurring by chance (Random
To construct the Random model, background frequencies
of the Swiss-Prot database , qi, is used. For the Epitope
model, pi,j is the effective amino acid probability of having
amino acid i at position j according to the model.
To calculate the values of pi,j, all windows, for which their
center position is annotated as part of an epitope, are
extracted from atraining data set. Again, if an extracted
window exceeds the N or C terminal, the character 'X' is
used, which does not count when calculating the parameters.
These extracted peptide windows form a matrix of aligned
peptides of the width w. From this alignment, pi,j is calculated as the pseudo count corrected probability of occurrence of amino acid i in column j, estimated as in . To
make the pseudo count correction, pseudo count frequencies, gi,j, are calculated. They are given by
where pk,j is the observed frequency of amino acid k in column j of the alignment . The variable bi,k is the Blosum
62 substitution matrix frequency, e.g. the frequency of
which i is aligned to k .
To give an example of using (2), let the window size, w =
1. The model is then only covering residues, which are
annotated as being part of linear B-cell epitopes. If the
observed peptides consists of the following single amino
acid sequences L and V, with the frequencies pL,1 = 0.5 and
pV,1 = 0.5, then the pseudo-count frequency for e.g. I is
The effective amino acid frequencies are calculated as a
weighted average of the observed frequency and the
pseudo count frequency,
Here, α is the effective number of sequences in the alignment - 1, and β is the pseudo count correction , which
is also called the weight on low counts. To finish the calculation example, let β be very large as it is in this work.
Then pI,1 ≈ gI,1 = 0.14.
Note that we shall use the term hidden Markov model
throughout this work to refer to the weight matrix generated using (1). The parameters of the ungapped Markov
model are calculated using a so-called Gibbs sampler,
written by Nielsen et al. .
The result of applying (1) is a prediction score for every
residue of the query sequence. To reduce fluctuations, a
smoothing window is applied to every position. It is made
asymmetric in the N- and C- termini in order to conserve
prediction examples.
ROC-curves
The result of applying a prediction method to a data set is
a set of prediction examples, x = (x1, x2, ...,xN). Let n
denote the residue number. Every xn consists of a target
value and a predicted value. If the residue is annotated as
part of an epitope, the target value is 1, zero otherwise. If
asymmetric smoothing windows are used in the N- and Ctermini, the variable N is equal to the number of residues
in the data set.
According to a variable threshold, the prediction examples are classified as positives or negatives, and according
to the target values, the predictions can be true or false.
The predictions can be either true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP) or false negatives (FN).
The prediction accuracy is measured by constructing
Receiver Operational Characteristics, ROC, curves .
For every value of the threshold, the true positive proportion, TP/(TP+FN), and the false positive proportion, FP/
(FP+TN), is calculated. A ROC-curve is constructed by
plotting the false positive proportion against the true positive proportion for all values of the threshold. It is therefore a non-parametric measure.
The sensitivity is equal to the true positive proportion,
and the specificity, given by TN/(FP+TN), is equal to 1 –
the false positive proportion. In this way, a ROC-curve is
displaying the trade-off between the sensitivity and the
specificity for all possible thresholds. A good method has

a high true positive proportion when it has a low false
positive proportion. A such model has a high sensitivity
and a high specificity. The performance of the method is
measured as the area under the curve, the Aroc-value. For a
random prediction, the true positive proportion is equal
to the false positive proportion for every value of the
threshold. Then Aroc = 0.5. For a perfect method, Aroc = 1.
Bootstrapping
Bootstrapping is used to estimate the standard error of the
Aroc-value,
as a measure of the uncertainty of the
Aroc-value . The relation between the standard error
and the standard deviation, s, is that se =
, where r is
the number of repeats of the underlying experiment .
Bootstrapping is a method for generating pseudo-replica
(bootstrap samples) of the predictions, denoted x*, which
deviate a little from x. The bootstrap sample, x* =
, is defined as a random sample of size N,
drawn with replacement from x. Some of the prediction
examples from x may appear zero times, some one time,
some twice etc. Drawing a bootstrap sample can in other
words be done by copying randomly chosen prediction
examples, xn, from x into x*. In this way, some variation
from x is introduced into x*.
Totally B bootstrap samples are drawn. Let x*b denote the
b'th bootstrap sample. The prediction accuracy of x*b is
calculated as
The result of the bootstrap experiment is x*1, x*2,...,x*B and

the standard deviation is calculated.
approaches the
original Aroc-value as B gets large.
Paired t-tests
A paired t-test is performed in order to determine if one
method is more accurate than another. The H0-hypothesis
for this test is that two means are equal, µ1 = µ2. Instead of
and hence Aroc is used. The starting point is the
performance measures of the two methods, Aroc,M1 and
Aroc,M2, where M1 denotes method 1. By bootstrapping we
have the vectors
. Every bootstrap
are drawn identically for every b,
making the two Aroc-values paired.
The H0-hypothesis is therefore Aroc,M1 = Aroc,M2 and the
alternative hypothesis Aroc,M1 > Aroc,M2. The test statistic t is
The paired difference of the b'th bootstrap samples, Db, is

Db. The test statistic is following a t-distribution with m =
B - 1 degrees of freedom, which approaches the normal
distribution for m > 30, then t ≈ z. The P-value for the test
is then given by 1 - F(z), where F(z) is the cumulative normal distribution. See for more information about the
paired t-test.
Permutation tests
When testing the H0-hypothesis that a method performs
like a random model, a permutation experiment can be
made. The alternative hypothesis is that the method is
performing better than a random model. From the predictions of the method, x, the target values are permuted to
result in a new prediction set, xperm,p. This is done for p =
1...pmax. For every p, the prediction accuracy is calculated
. The P-value for the H0-hypothesis is calculated
as the proportion of times for which
