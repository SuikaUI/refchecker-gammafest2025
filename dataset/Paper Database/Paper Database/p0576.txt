Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a crucial technology that
will play a leading role in the fourth industrial revolu­
tion. To date, many experts have discussed the role and
scope of AI in dramatically increasing diagnostic effi­
ciency in medical practice, making accurate decisions,
and addressing the issue of medical staffing shortages . Integrating AI technology in healthcare products and
services will enable healthcare professionals to use AI for
patient monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment and help
integrate various environmental, genomic, health, and
sociodemographic data. In addition, integrating data and
enhancing information utilization with AI-based tech­
nology will contribute to achieving a higher standard of

Background  Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has recently seen rapid advancement, with an expanding role and
scope in nursing education and healthcare. This study identifies the influence of AI ethics awareness, attitude toward
AI, anxiety, and self-efficacy on nursing students’ behavioral intentions to use AI-based healthcare technology.
Methods  The participants included 189 nursing students in Gyeonggi-do, with data collected from November
to December 2021 using self-reported questionnaires. We analyzed the data using the SPSS/WIN 26.0 program,
including a t-test, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and hierarchical multiple linear regression.
Results  The results revealed that AI ethical awareness (t = − 4.32, p < .001), positive attitude toward AI (t = − 2.60,
p = .010), and self-efficacy (t = − 2.65, p = .009) scores of the third and fourth-year nursing students were higher,
while their anxiety scores were lower (t = 2.30, p = .022) compared to the scores of the first and second-year nursing
students. The factors influencing behavioral intention included a positive attitude toward AI (β = 0.58) and self-efficacy
(β = 0.22). The adjusted R2 was 0.42.
Conclusion  It is necessary to inculcate a positive attitude toward AI and self-efficacy by providing educational
programs on AI-based technology in healthcare settings.

nursing care, strengthening nurses’ competencies, and
providing evidence-based individual quality of nursing
care to meet patient goals and priorities .
The use of AI in nursing has already taken place in the
analysis of electronic nursing records, clinical decision
support through analysis of pressure sores and safety
risks, nursing robots, and scheduling . However,
despite positive performance and utilization expecta­
tions from introducing and expanding AI technology in
the healthcare setting, there are growing concerns. These
concerns relate to various unpredictable problems, dis­
crimination and ethical issues caused by malfunctions
and incomplete technology of AI medical devices, distor­
tion and bias of information due to lack of accumulated
data or learning errors in AI, and invasion of privacy is
also growing . AI ethics are the behaviors, lifestyles,
principles, and technologies that transcend national
boundaries, upheld among individuals, companies, soci­
eties, and between robots . Increased awareness of
AI ethics led to national and international AI ethical
standards . Evaluating nursing students’ AI ethics
subsequently enables assessing educational needs and
introducing relevant content into the nursing education
curriculum.
Meanwhile, people’s attitudes toward AI play an
important role in accepting AI. For instance, Wagner
and Sherwood reported that a learner’s positive
attitude toward information technology (IT) reduced
their anxiety about IT, promoted IT use or interactions,
and improved confidence in problem-solving through
IT. Additionally, attitudes toward IT affected emotions,
behaviors, and ideas about IT, emphasizing the learners’
importance of a positive attitude toward IT. Furthermore,
studies have shown that more experience using IT, such
as AI, can lead to less fear and anxiety for a bet­
ter understanding of AI. Subsequently, students familiar
with AI tended to show more optimistic and passionate
attitudes toward AI-related work than their counterparts
 . Therefore, to resolve the ethical issues and con­
flicts associated with AI, proper understanding of AI,
and awareness and education regarding ethical decisionmaking standards, must come first. Thus, nurses can
escape their anxiety and negative attitudes toward AI and
recognize AI as a co-existing healthcare technician to
minimize confusion and build trust among patients and
caregivers.
Nurses and nursing students are potential users of AIbased technology and are in a pivotal position to shape
and lead the use of AI within the nursing field .
However, a recent study reported that more than 70%
of nurses and nursing students did not understand AI in
clinical practice. This thinking is despite believing that
AI will revolutionize nursing and healthcare by improv­
ing health promotion and disease prevention, support
for establishing personalized treatment plans, work auto­
mation, and teamwork between professionals . In
other words, while nurses demonstrated a high degree of
awareness regarding the usefulness and efficiency of AI
technology, no studies have identified the self-efficacy,
attitude, and intention to use AI in providing nursing
care. Moreover, with the rapid evolution of AI-based
technology and demand for AI education in nursing, we
require developing and advancing nurses’ job competen­
cies and roles to enable them to learn relevant knowledge
and increase their understanding of extensive data and
utilization . Consequently, there is a need to under­
stand nursing students’ attitudes, self-efficacy, and inten­
tions to use AI to educate prospective nurses to lead and
adapt to these changes in technology in nursing. There­
fore, this study assessed nursing students’ ethical aware­
ness, attitude, anxiety, and self-efficacy toward AI and
identified the factors influencing behavioral intention to
use AI-based healthcare technologies.
Study Design
We conducted a cross-sectional study to identify factors
affecting nursing students’ behavioral intentions to use
AI-based healthcare technology.
Study participants
The participants were 189 nursing students in Gyeonggido, Korea. We obtained permission for participant
recruitment from the dean of a nursing department at a
local university in Gyeonggi-do. The target participants
were first to fourth-year nursing students. We posted a
recruitment note on the nursing notice board for ten
days. Then a research assistant visited classrooms during
break time, verbally explained the purpose of the study,
and distributed questionnaires to nursing students who
voluntarily agreed to participate. We recruited those
who understood the purpose of this study and provided
consent for participation. We collected data from Febru­
ary 16−23, 2022, and determined the sample size using
G*Power software (version 3.1.7, Heinrich-Heine-Univer­
sity, Germany). For multiple regression analysis, we used
behavioral intention as a dependent variable. Based on
the effect size of 0.15, significance level (⍺) of 0.05, statis­
tical power (1-β) of 0.95, and 11 arbitrary predictors (six
demographic characteristics, AI ethics awareness, two
attitudes, anxiety, and self-efficacy), we calculated the
minimum sample size as 178. We distributed the ques­
tionnaires to 195 students. We had 189 questionnaires
in the final analysis, indicating a dropout rate of 3.1%; we
excluded one questionnaire with insincere responses, one
with an abnormal Z-score, and four with outliers in the
regression analysis.

Measurements
AI Ethics Awareness
We measured AI ethics awareness using the Test for
Artificial Intelligence Ethics Awareness (TAIEA), a tool
developed by Kim and Shin . It consists of 24 items in
eight categories (responsibility, stability and reliability, no
discrimination, transparency and explainability, humancentered service, employment, allowance and restric­
tion, and robot rights). We used a five-point Likert scale
(1 point for “strongly disagree” to 5 points for “strongly
agree”) to rate each item. The higher the score, the higher
the level of ethical awareness. Cronbach’s α of the tool
was 0.81 at the time of development and 0.67 in this
General Attitudes toward Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS)
We used the GAAIS to measure attitude toward AI. The
measurement scale comprised 20 items, including 12
positive and eight negative attitudes toward AI . After
obtaining approval from the original developer of the
tool, we translated and back-translated it for use. Partici­
pants rated each item on a five-point Likert scale (1 point
for “strongly disagree” to 5 points for “strongly agree”). A
higher score in a positive category means that partici­
pants have a more positive attitude. We did not reversescore the items on negative attitudes; therefore, higher
scores in a negative category meant that participants had
more negative attitudes toward AI. The Cronbach’s α of
the positive and negative attitudes were 0.88 and 0.83,
respectively, at the time of development , and 0.85
and 0.76, respectively, in this study.
We used questions from the Technology Acceptance
Model (TAM) developed by Venkatesh et al. to mea­
sure anxiety. In addition, we changed the term “technol­
ogy” and/or “system” to “AI-based technology within the
healthcare setting.” The tool comprised four items on
anxiety regarding the use of AI technology, and partici­
pants rated each item on a five-point Likert scale (1 point
for “strongly disagree” to 5 points for “strongly agree”).
Cronbach’s α of the tool was ≥ 0.70 in previous studies
 and 0.86 in this study.
Self-efficacy
We used questions from the TAM by Venkatesh et al. 
to measure self-efficacy, consisting of four items. Partici­
pants rated each item on a five-point Likert scale (1 point
for “strongly disagree” to 5 points for “strongly agree”),
with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy in using
AI-based technology. Cronbach’s α of the tool was ≥ 0.80
in previous studies and 0.75 in this study.
Behavioral intention
We applied questions from the TAM by Venkatesh et
al. to measure behavioral intention to use AI-based
technology. Participants rated three items on a five-point
Likert scale (1 point for “strongly disagree” to 5 points
for “strongly agree”), with higher scores indicating higher
behavioral intention to use AI-based technology. Cron­
bach’s α of the tool was ≥ 0.80 in a previous study and
0.66 in this study.
Ethical considerations
We conducted this study after receiving the institutional
review board’s approval (1041078-202112-HR-342-01).
We informed all voluntary participants about the pur­
pose of the research and ensured that all responses were
anonymous. Data collected using questionnaires were
coded and entered into a database without personally
identifiable information. We compensated all partici­
pants for their participation.
Data Analysis
We used the SPSS WIN 26.0 Program (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, USA) for data analysis. First, we analyzed
participants’ general characteristics using frequency
analysis and descriptive statistics. Next, we analyzed the
measured variable scores according to general character­
istics using t-tests and the correlation between variables
using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Finally, we con­
firmed the factors affecting nursing students’ behavioral
intentions to use AI-based healthcare technology using
hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis.
General characteristics of the participants
The participants included 162 females (85.7%, Mage =
23.89); the majority were second-year students (n = 123;
65.1%). The average Internet usage time, excluding the
time used for learning purposes, was 4.27  h. The main
reasons for using the Internet were messenger/social net­
working services, watching movies/TV/videos, searching
for information, and playing games, in that order. The
group included 36 students (19.0%) who had participated
in AI-related education (Table 1).
Differences in measured variables by demographic
characteristics
Analysis of the measured variables according to demo­
graphic characteristics showed no statistically significant
differences in AI ethics awareness, positive and negative
attitudes toward AI, anxiety, self-efficacy, and behav­
ioral intention scores according to gender, age, Inter­
net use time, and AI education experience. However,
the third and fourth-year students showed significantly
higher AI ethics awareness, positive attitudes toward
 
Kwak et al. BMC Nursing 21:267
AI, self-efficacy scores, and significantly lower anxiety
scores than first and second-year students. In addition,
the behavioral intention score of the third and fourthyear nursing students was higher than in other years, and
the difference in scores was close to the significance level
(p = .053) (Table 2).
Correlations between AI Ethics Awareness, attitude toward
AI, anxiety, Self-Efficacy, and behavioral intention
Table  3 describes the correlations between AI ethics
awareness, attitude toward AI, anxiety, self-efficacy, and
behavioral intention. There were statistically significant
correlations among all measured variables. Positive atti­
tude toward AI (r = − .62) and self-efficacy (r = .51) showed
the highest correlation with behavioral intention. Selfefficacy positively correlated with AI ethics awareness
(r = − .25) and negatively correlated with negative atti­
tudes toward AI (r = − .31) and anxiety (r = − .34). Anxiety
had a positive correlation with a negative attitude toward
AI (r = .44). In contrast, AI ethics awareness had a posi­
tive correlation with a positive attitude toward AI (r = .31)
(Table 3).
Factors Associated with the behavioral intention to use
AI-based Healthcare Technologies
We performed linear regression analysis to analyze the
effects of AI ethics awareness, positive and negative
attitudes toward AI, anxiety, and self-efficacy—which
showed significant differences in ANOVA and correlation
analysis—on behavioral intention. The regression model
was statistically significant (F = 28.38, p < .001) and had
an explanatory power of 42.1%. The results showed no
problem with multicollinearity with a variance inflation
factor (VIF) of 1.30–1.71. Moreover, the Durbin-Watson
test showed d = 1.91, indicating no autocorrelation of

residuals. The regression analysis showed that a positive
attitude toward AI (β = 0.58) and self-efficacy (β = 0.22)
were the two variables that had a significant influence
on nursing students’ behavioral intentions to use AIbased healthcare technology. The results showed R2 and
adjusted R2 of 0.44 and 0.42, respectively (Table 4).
Discussion
This study evaluated the level of ethical awareness, atti­
tude toward AI, anxiety, and self-efficacy and identified
the factors influencing nursing students’ intentions to use
AI-based health technology. As a result of analyzing the
measurement variables according to the general char­
acteristics, the third and fourth-year students showed
significantly higher AI ethics awareness, positive atti­
tudes toward AI, and self-efficacy, and significantly lower
anxiety scores than the first and second-year students. In
addition, the difference in behavior intention scores was
also close to the significance level. The nursing education
curriculum in Korea specifies that third and fourth-year
students participate in clinical practice training. Clini­
cal practice requires a basic knowledge of technologies
related to nursing skills and medical equipment. There­
fore, students encounter AI technology applications in
health settings during such classes based on active learn­
ing tasks that familiarize them with various technologies
and advance their nursing skills and theoretical knowl­
edge. This exposure to AI technologies and build-up of
experience creates a positive attitude toward the per­
ceived usefulness of technology. It can also improve the
students’ intentions to use AI technology . A previ­
ous study reported that fourth-year nursing students
showed the most positive attitudes toward technology, as
they had already had more opportunities to participate
in technology education . This result could be from
expectations and familiarity with healthcare technol­
ogy among third and fourth-year nursing students who
frequently have direct and indirect experiences with AI
health technologies (AIHTs) in clinical practice, leading
to increased positive attitudes toward AI. As a result,
this attitude positively affects AI ethics awareness, selfefficacy, and behavioral intention, ultimately reducing
This study showed a positive correlation between AI
ethics awareness and positive attitudes toward AI, selfefficacy, and behavioral intention. On the other hand,
AI ethics awareness negatively correlated with negative
attitudes toward AI and anxiety. According to the EU’s
“Potential Benefits of Artificial Intelligence and Ethi­
cal Considerations” brief report, using AI requires effort
through appropriate regulations, ethical considerations,
education, and research to achieve the purpose of good
intentions . Regarding AI ethics awareness, firmer
ideal ethical beliefs raise greater awareness about the
applicability of AI, ethical dignity of AI, and fairness of
AI ethics; stronger relative ethical beliefs tend to lower
the attention to the adverse effects of AI . In the com­
ing intelligent information society led by AI, one must
include AI ethics in the nursing curriculum to allow more
individuals to benefit from technology and minimize
dysfunction and adverse effects associated with AI .
Anxiety factors have a negative impact on the intention
to use AI. Providing nursing students information on the
usefulness and benefits of AI technology can improve

their choice to use AI and their acceptance of AI-based
technology .
Approximately 81% of the participants in this study
responded that they had no experience in AI education;
therefore, it would have been difficult to induce changes
in the subject’s ethical awareness, attitudes, and self-effi­
cacy toward AI. Only a few studies on AI ethics included
a wide range of healthcare workers. Studies that identi­
fied and compared the ethical values among healthcare
workers and ethical standards for new AI technologies
are even more scarce. Accordingly, it is necessary to pro­
vide basic data related to AI ethics through replication
studies. In previous studies on medical students in the
United States and the United Kingdom, few students had
received an AI education. Most students responded that
the current education was not sufficiently helpful in pre­
paring for new technologies in healthcare, despite their
awareness of the importance of AI and related education
 . With AI becoming a vital part of nursing and
healthcare, researchers recognize the need for AI-related
knowledge, skills, and competencies. However, previous
studies have found that students’ knowledge and techni­
cal competencies fell short of the levels needed in clinical
practice .
These results confirm the insufficiencies in nursing
education regarding students’ abilities to use AI-based
healthcare technologies, indicating the need for devel­
oping nursing education programs in educational insti­
tutions and clinical practices that would allow students
to participate in practical training safely and effectively
 . These findings also suggest the need for education
in data literacy, technical literacy, systems thinking, AI
algorithms, and AI’s ethical meaning to improve nursing
competency . Educating nursing students in AI is
essential, including the ethical use of AI and technology
and protecting patients from potential threats . As
AI utilization expands to improve human convenience,
developing and enhancing awareness of the world’s com­
mon AI ethical principles and providing related ethics
education is necessary. Furthermore, AI can directly or
indirectly affect patients’ health management, quality of
life, and prognosis in healthcare settings. Thus, a system­
atic education program to promote understanding, use,
and ethical education in AI will strengthen the nursing
competency that can actively adapt to patient protection
and rapid changes in the healthcare environment.
This research showed that positive attitudes toward
AI and self-efficacy influenced nursing students’ behav­
ioral intentions to use AI-based technologies. Attitudes
toward IT influence emotions, behaviors, and ideas about
IT; thus, learners need to have a positive attitude toward
IT . Increased awareness of AI technology use leads
to active behavioral intention and attitude, while atti­
tude influences experience, self-efficacy, motivation,
and beliefs . We found that attitudes affected
learners’ academic achievements and various factors such
as efficacy, motivations, and beliefs . Learners with a
positive attitude toward IT may be more motivated to
learn using IT and can develop various IT-related ideas.
As such, as the use of IT increases, anxiety about IT will
decrease, forming a positive attitude . Regarding
technology acceptance, self-efficacy can change behav­
ioral intentions by raising awareness about technology’s
ease of use and sufficient knowledge . From a tech­
nology acceptance perspective, self-efficacy can enhance
understanding regarding ease of use, which can positively
influence behavioral intention to use . Positive
awareness of AIHTs among nursing managers influenced
positive attitudes, while nursing educators played a cru­
cial role in preparing nurses and nursing students for
AIHTs . Therefore, it is necessary to enhance selfefficacy and positive attitudes by providing educational
programs on AIHTs.
Further, the study findings showed that AI ethics
awareness did not significantly influence behavioral
intention. Regarding the TAIEA tool used in this study,
the researchers initially only reported expert validity and
reliability. Accordingly, we deleted many items for con­
struct validation in this study. Nevertheless, the internal
reliability of the tool was only 0.69, indicating a need for
the tool’s further revision and verification. Therefore, we
need follow-up studies on developing research tools and
AI ethics awareness.
Nursing students’ positive attitudes toward AI and
improvements in self-efficacy can increase their behav­
ioral intentions toward using AI-based healthcare tech­
nology applications. Providing nursing students with
education on AI technology’s performance, usefulness,
and social influence in health settings will thus lead to
a positive attitude. It will also provide an opportunity
to directly and indirectly experience AI-based health­
care technology and intervention in clinical settings,
increase nurses’ self-efficacy, and improve their behav­
ioral intentions.
This study had some limitations. First, we collected
data from nursing students at a single nursing college,
and most participants did not have previous experience
in AI education. Therefore, there are limitations in gen­
eralizing this study’s findings. Second, when research­
ers initially developed the TAIEA tool, they did not
perform factor analysis. Thus, we excluded items with
low factor loading after factor analysis for item analysis
and construct validation from the analysis. Accordingly,
to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the measure­
ment tool, we need follow-up studies after developing a
tool for measuring AI ethics awareness that reflects the
characteristics of nursing and healthcare fields. Finally,
to develop competencies among nursing students to use

AI-based technology and meet the demands of the times,
it is necessary to create an innovative undergraduate cur­
riculum with opportunities to practice digital healthcare
technologies, including AI and AI ethics and algorithms.
Conclusion
In this study, only 19.1% of the participants had experi­
ence with AI-related education. However, students with
practical clinical training showed significantly higher
AI ethics, positive attitudes toward AI, self-efficacy, and
behavioral intention scores while having significantly
lower anxiety scores than first and second-year stu­
dents. Moreover, we identified positive attitudes toward
AI and self-efficacy as influencing factors on behavioral
intention. Such findings indicate the need for enhanc­
ing positive attitudes toward AI and self-efficacy through
educational programs on AI technology in healthcare
settings. Moreover, there is also an urgent need for nurs­
ing curriculum reform in educational institutions and
clinical practice that would allow nursing students to par­
ticipate in practical training safely and effectively in this
age of AI. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the educa­
tional experience related to AI. In particular, it is impera­
tive to develop and apply various educational programs
based on ethical awareness, relevant information, and
the usage of AI technology in healthcare settings before
nurses enter clinical practice. In addition, introducing AI
content in the nursing curriculum will improve nursing
students’ positive attitudes and self-efficacy toward AI
technology within the clinical field.
