ABSTRACT: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are
notoriously challenging to study both experimentally and
computationally. The structure of IDPs cannot be described by
a single conformation but must instead be described as an
ensemble of interconverting conformations. Atomistic simulations are increasingly used to obtain such IDP conformational
ensembles. Here, we have compared the IDP ensembles
generated by eight all-atom empirical force ﬁelds against
primary small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and NMR data.
Ensembles obtained with diﬀerent force ﬁelds exhibit marked
diﬀerences in chain dimensions, hydrogen bonding, and
secondary structure content. These diﬀerences are unexpectedly large: changing the force ﬁeld is found to have a stronger
eﬀect on secondary structure content than changing the entire peptide sequence. The CHARMM 22* ensemble performs best in
this force ﬁeld comparison: it has the lowest error in chemical shifts and J-couplings and agrees well with the SAXS data. A high
population of left-handed α-helix is present in the CHARMM 36 ensemble, which is inconsistent with measured scalar couplings.
To eliminate inadequate sampling as a reason for diﬀerences between force ﬁelds, extensive simulations were carried out (0.964
ms in total); the remaining small sampling uncertainty is shown to be much smaller than the observed diﬀerences. Our ﬁndings
highlight how IDPs, with their rugged energy landscapes, are highly sensitive test systems that are capable of revealing force ﬁeld
deﬁciencies and, therefore, contributing to force ﬁeld development.
■INTRODUCTION
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) carry out crucial
biological functions in all kingdoms of life.1 The human
proteome is estimated to contain approximately a million
disordered motifs, which often act as signals in cellular
pathways, including protein degradation, traﬃcking, and
targeting.2 IDP aggregation is involved in diverse cellular
functions including the selective passage of material through
the nuclear pore complex3 and the segregation of materials in
membrane-less organelles via intracellular phase separation.4,5 A
fundamental understanding of the structural properties of IDPs
is crucial to understanding the wide range of cellular functions
relying on protein disorder.
An IDP by deﬁnition cannot be described by a single average
structure but instead must be described as an ensemble of
interconverting conformations. Obtaining accurate structural
ensembles of IDPs is the aim of many recent studies, both
experimental and computational.6,7 The protein ensemble
database (pE-DB),8 which is analogous to the PDB for
structures of folded proteins, contains a growing collection of
IDP ensembles. On the experimental side, nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and
single-molecule spectroscopy have emerged as highly useful and
complementary methods for obtaining structural information.6,9
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), ﬂuorescence
correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and SAXS provide measurements of overall chain dimensions. NMR spectroscopy provides
site-speciﬁc information, for example, on secondary structure
content and distances between labeled sites as well as
measurements of hydrodynamic radius using pulsed ﬁeld
gradient NMR (PFG-NMR).10
On the theory side, a variety of computational methods have
been developed to obtain structural ensembles of IDPs. These

methods can be broadly classiﬁed into two types: (1) those that
use experimental data to guide ensemble generation or
selection, and (2) those that generate ensembles of IDPs de
novo, that is, without using experimental data as an input.
An example of the ﬁrst type of method is the use of
experimental data as restraints in simulations. For instance,
NMR chemical shift restraints and distance restraints based on
paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) measurements
were used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the
denatured state of ACBP and α-synuclein, respectively.11−13
Other computational methods, such as ENSEMBLE14 and
ASTEROIDS,15 use experimental data to select ensembles from
pregenerated pools of conformations. Ensembles consistent
with experimental data have also been selected from
conformations obtained using MD simulations.16−18 Ball et al.
compared knowledge-based ensemble selection approaches to
ensembles obtained using de novo MD simulations.17 Because
IDP ensembles are severely underdetermined (that is, there are
many degrees of freedom and relatively few experimental
observables), cross-validation and care in avoiding overﬁtting
are essential to these approaches.16,19,20
Computational methods of the second type have been used
extensively to obtain ensembles of IDPs de novo. A variety of
simulation methods (MD, Monte Carlo, metadynamics, replica
exchange) and diﬀerent levels of representation (coarsegrained, implicit solvent, all-atom with explicit water) have
been used to obtain IDP ensembles.7,21−29 There are two main
challenges encountered in de novo simulations. First, extensive
simulations are needed to ensure that relevant regions of
conformational space are adequately sampled. Although this
requirement applies to all biomolecular simulations, it presents
a particularly formidable challenge in the case of IDPs due to
their high conformational heterogeneity. Second, and more
importantly, the accuracy of modern force ﬁelds for IDP
simulations is not well-characterized.
MD simulations have been used to study the structure and
dynamics of folded proteins for decades.30 During this time,
substantial eﬀort has been put into the development and
improvement of empirical force ﬁelds. The accuracy of the
description of the structure and dynamics of globular proteins,
as well as that of the relative stabilities of diﬀerent types of
secondary structure, were improved in the CHARMM and
Amber force ﬁelds.31−34 Systematic force ﬁeld comparison
studies have shown that, overall, force ﬁeld modiﬁcations
indeed tend to be improvements: simulations with more
recently developed force ﬁelds produce more accurate
ensembles of globular proteins compared to the older force
ﬁelds on which they are based.35,36
Some modern force ﬁelds describe small, globular proteins
quite well: NMR observables computed from these ensembles
agree with experimental values within the error expected for the
calculation of these observables.36,37 In a recent comparison of
force ﬁelds for folded proteins, Amber ﬀ99sb*-ildn and
CHARMM22* were the only two force ﬁelds consistent with
experimental data.35 In contrast, force ﬁelds have been shown
to diﬀer signiﬁcantly in their ability to fold proteins,38 especially
in the challenging task of folding proteins from multiple
structural classes.35 A study of villin headpiece aggregation
using diﬀerent force ﬁelds and solution conditions suggested
that protein−protein interactions generally tend to be overestimated: all of the force ﬁelds in this study showed
aggregation and are therefore inconsistent with experimental
evidence indicating no aggregation.39
Many force ﬁeld modiﬁcations have been directed at
improving the accuracy of conformational ensembles of
globular proteins. In contrast, most force ﬁelds have not been
developed for simulations of IDPs. Several recent force ﬁeld
modiﬁcations have improved the balance of secondary structure
propensities to be able to fold proteins of multiple structural
classes. It would in fact be somewhat surprising if accurate IDP
ensembles could be obtained using a force ﬁeld optimized only
for folded proteins. Nevertheless, all-atom simulations are
increasingly being used to obtain ensembles of IDPs (see recent
studies 23, 24, and 40−43).
It is diﬃcult to draw conclusions on the accuracy of IDP
simulations from the contradictory ﬁndings reported so far. On
the one hand, good agreement between computed and
measured experimental observables was observed in some
IDP simulations.23−25,27,28,42,44−46 On the other hand, the
accuracy of unfolded state and IDP structural ensembles
obtained using several widely used force ﬁelds has been called
into question.25−27,43,46−53 Piana et al. suggested that modern
force ﬁelds, including Amber ﬀ99sb*-ildn and CHARMM 22*
in particular, produce IDP and unfolded state ensembles that
are on average too compact.48 It has also been suggested that
Amber force ﬁelds systematically underestimate chain dimensions of IDPs and unfolded states.51 To address these force
ﬁeld deﬁciencies, a new water model, TIP4P-D,26 and new
force ﬁeld, Amber 03ws,51 were recently introduced.
While these recent studies demonstrate a substantial interest
in obtaining accurate ensembles of IDPs using all-atom
simulations, there is currently no consensus on the most
accurate force ﬁeld or the suitability of any force ﬁeld for this
purpose. Information on the accuracy of IDP ensembles is
sparse, anecdotal, and contradictory, which may be due a
combination of multiple factors: (1) inadequate conformational
sampling of IDP ensembles, (2) comparisons to models derived
from primary experimental data rather than the primary data
itself, and (3) comparisons to relatively few (and sometimes
only one) observables. In the absence of a comprehensive
comparison, it is not surprising that a consensus is currently
lacking concerning the accuracy of IDP simulations.
Here, we aim to evaluate the accuracy of IDP ensembles
obtained using de novo molecular simulations. Toward this
aim, we compared ensembles obtained using eight all-atom
empirical force ﬁelds (Table 1) to primary SAXS and NMR
data. For reasons of computational feasibility, we included only
eight force ﬁelds. We addressed the sampling problem using
temperature replica exchange54 as well as extensive sampling,
accumulating a total sampling time of 964 μs (a detailed list of
simulations is provided in Table S1).

For such a comparative study, the choice of model system is
crucial. The model system must be small enough to make it
possible to obtain adequate sampling for each force ﬁeld. In
addition, and more importantly, experimental data characterizing both local and global structural properties are needed. We
chose a set of sequences that cover a broad spectrum of
sequence properties from highly charged in the case of a
disordered arginine/serine (RS) peptide to uncharged and
enriched in polar and hydrophobic residues in the case of FGnucleoporin peptides.
The RS peptide is a well-suited IDP for this comparison, it
has previously been extensively characterized by multiple NMR
experiments by Xiang et al.16 as well as by SAXS experiments in
this work. Its small size (24 residues) makes it feasible to
perform extensive simulations using multiple force ﬁelds with
current computational capabilities. The RS peptide undergoes a
phosphorylation-induced reduction in conformational entropy,
which is thought to be important in modulating protein-RNA
interactions.16 Here, we carried out simulations of only the
unphosphorylated form. Two FG-nucleoporin peptides with
sequences based on the sequence of yeast Nsp1p59 were also
studied. These peptides diﬀer in length (16 residues and 50
residues). FG-nucleoporins are a well-studied class of IDPs that
are characterized by the presence of FG motifs and are essential
for the selectivity of the nuclear pore complex.60 We also
studied (AAQAA)3 and the HEWL peptide, which is a 19residue sequence derived from hen egg white lysozyme.58
Simulations. The RS peptide was built in a fully extended
conﬁguration in PYMOL with protonation states to match
experimental conditions (arginine residues as well as the N- and
C-termini were simulated in their charged states). The
simulation system consisted of the peptide in a rhombic
dodecahedral box with water molecules and 0.15 M NaCl for a
total of ∼42000 atoms. GROMACS version 4.5.461 was used
for all simulations. Prior to the production runs, energy
minimization with the steepest descent algorithm was
performed. The lengths of bonds with hydrogen atoms were
constrained using the LINCS algorithm.62 An integration time
step of 2 fs was used. A cutoﬀof 0.95 nm was used for the
Lennard-Jones interactions and short-range electrostatic
interactions. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated by particle-mesh Ewald summation with a grid spacing of
0.12 nm and a fourth order interpolation.63 The velocity
rescaling thermostat was used for all simulations.64 Equilibration was performed at 298 K for 1 ns using Berendsen pressure
coupling65 followed by 5 ns of simulation in the NPT ensemble
using the Parrinello−Rahman algorithm.66 The conﬁguration
from this simulation with a volume closest to the average
volume was then used for subsequent replica exchange (RE)54
simulations in the canonical ensemble. A total of 97
temperatures between 298 and 450 K were used with a mean
acceptance ratio of 0.35. Temperature exchanges were
attempted every 2 ps for a total of 97 μs (1 μs of simulation
per temperature). Coordinates were stored before each
temperature exchange; a total of 0.5 × 106 conﬁgurations
were collected per temperature. Simulations with the TIP4P-D
water model26 were carried out without replica exchange,
consistent with Piana et al.,26 as conformational sampling in this
force ﬁeld is fast, and RE was not needed to obtain suﬃcient
sampling, comparable to the other force ﬁelds. Simulations with
the ABSINTH21 implicit solvent model were carried out with
the CAMPARI software following a similar protocol to Das and
Pappu.67 The CAMPARI parameter set abs3.2_opls.prm was
used for the peptide, and the ion parameters of Mao and Pappu
were used.68 In Table S2, we provide the details of the Monte
Carlo move set used. Visual molecular dynamics (VMD) was
used for all molecular visualizations.69
Analysis of Structural Ensembles. The GROMACS
utilities g_gyrate and g_hbond were used to calculate the
radius of gyration, Rg, and number of hydrogen bonds,
respectively. Secondary structure was assigned according to
the DSSP algorithm.70 Contacts between residue pairs were
deﬁned if any two atoms were within a cutoﬀof 4.5 Å. Left
handed α-helix was deﬁned as three or more consecutive
residues in the αL basin of the Ramachandran plot. Standard
error of the mean was computed using a blocking procedure.71
For each simulation, an equilibration period was delineated on
the basis of both Rg and hydrogen bonds; this initial collapse of
the peptide to more compact conformations was excluded from
Computing Experimental Observables. SAXS scattering
curves were computed individually for every conformation in
each ensemble using two diﬀerent approaches, CRYSOL72 and
FOXS.73 Ensemble-averaged scattering curves were computed
for each force ﬁeld. Each of these curves were ﬁt to the
experimental curve following the ﬁtting procedure used by
Chen et al.74 The software PRIMUS75 was used to compute the
Rg from each scattering curve using Guinier analysis. The
hydrodynamic radius, Rh, was computed for each conﬁguration
using HYDROPRO76 with the parameters of Mao et al.45
Comparison is made to the hydrodynamic radius measured
using pulse-ﬁeld-gradient NMR by Xiang et al.16 The Karplus
equation parameters used to calculate scalar couplings are given
in Table S3.77−81 RMS errors for the calculation of J couplings
are 0.73 Hz (3JHNHα), 0.5 Hz (1JCαCβ), 2 Hz (1JCαHα), 0.38 Hz
(3JNCγ and 3JCCγ).77−81 Chemical shifts were calculated using
both SHIFTX282 and SPARTA+.83 The reported errors for
SHIFTX2 are the lowest of any chemical shift predictor (0.4412
ppm for Cα and 0.5330 ppm for C′).82 The RMS errors for
SPARTA+ are 0.94 ppm for Cα and 1.09 ppm for C′.83 The
errors may be higher when applied to IDPs. All of the
computed NMR observables are compared to those reported
by Xiang et al. for the unphosphorylated RS peptide.16
Experimental Methods. Small angle scattering data was
gathered on the X33 beamline at the EMBL Outstation using
the DORIS synchrotron source located in DESY, Hamburg.84
Samples at concentrations of 2 and 0.33 mg/mL or 0.67 mL in
buﬀer at 25 °C were loaded into sample cell using X33
automated sample changer85 and exposed for four frames, 30 s
each. The buﬀer was 50 mM Na-phosphate buﬀer, 100 mM
NaCl, and pH 7.0, which was also used for all RS peptide NMR
experiments. Data was recorded on a Pilatus 1 M photon
counting detector. After comparing frames for radiation
damage, each frame was radially averaged and then 1d-averaged
using the AutoPilatus software. I(0) and Rg analysis was done
manually to ensure quality in the presence of high noise, using
the PRIMUS program, and veriﬁed by visual checking of used
data ranges.75,86
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Chain Dimensions Depend Strongly on Force Field.
Conformational ensembles of the RS peptide were obtained
using eight diﬀerent force ﬁelds (Table 1). As can be seen in
Figure 1, peptide chain dimensions depend strongly on the

force ﬁeld. This dependence is evident in both the radius of
gyration, Rg (Figure 1A), and mean separation distance
between residue pairs (Figure 1B). The ensemble obtained
with Amber ﬀ99sb*-ildn is the most compact, resembling a
collapsed globule-like ensemble. The most expanded ensemble
is obtained with Amber ﬀ03ws. The other six force ﬁelds
generated a broad spectrum of chain dimensions that fall
between these two extreme cases. For illustrating these
diﬀerences, a selection of structures from each force ﬁeld are
shown in Figure S1. The small statistical uncertainties reported
for each structural property and each force ﬁeld in Figure 1
indicate that suﬃcient sampling of conformational space was
obtained. This is further conﬁrmed by analysis of the contact
maps in the ﬁrst and second halves of the simulations, which
are remarkably similar (Figure S2), indicating that the
conformational ensembles are well-sampled in all cases. The
observed diﬀerences therefore must be attributed to inherent
force ﬁeld diﬀerences and not to inadequate conformational
We also assessed the eﬀect of the chosen water model. For
three of the force ﬁelds, we have therefore kept the same force
ﬁeld for the peptide and used two diﬀerent water models. In
each of these cases, the diﬀerence in water model has a
signiﬁcant eﬀect on chain compactness (Figure 1A and B).
With CHARMM 22*, the TIP4P-D water model produces a
more expanded ensemble than charmm-modiﬁed TIP3P. The
relative expansion of the ensemble in TIP4P-D compared to
charmm-modiﬁed TIP3P is consistent with results reported for
other IDPs.26 Amber ﬀ03ws produces a more expanded
ensemble than Amber ﬀ03w; this is also to be expected given
that the depth of the Lennard-Jones potential, ε, between
protein atoms and water oxygen atoms is scaled by a factor of
1.1 in Amber ﬀ03ws compared to ﬀ03w.51 With CHARMM 36,
charmm-modiﬁed TIP3P produces a signiﬁcantly more
expanded ensemble than TIP3P. Both of these water models
were included in the development of CHARMM 36;58 here,
they lead to signiﬁcant diﬀerences in compactness. Because of
the strong dependence of chain dimensions on the water
model, no simple grouping of Amber- and CHARMM-based
force ﬁelds with respect to compactness is evident.
The diﬀerences in chain dimensions correlate with marked
diﬀerences in the balance between chain−chain and chain-water
interactions (Figure 1C and D). Conformations in the
CHARMM 361 ensemble have, on average, the highest number
of intrapeptide hydrogen bonds. Conformations in the Amber
ﬀ99sb*-ildn ensemble have, on average, the fewest hydrogen
bonds to water molecules. Intrachain contacts in this ensemble
are formed between residues close in sequence (turns) as well
as long-range contacts (Figure 2A and Figure S3), consistent
with the behavior of a collapsed globule. The ensembles
obtained using the other force ﬁelds have intrapeptide
hydrogen bonds that occur primarily in the form of local
turns and helices with relatively few nonlocal contacts (Figure
2A and Figure S3).
Comparing the chain dimensions (Figure 1A and B) of
ensembles obtained using diﬀerent force ﬁelds to hydrogen
bonding (Figure 1C and D), it can be seen that these structural
properties are not perfectly correlated. Speciﬁcally, ensembles
with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent structural properties may have the
same mean dimensions. For instance, the chain dimensions
CHARMM 22*/TIP4P-D ensemble are nearly the same as
those of the ABSINTH ensemble (Figure 1B), but the
ensemble with ABSINTH has a signiﬁcantly higher population
of intrapeptide hydrogen bonds (Figures 1C and 2A). The

respectively. (B) Ensemble-averaged distance, <Rij>, between the α-carbon atoms of residue pairs, i and j, vs sequence separation, |i −j|. (C)

ABSINTH implicit solvent ensemble is unique in another
respect: the low Rg peak (centered at 9 Å, Figure 1A) is due to
the presence of an arginine claw-type structure (a representative conformation is provided in Figure S4; low Rg (<9.6 Å)
conformations were observed in every replica exchange run
carried out with ABSINTH). This conformation is reminiscent
of the arginine claw observed previously in implicit solvent
simulations of a phosphorylated RS peptide in which the
phosphoserine residues were pointing outward into the
solvent.87,88 The claw-like conformation in the ABSINTH
ensemble is actually an inverse arginine claw in which the
arginine residues point outward and the serine residues point
Secondary Structure Content Depends Strongly on
Force Field. Like chain dimensions and hydrogen bonding,
secondary structure content also depends strongly on the force
ﬁeld for both the RS peptide (Figure 2B) and the FGnucleoporin peptide (Figure S5). We compared the secondary
structure content of ensembles obtained using diﬀerent force
ﬁelds for the same peptide sequence. The RMS diﬀerence in
secondary structure content between ensembles with the same
sequence and diﬀerent force ﬁelds was calculated to be 0.1. We
also compared the ensembles of the RS peptide and FGnucleoporin peptide obtained using the same force ﬁeld. The
RMS diﬀerence in secondary structure content between
ensembles obtained using the same force ﬁeld and diﬀerent
sequences was calculated to be 0.06. Overall, we ﬁnd that a
change in force ﬁeld has a stronger eﬀect on secondary
structure content than changing the entire peptide sequence.
For the two peptides compared here, the change in sequence is
quite large. The RS peptide is highly charged, whereas the FG
peptide is composed entirely of polar and hydrophobic
residues. This result demonstrates how dramatically sensitive
IDPs are to force ﬁeld selection. Their rugged energy
landscapes with many iso-energetic minima separated by low
barriers make IDPs highly sensitive test systems to assess force
ﬁeld accuracy.

Ensembles Obtained Using CHARMM 36 Have a Bias
toward a Left-Handed α-Helix. As can be seen in Figure 2B,
the ensembles in most force ﬁelds have substantial content of
bends and turns and relatively low α-helix and β-sheet content.
There are two notable exceptions: CHARMM 36 with TIP3P
and charmm-modiﬁed TIP3P; both of these ensembles have an
exceptionally high α-helix content. Unexpectedly, this helix
does not have the usual handedness expected for proteins; it is
left-handed (a representative structure is shown in Figure 2C).
Left-handed α-helices are exceedingly rare in structured
proteins. Only 31 left-handed α-helices were found in a survey
of 7984 structures from the PDB, and only 10 contained no
glycines.89 The maximum length of any of these was 6 residues;
these helices are actually single helical turns, rather than
extended helices. Longer left-handed α-helices, such as those
seen in the ensembles with CHARMM 36, are essentially
absent from structured proteins, based on known protein
structures in the PDB.
Figure 3 compares the Ramachandran maps of all eight force
ﬁelds to that of nonproline, nonglycine coil residues in the
Top50090 set of proteins (a nonredundant set of protein
structures from the PDB). The population in the αL basin in
the Top500 coil set is low (6%). Consistent with this
population, most of the force ﬁelds also have low populations
in αL, except for the CHARMM 36 ensembles, both of which
have populations of more than 40%. No other force ﬁeld has
such a strong αL bias. In fact, more than 85% of the
conformations in the CHARMM 36 ensemble contain a lefthanded α-helix. Ramachandran maps of ensembles obtained
using the same force ﬁeld for the peptide, but which diﬀer in
water model used, are very similar (Figure 3). This result
provides further independent support that suﬃcient conformational sampling has been achieved.
Structural Ensembles Obtained Using Diﬀerent Force
Fields Exhibit High Variability. Taken together, the results
presented so far indicate the strong dependence of secondary
structure and compactness on the choice of force ﬁeld. For
example, the ensemble in Amber ﬀ99sb*-ildn has nearly four
times as many intrapeptide hydrogen bonds compared to the
Amber ﬀ03ws ensemble. The choice of water model also has a
signiﬁcant eﬀect on compactness, consistent with other
studies.26,51 The ensembles with CHARMM 36 are unique in
their exceptionally high left-handed α-helix population.
Although it is to be expected that the conformational ensemble
of an IDP will depend, to some extent, on the chosen force
ﬁeld, the magnitude of the diﬀerence between force ﬁelds seen
for the RS peptide is remarkable, spanning a range from
globular to highly expanded. This ﬁnding is particularly
surprising in light of the fact that many of these force ﬁelds
have performed well in other benchmark studies.26,35,51
Therefore, we next asked how well these ensembles compare
to a diverse set of experimental data.
Assessing the Accuracy of Chain Dimensions:
Comparison to Primary Experimental Data. For this
aim, we measured SAXS data for the RS peptide, as described in
the Experimental Methods. Figure 4a shows the measured
SAXS scattering curve, along with the scattering curve
calculated from the MD simulations using each force ﬁeld.
The curves of two ensembles, those obtained using CHARMM
22* and Amber ﬀ03w, agree within error with the experimental
data. The mean Rg and RH of each ensemble are shown in
Figure 4B and C, respectively. The mean Rg of the CHARMM
22* ensemble (12.65 ± 0.07 Å) is slightly smaller than that of
the Amber ﬀ03w ensemble (13.3 ± 0.1 Å) and agrees best with
the measured Rg (12.62 ± 0.07 Å). These results are similar for
both approaches to computing scattering curves from structures
(results for both CRYSOL and FOXS are shown in Figure S8
and S9). Consistent with the results for radius of gyration, the
CHARMM 22* ensemble is in closest agreement with the
experimental hydrodynamic radius (11.95 ± 0.01 Å compared
to the experimentally measured value of 11.9 ± 0.1 Å).
Figure 3. Force ﬁeld diﬀerences in backbone dihedral angles. The potential of mean force (PMF), −log(P(φ,ψ)), with color scale in kT, is shown for
each force ﬁeld. The upper right graph (PDB, coil) corresponds to all non-Pro, non-Gly residues that are not in helix or sheet secondary structure in

CHARMM 36 (with TIP3P) = 0.42, CHARMM 36 (with charmm-modiﬁed TIP3P) = 0.41, and PDB, coil = 0.06. More than 85% of conformations
in the CHARMM 36 ensemble contain left-handed α-helix. Refer to Figures S6 and S7 for the same analysis for arginine and serine residues

The collapsed globule ensemble of Amber ﬀ99sb*-ildn and
the predominantly left-handed α-helix ensemble of CHARMM
36 are both too compact and inconsistent with the SAXS and
PFG-NMR data. These results suggest that chain-chain
interactions are too favorable compared to chain-water
interactions in these force ﬁelds, or, alternatively, that the
hydrophobic eﬀect is too strong. A combination of these eﬀects
is likely, but our results do not allow us to assess the relative
contributions of these eﬀects.
In contrast, ABSINTH, Amber ﬀ03ws, and CHARMM 22*
with the TIP4P-D water model generate ensembles that are too
expanded compared to the experimental Rg and RH, suggesting
that the balance is shifted too far in favor of chain-water
interactions in these force ﬁelds. The implicit solvent model,
ABSINTH, has previously been found to agree with measurements of RH for other IDPs.45 Amber ﬀ03ws and CHARMM
22* with TIP4P-D were both developed with the speciﬁc aim
of matching the experimental chain dimensions of IDPs.26,51
The TIP4P-D water model has a Lennard-Jones C6 parameter
50% larger than that of other water models and thus has
increased dispersion interactions.26 The fact that these force
ﬁelds result in ensembles that are too expanded in comparison
to experimental data for the RS peptide suggests that the
problem of obtaining an accurate force ﬁeld for IDPs may not
be solved simply by modiﬁed water models parametrized
speciﬁcally for IDPs.
Assessing the Accuracy of Secondary Structure
Content: Comparison to
3JHNHα Couplings. The
CHARMM 22* and Amber ﬀ03w ensembles agree well with
SAXS and PFG-NMR data. These two ensembles are similar in
compactness (Figure 1), but they diﬀer signiﬁcantly in
secondary structure content (Figure 2). To assess the accuracy
of secondary structure content, we compare to measured scalar
couplings, which report on ensemble-averaged backbone and
side chain dihedral angles. Figure 5 shows
3JHNHα scalar
couplings, which report on the φ backbone dihedral angle and
are the most-informative (and most-commonly used) for
backbone conformation.91 As can be seen, two force ﬁelds
agree well with the measured couplings, CHARMM 22* with
charmm-modiﬁed TIP3P and TIP4P-D water models. The
3JHNHα scalar couplings for both CHARMM 36 ensembles are
outside of experimental error. Because these couplings report
on the φ dihedral angle, this ﬁnding also implies that the high
left-handed α-helix population in CHARMM 36 is not
consistent with the experimental data. For all three force ﬁelds

PFG-NMR. (A) Shown are ensemble-averaged scattering curves for
each force ﬁeld (with the same color scheme as Figure 1). The
experimental curve is shown with error in gray. The ensembles in two
force ﬁelds agree with the experimental scattering curve within error:
Amber ﬀ03w and CHARMM 22*. (B) The radius of gyration is shown
for each force ﬁeld and the experimental data (black). (C) The
hydrodynamic radius is shown for each force ﬁeld, and the
experimentally measured value is shown in black. The shaded gray
lines in (B) and (C) indicate the experimental error.
Figure 5. Comparison to measured 3JHN‑Hα couplings. (A) The 3JHN‑Hα
couplings are shown for the ensemble obtained using each force ﬁeld
(the color scheme is consistent with Figures 1 and 4, shading indicates
statistical uncertainty, which is on the order of the line thickness,
∼0.01 Hz). The experimental
3JHN‑Hα couplings (with error) are
shown in gray shading; arginine and serine residues in the RS repeats
have one measured 3JHN‑Hα coupling. A correction to the 3JHNHα scalar
couplings has been suggested in the literature.92 Such a correction
would shift the true values of the scalar couplings to higher values
compared to the experimentally measured values.77 This additional
uncertainty in the experimental values (estimated to be up to 5%17) is
indicated in lighter gray. (B) The average unsigned error for the
ensemble obtained using each force ﬁeld is shown.

for which diﬀerent water models are tested (CHARMM 22*,
Amber ﬀ03w, and CHARMM 36), changing the water model
has a relatively small impact on the 3JHNHα scalar couplings.
Obviously, the water model has a negligible eﬀect on φ
backbone dihedral preferences, which can also be seen in the
Ramachandran plots in Figure 3.
Next, we compared the RS peptide ensembles to a large set
of scalar couplings and chemical shifts as summarized in Figure
6 (raw data for each observable is provided in Figures S10−
S18). Two more scalar couplings (1JCαCβ and 1JCαHα) report on
the φ backbone dihedral angle. However, these scalar couplings
are less informative than 3JHNHα. 1JCαCβ coupling constants have
been found to depend more on amino acid composition than
secondary structure preferences.79 Nevertheless, as seen with
the 3JHNHα scalar couplings, the ensembles with CHARMM 22*
are in closest agreement, and the CHARMM 36 ensembles do
not agree well for both 1JCαCβ and 1JCαHα. Comparison to side
chain scalar couplings are also reported (Figures S12 and S13).
The CHARMM 36 ensembles again show the largest errors,
whereas the average unsigned errors for the other force ﬁelds
are low (less than 0.4 Hz, the RMS prediction error). In
general, the comparison to the experimental scalar couplings is
limited primarily by the accuracy of computing scalar couplings
with Karplus relations. The typical statistical uncertainty in the
computed scalar couplings is only ∼0.01 Hz (smaller than the
line thickness in Figure 5) because of the extensive conformational sampling, which is much smaller than the RMS
prediction errors. Thus, the observed deviations do not
necessarily imply force ﬁeld artifacts.
With respect to scalar couplings, CHARMM 36 ensembles
deviate most from the experimental data, which is likely due to
the high left-handed α-helix population. To investigate this
further, we calculated the scalar couplings for a subensemble
that was generated by selecting all conformations in the
CHARMM 36 ensemble that contained no left-handed α-helix
(Figure S15). This subensemble has signiﬁcantly lower error
compared to the experimental backbone scalar couplings,
providing further evidence that the left-handed α-helix is
inconsistent with the experimental data.
Comparison to Chemical Shifts. Carbonyl carbon and αcarbon chemical shifts have also been measured for the RS
peptide.16 Both of these types of chemical shifts are very
sensitive to secondary structure.93 The comparison to these
chemical shifts is primarily limited by the expected accuracy of
currently available chemical shift predictors. Within the
expected error of SPARTA+, the chemical shifts of all of the
ensembles agree with the experimental shifts. Chemical shifts
calculated with SHIFTX2 have signiﬁcantly smaller reported
RMS errors than SPARTA+.82 We report chemical shifts
computed using both approaches as secondary chemical shifts
(with the random coil values subtracted) in Figures S16−S18.
Only the ensemble obtained with CHARMM 22* (and
charmm-modiﬁed TIP3P) agrees well with all available
experimental data, except for residual dipolar couplings
(RDCs). Consistent with earlier reports,17,94,95 we ﬁnd that
the ensembles in all force ﬁelds are in poor agreement with
RDCs (see Figure S19). It has been suggested that the
conformational ensembles of IDPs may be aﬀected by the
presence of alignment media used in measurements of RDCs.96
It is also well-established that IDPs are highly sensitive to
solution conditions.97,98 Therefore, it is still unclear from the
present set of evidence whether the disagreement with RDCs
comes from an eﬀect of the alignment media on the ensembles
or due to the force ﬁeld. We are therefore carrying out a more
detailed investigation into these eﬀects. This will be published
in a further study, as it goes signiﬁcantly beyond the scope of
the present work.
Generality and Causes of the Left-Handed Helix
Propensity of CHARMM 36. We next investigated whether
only the RS peptide forms a left-handed α-helix with
CHARMM 36, or whether this force ﬁeld has a general
propensity for αL. To this end, simulations with (A)3,
(AAQAA)3, and the HEWL peptide were performed. The
Ramachandran plots for (A)3 and (AAQAA)3 (Figure S20)
show a 6-fold lower αL propensity than seen for the RS peptide
and are consistent with those reported by Best et al.58 We also
carried out microsecond simulations of the HEWL peptide.
Approximately 30% of the ensemble of this peptide contains
left-handed α-helix (Figure S21). At least 200 ns of simulation
were needed before the left-handed helix formed, which is
longer than earlier simulations of this peptide.58 Thus, even
though these proteins do not fold, long simulation times may
be needed to ﬁnd all highly populated conformational states.
The 16-residue FG-nucleoporin peptide (Figure 7a), as well
as the longer 50-residue FG-nucleoporin peptide (Figure S22a),
also showed a high population in the αL basin for the
CHARMM 36 force ﬁeld. A conformation of the FGnucleoporin peptide containing helices of both handedness is
shown (Figure S22b). Thus, the bias of CHARMM 36 toward
left-handed α-helix is not limited to the RS peptide but rather
seems to be quite general. This leads directly to the question:
what causes the CHARMM 36 bias toward left-handed α-helix?
Left-handed α-helix is sterically disfavored by the close
proximity of the side chain Cβ atom with the carbonyl C′ atom
of the previous residue.99 Comparing CHARMM 36 to its
predecessor, CHARMM 22/CMAP, one of the modiﬁcations is
Figure 6. Comparison to NMR and SAXS experimental data:

a change in the Lennard-Jones parameters of aliphatic hydrogen
and carbon atoms, including the side chain Cβ atom.58,100 In
particular, the Lennard-Jones σ parameter was decreased.
Because it is precisely a steric clash between this atom and the
carbonyl C′ atom that precludes the αL conformation in nature,
we tested the eﬀect of using the aliphatic LJ parameters of the
CHARMM 22/CMAP force ﬁeld in CHARMM 36, which is
here referred to as CHARMM 36, LJ mod.
In Figure 7a, Ramachandran plots are shown for the FGnucleoporin peptide with CHARMM 36 as well as CHARMM
36, LJ mod. Indeed, the population in the αL basin is
signiﬁcantly reduced by this modiﬁcation. Furthermore, the
fraction of the ensemble containing left-handed α-helix is
reduced from over 40% with CHARMM 36 to below 15% with
CHARMM 36, LJ mod, which is even less left-handed α-helix
than the CHARMM 22/CMAP ensemble (Figure 7b). It is
therefore likely that a combination of a CMAP correction
rendering the αL basin too favorable, combined with a decrease
in the LJ σ parameter of the side chain Cβ atom, promotes αL
formation. The CHARMM 36 subensemble containing no left
handed α-helix has nearly the same radius of gyration as the
entire ensemble (Figure S23). This result suggests that further
modiﬁcations to the CHARMM 36 force ﬁeld would be needed
beyond adjusting the aliphatic LJ parameters; we did not pursue
this direction further.
■CONCLUSIONS
Obtaining accurate descriptions of IDPs by means of MD
simulations is quite challenging both due to their sensitivity to
force ﬁeld inaccuracies as well as the need for extensive
sampling. In addition, it is more demanding to obtain
experimental information characterizing the entire ensemble
of an IDP than the average structure of a folded protein because
more experimental information is needed in the case of IDPs
due to their high conformational heterogeneity. Furthermore,
most experimental measurements obtained for IDPs are
ensemble-averages, which only increases the challenge faced
in characterizing IDPs.
Here, we assessed the accuracy of ensembles obtained from
de novo simulations without the use of experimental
information to guide ensemble selection or generation.
Experimental data from SAXS and NMR were then used to
evaluate the accuracy of the ensembles obtained using eight
state-of-the-art force ﬁelds. Note that this study is not a
comprehensive test of all available force ﬁeld combinations.
Suﬃcient conformational sampling was obtained using replica
exchange. Taken together, our results demonstrate an
unexpectedly high sensitivity of IDP conformational ensembles
to diﬀerences between the force ﬁelds. For example, for
CHARMM 36, an unexpectedly high propensity for left-handed
α-helix was found, which was strongly reduced by relatively
small changes in the Lennard-Jones parameters of aliphatic
carbons. A comparison of the secondary structure content of
the RS and FG peptides showed that, for these two very
diﬀerent IDPs, force ﬁeld is a stronger determinant of
secondary structure content than peptide sequence. Major
diﬀerences in chain dimensions were also found: ensembles
span the entire range from collapsed globule-like to highly
expanded. There was consensus, though, among all of the force
ﬁelds that the studied peptides are disordered (that is,
populating many conformations rather than a single, welldeﬁned native structure). Even this similarity is tenuous
because the vast majority of the CHARMM 36 ensemble
contains stretches of left-handed α-helix.
A key ﬁnding of this study is that the conformational
ensemble obtained using CHARMM 22* with charmmmodiﬁed TIP3P agrees best with all available experimental
data. Maintaining the correct balance between solvent−solvent,
solvent−solute, and solute−solute interactions has been an
optimization criterion in the development of the CHARMM
force ﬁelds, even in much earlier versions.31,101 With a correct
balance of interactions, the quality of water as a solvent for
proteins should be well described, and this indeed appears to be
the case for the RS peptide.
This study provides a systematic benchmark of eight force
ﬁelds for a set of IDPs. Further computational-experimental
studies of other IDPs are a necessary next step to delineate the
accuracy of force ﬁelds for simulations of IDPs of diﬀerent
length and sequence composition.
