SYNTHESIS LECTURES ON HUMAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES #16
Sentiment analysis and opinion mining is the ﬁeld of study that analyzes people’s opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions from written language. It is one of the most active research areas in natural language processing and is also widely studied in data mining, Web mining,
and text mining. In fact, this research has spread outside of computer science to the management
sciences and social sciences due to its importance to business and society as a whole. The growing
importance of sentiment analysis coincides with the growth of social media such as reviews, forum
discussions, blogs, micro-blogs, Twitter, and social networks. For the ﬁrst time in human history, we
now have a huge volume of opinionated data recorded in digital form for analysis.
Sentiment analysis systems are being applied in almost every business and social domain
because opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key inﬂuencers of our behaviors.
Our beliefs and perceptions of reality, and the choices we make, are largely conditioned on how others see and evaluate the world. For this reason, when we need to make a decision we often seek out
the opinions of others. This is true not only for individuals but also for organizations.
This book is a comprehensive introductory and survey text. It covers all important topics and
the latest developments in the ﬁeld with over 400 references. It is suitable for students, researchers and practitioners who are interested in social media analysis in general and sentiment analysis
in particular. Lecturers can readily use it in class for courses on natural language processing, social
media analysis, text mining, and data mining. Lecture slides are also available online.

Opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key inﬂuencers of our behaviors. Our
beliefs and perceptions of reality, and the choices we make, are, to a considerable degree, conditioned upon how others see and evaluate the world. For this reason, when we need to make a decision we often seek out the opinions of others. This is not only true for individuals but also true for
organizations.
Opinions and related concepts such as sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions are
the subjects of study of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. The inception and rapid growth of
the ﬁeld coincide with those of the social media on the Web, e.g., reviews, forum discussions, blogs,
micro-blogs, Twitter, and social networks, because for the ﬁrst time in human history, we have a
huge volume of opinionated data recorded in digital forms. Since early 2000, sentiment analysis
has grown to be one of the most active research areas in natural language processing. It is also
widely studied in data mining, Web mining, and text mining. In fact, it has spread from computer
science to management sciences and social sciences due to its importance to business and society
as a whole. In recent years, industrial activities surrounding sentiment analysis have also thrived.
Numerous startups have emerged. Many large corporations have built their own in-house capabilities. Sentiment analysis systems have found their applications in almost every business and social
The goal of this book is to give an in-depth introduction to this fascinating problem and to
present a comprehensive survey of all important research topics and the latest developments in
the ﬁeld. As evidence of that, this book covers more than 400 references from all major conferences and journals. Although the ﬁeld deals with the natural language text, which is often
considered the unstructured data, this book takes a structured approach in introducing the problem
with the aim of bridging the unstructured and structured worlds and facilitating qualitative and
quantitative analysis of opinions. This is crucial for practical applications. In this book, I ﬁrst deﬁne
the problem in order to provide an abstraction or structure to the problem. From the abstraction,
we will naturally see its key sub-problems. The subsequent chapters discuss the existing techniques
for solving these sub-problems.
This book is suitable for students, researchers, and practitioners who are interested in social
media analysis in general and sentiment analysis in particular. Lecturers can readily use it in class for
courses on natural language processing, social media analysis, text mining, and data mining. Lecture
slides are also available online.
