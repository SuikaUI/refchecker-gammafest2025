Abstract The analysis of R ×C contingency tables usually
features a test for independence between row and column
counts. Throughout the social sciences, the adequacy of
the independence hypothesis is generally evaluated by the
outcome of a classical p-value null-hypothesis significance
test. Unfortunately, however, the classical p-value comes
with a number of well-documented drawbacks. Here we
outline an alternative, Bayes factor method to quantify the
evidence for and against the hypothesis of independence
in R × C contingency tables. First we describe different
sampling models for contingency tables and provide the corresponding default Bayes factors as originally developed by
Gunel and Dickey (Biometrika, 61(3):545–557 ). We
then illustrate the properties and advantages of a Bayes factor analysis of contingency tables through simulations and
practical examples. Computer code is available online and
has been incorporated in the “BayesFactor” R package and
the JASP program (jasp-stats.org).

categorical variables. In a contingency table, the intersection
of row and column categories are known as cells. If y∗∗is a
matrix of counts with R rows and C columns then the cell
entry yrc corresponds to the intersection of the rth row with
the cth column. For concreteness, consider Experiment 2
from the famous set of three experiments by Dutton and
Aron , designed to “test the notion that an attractive
female is seen as more attractive by males who encounter
her while they experience a strong emotion (fear) than by
males not experiencing a strong emotion.” . The experimental scenario involved a attractive female interviewer who contacted male participants to
fill out a short questionnaire. To manipulate fear, a subset
of participants filled out the questionnaire while balancing on a fear-arousing suspension bridge (i.e., the Capilano
Canyon Suspension Bridge: five-foot wide, swaying, with
low hand rails and a 230-foot drop to rocks below); the
remaining subset of participants filled out the questionnaire
while standing on a solid wood bridge with high handrails,
positioned only 10 feet above a small stream. To measure
experienced attractiveness, one of the key dependent measures was whether or not the participants later called the
female interviewer (they had been given her phone number
after completing the questionnaire).1 Table 1 summarizes
the results of the study in a 2×2 contingency table with fear
and attraction as categorical variables with two levels each.
The hypothesis from Dutton and Aron entails that
the outcomes for the two categorical variables are dependent: knowing whether a participant is in the fear-arousing
condition should affect the probability that he later decides
to call the interviewer.
1Not all participants accepted the phone number. The analysis here
focuses only on those participants that accepted the number.

Data from Dutton and Aron , Experiment 1
The top left cell entry of Table 1, y11 = 9, indicates
that 9 men were interviewed on the suspension bridge and
later called the female interviewer; the bottom left cell entry,
y21 = 2, indicates that 2 men were interviewed on the solid
bridge and later called the interviewer. In the following we
use the dot notation to indicate summation; for example,
Table 1 shows that a grand total of y.. = 34 men participated, and that of these men y.1 = 9 + 2 = 11 called the
female interviewer, whereas y.2 = 9 + 14 = 23 did not.
Examination of all four cell frequencies in Table 1 suggests
that men were more likely to call after having been interviewed on the fear-arousing suspension bridge instead of on
a solid bridge. Hence, the two categorical variables do not
appear to be independent. Dutton and Aron 
conclude: “In the experimental group 9 out of 18 called, in
the control group 2 out of 16 called (χ2 = 5.7, p < .02).
Taken in conjunction with the sexual imagery data, this finding suggests that subjects in the experimental group were
more attracted to the interviewer.”
In order to test the hypothesis of independence in R × C
contingency tables, popular methods include the χ2 test, the
likelihood ratio test, and the Fisher exact test. All these tests
are classical or frequentist, and ultimately their inferential
purpose rests on the interpretation of a p-value. The Fisherian believes this p-value quantifies the evidence against the
null hypothesis, whereas the Neyman-Pearsonite believes it
warrants the decision to reject the null hypothesis whenever p < α, with α = .05 as the default value . Unfortunately,
all p-value inference is plagued by the same conceptual
and practical problems . For example, pvalues are sensitive to the intention with which the data
were collected ; p-values cannot be used to quantify support in favor of the null-hypothesis; and finally,
p-values are known to overestimate the evidence against the
null-hypothesis . The main goal of this article is
to outline an alternative, Bayes factor hypothesis test for the
R × C contingency table that can be used to complement or
replace the classical hypothesis tests based on p-values.
Bayes factors for contingency tables have a long history
 . However, most of this
work can be understood and used only by those with a high
level of statistically sophistication, a fetish for archaic notation, and a desire for programming and debugging. At any
rate, social scientists generally do not use Bayes factors for
the analysis of contingency tables, and we surmise that the
key reasons for this are twofold: (1) the Bayesian tests are
relatively inaccessible, and (2) their practical use has not
been appropriately emphasized.
The outline of this paper is as follows. The first section
briefly describes four different sampling plans for contingency tables. The second section introduces the Bayes factor
in general terms, and the third section gives the rationale
and equations for four Bayes factors developed by Gunel
and Dickey (henceforth GD74) for R × C contingency tables. The fourth section provides a simulation,
and the fifth section demonstrates the application of the
GD74 Bayes factors to a series of concrete examples. Following the discussion section, the Appendix provides code
that illustrates how the results from the examples can be
obtained from the BayesFactor package in R. The contingency table Bayes factors have also been incorporated in
JASP, a free and open-source software program for statistical analyses (jasp-stats.org); see Appendix for details.
We would like to stress that our main contribution in this
paper is not to propose new Bayes factors for contingency
tables. Instead, our contribution was to decipher and translate the original GD74 article, implement the result in a
popular software program, and demonstrate its added value
by means of practical application.
Four sampling plans
The methods developed for the Bayesian analysis of contingency tables depend on the informativeness of the design.2
For the case of the R × C contingency table, we follow
GD74 and distinguish between the following four designs:
Poisson, joint multinomial, independent multinomial, and
hypergeometric. Below we consider each in turn.
2In classical statistics also, different tests exist for the separate sampling plans . When the sample size is large the differences
become negligible.
Behav Res 49:
Poisson sampling scheme Each cell count is random, and
so is the grand total. Each of the cell counts is Poisson distributed. This design often occurs in purely observational
work. For instance, suppose one is interested in whether
cars come to a complete stop at an intersection (yes/no) as
a function of the driver’s gender (male/female). When the
sampling scheme is to measure all cars during one entire
day, there is no restriction on any cell count, nor on the grand
Joint multinomial sampling scheme This scheme is the
same as the Poisson scheme, except that the grand total (y..)
is now fixed; hence, for the 2 × 2 table one only needs
three cell counts to uniquely identify the fourth, and the cell
counts are distributed as a joint multinomial. For the car
example above, this scheme holds when the stopping rule is
“collect data from 100 cars and then stop”.
Independent
multinomial
scheme there are two restrictions, either on the row totals
or on the column totals. In other words, either all row margins or all column margins are fixed. Consequently, the cell
counts are multinomially distributed within each row or column. In experimental psychology, this is the most common
sampling scheme. For the car example, this scheme holds
when the stopping rule is “collect data from 50 male drivers
and 50 female drivers”. For the 2 × 2 table, two cell counts
(i.e., the number of men who come to complete stop, and
the number of women who come to a complete stop) suffice
to uniquely identify the remaining two.
Hypergeometric sampling scheme In this scheme both
row and column margins are fixed. For the 2 × 2 table, a
single cell count suffices to determine the remaining three
uniquely. The cell counts are said to be hypergeometrically distributed. Practical application of the hypergeometric sampling scheme is rare. For the 2 × 2 table, an infinite
number of examples can be constructed by classifying participants according to a median split on two continuous
variables. For example, suppose we have 100 participants,
with income and altruism as variables of interest. The first
median split creates a group of 50 rich participants and 50
poor participants; the second median split creates a group
of 50 altruistic participants and 50 egotistical participants.
Hence, all row and column margins are fixed, and a single
cell count suffices to uniquely identify the remaining three.
GD74 devised an ingenious scheme of successive conditionalization to obtain Bayes factors for each of the four
sample schemes separately. Before we describe their result
the next section provides a more general outline of the Bayes
factor and its advantages.
Bayes factor basics
Denote the observed data by y and two competing models
by M1 and M2. It follows from Bayes’ rule that the posterior model odds equals the prior model odds multiplied by
the Bayes factor :
Posterior odds
Prior odds
× p(y | M1)
Bayes factor
Hence the Bayes factor quantifies the change from prior
to posterior model odds that are brought about by the data.
In this sense, the Bayes factor grades the decisiveness of
the evidence that the data provide for the hypotheses under
consideration . The Bayes factor can also be
conceptualized as the ratio of marginal likelihoods of M1
versus M2 :
BF12 = p(y | M1)
 p(y | θ, M1) p(θ | M1) dθ
 p(y | γ, M2) p(γ | M2) dγ .
This equation shows that the relative support of the data for
M1 versus M2 depends on the ratio of the prior-weighted
average likelihood, that is, on the average adequacy of predictions made for data y. Models receive support when
they provide a good account of the observed data across
a relatively a large proportion of their parameter space. In
contrast, highly flexible models make many predictions,
and most of these will be very poor for data y; these
poor predictions drive down the average likelihood, thereby
implementing a penalty for complexity known as Occam’s
razor .
Note that throughout this article, the first BF subscript indicates the model that is in the numerator and the second
subscript indicates the model that is in the denominator;
hence, BF12 = 1/BF21.
The framework of Bayes factors is entirely general, and
applies regardless of whether M1 and M2 are nested (i.e.,
one is a restricted subset of the other, as is required for
p-value null-hypothesis significance testing) or structurally
different . By fully conditioning on the observed
data and by gauging strength of evidence based on predictive performance ,
Bayes factors overcome several key limitations of p-value
null-hypothesis significance testing. With Bayes factors, the
null-hypothesis does not enjoy a special status and is not
evaluated in isolation, but instead is always pitted against a
specific alternative. Moreover, the Bayes factor provides a

graded assessment of evidence and does not enforce or warrant an all or none decision in terms of “rejecting” or “failing
to reject” a specific hypothesis.
In terms of interpretation, BF12 = 6.5 means that the
data are 6.5 times more likely under M1 than under M2;
BF12 = 0.2 means that the data are 1/0.2 = 5 times more
likely under M2 than under M1. When we assume that the
competing models are equally likely a priori (i.e., when the
prior odds equal 1), the Bayes factor can be transformed to
a posterior probability by dividing the Bayes factor by the
Bayes factor plus 1; for example, under equal prior probability a Bayes factor of BF12 = 6.5 leads to a posterior
probability for M1 of 6.5/7.5 ≈0.87; a Bayes factor of
BF12 = 0.2 leads to a posterior probability for M1 of
0.2/1.2 ≈0.17.
Despite the inherently continuous nature of the Bayes
factor as a measure of evidential strength, Jeffreys 
proposed to categorize Bayes factors in discrete categories,
shown in Table 2. These categories facilitate communication and their main use is to prevent overly enthusiastic
interpretation of Bayes factors in the range from 1/3 −
3; nevertheless, the category structure is no more than a
descriptive simplification of a continuous, graded scale of
evidence.3
3The authors are divided on the merits of Jeffreys’ classification
scheme. Author RDM notes that the scheme introduces information
into the analysis that is not justified by Bayesian theory itself; what is
“strong” evidence is an extra-Bayesian consideration, and there is no
reason that 10 should be the criterion for “strong” evidence in all, or
even in most. As note, assessments of the
strength of evidence will often be contextual, and at any rate, probability theory itself provides the interpretation of the Bayes factor as the
change in model odds. The Bayes factor needs no further interpretation. Other authors of this manuscript, however, believe that Jeffreys’
scheme can serve as a helpful guide.
Bayes factors for four sampling models
In this section we provide the GD74 Bayes factors for tests
of row-column independence in contingency tables, separately for each of the four sampling schemes. All Bayes
factor tests are based on a comparison of two models: one
model that represents the hypothesis of row-column independence (H0) and the other model that represents the
hypothesis of row-column dependence (H1). Before providing the tests in detail it is necessary to establish some
notation first. Readers who are more interested in the practical application than in the statistical details are invited to
skip ahead to the section with practical examples.
Let y∗∗be a data matrix of R rows and C columns:
y11 y12 · · · y1C
y21 y22 · · · y2C
yR1 yR2 · · · yRC
and let a∗∗be a matrix of prior parameters with the same
dimension as the data matrix y∗∗:
a11 a12 · · · a1C
a21 a22 · · · a2C
aR1 aR2 · · · aRC
In vector form, ⃗y
(y11, y12, ..., yRC) and ⃗a
(a11, a12, ..., aRC). In the following, recall that a dot is used
to indicate summation across a particular dimension (row or
column), and note that a star is used to indicate the entire
vector of that dimension. This is clarified by the equations
yrc = y11 + y12 + ... + yRC
yrc = (y1., ..., yR.)
yrc = (y.1, ..., y.C)
arc = (a1., ..., aR.)
Behav Res 49:
arc = (a.1, ..., a.C)
ξ∗. = a∗. −(C −1)
ξ.∗= a.∗−(R −1)
ξ.. = a.. −(R −1)(C −1)
For the matrix of prior parameters a∗∗(i.e., the gamma
shape parameters of the Poisson rates for the cell counts, see
below), a default value is obtained when each arc = a = 1
– in the multinomial case, this indicates that every combination of parameter values is equally likely a priori. Higher
values of a bring the predictions of H1 closer to those of
H0; the prior distribution under a = 10, for instance, may
be thought of as an uninformative a = 1 prior distribution
that has been updated using 9 hypothetical observations in
each cell of the table. For the data in Table 1, y.. = 34,
y∗. = (18, 16) a vector of row totals, and y.∗= (11, 23) a
vector of column totals. When a = 1 then a∗. = (2, 2) and
a.∗= (2, 2). Consequently, ξ∗. is a vector of ones of length
R, the number of rows, ξ.∗is a vector of ones of length
C, the number of columns, and ξ.. = 3 . Finally, D() is a
Dirichlet function defined in Eq. 5j .
Four Bayes factors
Below we describe, separately for the four sampling
schemes, the GD74 contingency table Bayes factors in support of the row-column independence model H0 over the
row-column dependence model H1. Bayes factors are often
difficult to calculate, as they are obtained by integrating over
the entire parameter space, a process that is non-trivial when
the integrals are high-dimensional and intractable. GD74’s
Bayes factors, however, only require computation of common functions such as gamma functions, for which numerical approximations are readily available. GD74 achieved
this simplicity through a series of model restrictions and
data conditionalization.
In order to describe how GD74 simplified their Bayes
factor calculations, we must first introduce the idea of a
“conditional” Bayes factor. Consider testing a simple normal mean and variance with two participants. The specific
hypotheses do not matter; we instead focus on the information in the data. If we were sampling sequentially, we
might compute the Bayes factor for our hypothesis after
the first participant, and then after the second participant.
The second Bayes factor takes into account all the data, and
includes all the information from both participants. We can
also look at the Bayes factor due to having observed participant 2’s data, already taking into account the data from
participant 1. This Bayes factor represents the “extra” information about the hypothesis offered by participant 2 over
and above that offered by participant 1. We can call it the
Bayes factor for participant 2 given, or conditional on, participant 1. However, we can partition the data in other ways
besides participants. Since the sample mean and variance
jointly capture all the information in the data, we can also
describe the Bayes factor for the sample mean conditioned
on knowing the sample variance.
In the context of contingency tables, there are logical
ways of partitioning the data. To begin, we partition the data
into a part that contains the information about the overall
quantity of observations, and a part that contains the information about how cells differ from one another. To compute
the evidence assuming that the total number of observations
is fixed, we look at the change from the Bayes factor using
only the first part of the data (the total number of observations) to the Bayes factor conditioned on the whole data
set. Due to the way GD74 parameterized their models –
model parameters corresponding to the components of the
partition– this successive conditionalization produces Bayes
factors that are easy to compute.
Bayes factor under the Poisson sampling scheme
Under this sampling scheme, none of the cell counts
are fixed. Each cell count is assumed to be Poisson distributed: yrc ∼Poisson(λrc). Each of the rate parameters λrc is assigned a conjugate gamma prior with shape
parameter a and scale parameter b: λrc ∼(arc, b).
Here, (arc, b) =
(a)λa−1e−bλ, λ > 0, a > 0 and
b > 0 and (a) is the gamma function (a) = (a −1)!.
The Bayes factor for independence under the Poisson
sampling scheme is (Equation 4.2 in GD74):
01 = (1 + 1/b)(R−1)(C−1) (y.. + ξ..)
(yrc + arc)
D(y∗.+ ξ∗.)
D(y.∗+ ξ.∗)
where b = R × C × a/y.. is the default value of the
gamma scale parameter suggested by GD74.4
For the 2 × 2 table with a = 1, the Bayes factor
simplifies to
10 = 8 (y.. + 1)(y1. + 1)
(y.. + 4)(y.. + 2)
 y11! y12! y21! y22! y..!
(y1. + 1)! y2.! y.1! y.2!
Bayes factor under the joint multinomial sampling
Under this sampling scheme, the grand total y.. is
fixed. Cell counts are assumed to be jointly multinomially distributed: (y11, ..., yrc) ∼Multinomial(y.., π∗∗).
4Note that for the other sampling schemes the b parameter plays no
Behav Res 49:
The prior distribution on the multinomial parameters is the conjugate Dirichlet distribution: π∗∗
Dirichlet(a∗∗). The Bayes factor for independence
under the joint multinomial sampling scheme is :
01 = D(y∗. + ξ∗.)
D(y.∗+ ξ.∗)
D(y∗∗+ a∗∗). (8)
For the 2 × 2 table with a = 1, the Bayes factor
simplifies to
10 = 6 (y.. + 1)(y1. + 1)
(y.. + 3)(y.. + 2)
 y11! y12! y21! y22! y..!
(y1. + 1)! y2.! y.1! y.2!
Bayes factor under the independent multinomial sampling scheme
Under this sampling scheme, one margin (rows or
columns) in the contingency table is fixed. Cell counts
are assumed to be independently multinomially distributed. The Bayes factor for independence under this
sampling scheme is (Equation 4.7 in GD74):
01 = D(y.∗+ ξ.∗)
D(y∗. + a∗.)
D(y∗∗+ a∗∗).
This Bayes factor is derived under the assumption that
the row margins are fixed. To derive the Bayes factor under the assumption that the column margins are
fixed, it suffices to interchange the rows and columns in
01 = D(y∗. + ξ∗.)
D(y.∗+ a.∗)
D(y∗∗+ a∗∗).
For the 2 × 2 contingency table, the Bayes factor for
the independent multinomial sampling plan reduces to
a test for the equality of two proportions, θ1 and θ2.
Under the default setting a = 1, Eq. (11) then simplifies to (y.2 + 1)
(y.1 + y.2 + 1) ,
where the left-hand side features binomial coefficients.
The Bayes factor BFI
01 –or its inverse, which quantifies the evidence for H1, that is, BFI
10 = 1/BFI
is a two-sided test. In experimental disciplines, however, researchers often have strong prior beliefs about
the direction of the effect under scrutiny. For instance,
Dutton and Aron set out to test whether emotional arousal stimulates attraction, not whether emotional arousal dampens attraction. A one-sided Bayes
factor that respects the directional nature of the alternative hypothesis needs to assess the support for hypothesis H+
one-sided Bayes factors can be obtained easily .
To see this, we first decompose the desired one-sided
Bayes factor, say BF+0, into two parts:5
BF+0 = p(y | H+)
= p(y | H+)
p(y | H1) × p(y | H1)
= BF+1 × BF10.
Thus, in order to obtain the one-sided BF+0, we
need to adjust the two-sided BF10 by the factor BF+1,
which quantifies the evidence for the directional alternative hypothesis H+ over the undirectional alternative
hypothesis H1. To obtain this evidence, we use a simple procedure outlined by Klugkist, Laudy, and Hoijtink
 , who noted that BF+1 equals the ratio of posterior and prior mass under H1 that is consistent with the
restriction postulated by H+. That is, BF+1 = p(θ1 >
θ2 | y, H1)/p(θ1 > θ2 | H1); for symmetric prior
distributions, the correction factor further simplifies to
BF+1 = 2 × p(θ1 > θ2 | y, H1). From this expression it is evident that incorporating the direction of the
effect in the specification of the alternative hypothesis
can increase the Bayes factor in its favor by no more
than twofold.
Bayes factor under the hypergeometric sample scheme.
In a 2 × 2 table the conditional distribution of y11
given both margins fixed (i.e., p(y11 | y1., y2., y.1, ψ))
is a noncentral hypergeometric distribution:
p(y11 | y1., y2., y.1, ψ)=
min(y1.,y.1)
i=max(0,y1.−y.2)
for 0 < y1. ≤y.1 + y.2 and max(0, y1. −y.2) ≤y11 ≤
min(y1., y.1). The noncentral hypergeometric distribution equals the hypergeometric distribution when the
odds ratio (ψ) = 1.
5As before, the first BF subscript indicates the model in the numerator,
and the second subscript indicates the model in the denominator of
Eq. 2; hence, BF+0 = 1/BF0+.
Behav Res 49:
The Bayes factor for independence under the hypergeometric sampling scheme is (Equation 4.11 in
D(a∗∗)  g(y∗∗; y.., a∗∗)
D(y∗∗+ a∗∗)
g(y∗∗; y.., a∗∗) =
 D(y∗∗+ a∗∗)
and  is a summation over y′
∗∗with all margins fixed.
For the 2 × 2 table with a = 1, Eq. 15 is equivalent
to the Bayes factor proposed by Jeffreys :
10 = y11! y12! y21! y22! y..!
(y1. + 1)! y2.! y.1! y.2!,
where y1. = min(y1., y2., y.1, y.2), that is, the smallest
of the four marginal totals.
For all four Bayes factors, the parameter matrix a∗∗quantifies the prior uncertainty. By default, each element of the
matrix is assigned the same number a. For the Dirichlet
distribution, the priors are uniform across their range when
a = 1. This is the default choice of GD74 and we will
explore the Bayes factors outlined here with this choice in
mind. As usual, robustness of statistical conclusions may
be checked by varying the prior precision along a plausible
range of values. Note the uniform choice assumes that differences between marginal probabilities are expected to be
large. If smaller effects are expected, the a parameter may
be increased.
Relation between the four Bayes factors for the 2 × 2
To quantify the relationship between the Bayes factors for
each of the four sampling plans discussed above we focus
on the 2 × 2 contingency table and use the default prior
setting a = 1. It is then possible to derive the ratio for pairs
of Bayes factors; for instance, the ratio between the Bayes
factor for the Poisson sampling plan and the hypergeometric
sampling plan is obtained as BFP
10. All ratios of Bayes
factors are shown in Table 3; the cell in the first row and
final column shows the outcome for BFP
Table 3 reveals that the evidence in favor of the rowcolumn dependence hypothesis H1 decreases with the successive conditioning on the table margins and totals. In other
words, the Bayes factor BF10 is largest for the Poisson sampling plan, and smallest for the hypergeometric sampling

The ratios are obtained by dividing the Bayes factor shown in rows by
that shown in columns. Note that BF10 = 1/BF01. See text for details
Simulation
To explore the behavior of the four Bayes factors further we
conducted two simulations, each with synthetic data from a
2 × 2 contingency table. In the first simulation, we took the
table ⃗y = (3, 3, 2, 5) with y.. = 3 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 13 as a
point of departure, with an log odds ratio of 0.91 and a corresponding 95 % confidence interval of (−1.37, 3.20). We
then created a total of 30 contingency tables by multiplying
each cell count by a factor c, where c = 1, 2, ..., 30. Hence,
the grand total number of observations varied from y.. = 13
at c = 1, through y.. = 195 at c = 15, to y.. = 390 at
For each of the 30 contingency tables, we calculated
the GD74 Bayes factors under each of the four sampling
schemes. Figure 1 shows the results. As expected, the evidence against the null hypothesis increases with sample
size. For low sample sizes, the Bayes factors indicate that

Behav Res 49:
the evidence is merely anecdotal, favoring H1 —or sometimes even H0— by less than a factor of three. In addition,
the different Bayes factors all show a linear increase in
the log Bayes factor as sample size increases. The evidential gap between the Bayes factor for the Poisson sampling
scheme and the hypergeometric sampling scheme approximately spans an entire Jeffreys category. For instance, when
c = 10 the hypergeometric BFH
10 = 3.04, whereas the Poisson BFP
10 = 9.19, suggesting that the differences between
the Bayes factors under the different sampling models can
be substantial.
In the second simulation, we took the table ⃗y
(5, 5, 5, 5) as a point of departure, with an odds ratio of 1.
We created a total of 50 contingency tables by multiplying
each cell count by a factor c, where c = 1, 2, ..., 50. Hence,
the grand total number of observations varied from y.. = 20
at c = 1, through y.. = 500 at c = 25, to y.. = 1000 at
c = 50. For each table, the counts are uniformly distributed
across the cells and this should yield the maximum possible
evidence for H0. As before, for each of the 30 contingency
tables we calculated the GD74 Bayes factors under each of
the four sampling schemes. Figure 2 shows the results.
As expected, the evidence in favor of H0 –independence
between rows and columns– increases with sample size.
The speed of the increase is less pronounced than it was
in the first simulation — a reflection of the general rule
that for nested models, it is often relatively difficult to find
compelling evidence in favor of the absence of an effect
 . Consistent with the mathematical relation
displayed in Table 3, the evidential order has reversed; the

strongest evidence is now provided by the hypergeometric
Bayes factor, whereas the Poisson Bayes factor is the most
reluctant of the four in its support for H0. The order-reversal
suggests that, with default GD74 priors, the Poisson model
has more prior mass in the vicinity of the null hypothesis
than does the hypergeometric model.
In sum, the simulations confirm that the Bayes factor
support grows with sample size; they also highlight that differences between the four Bayes factors cannot easily be
ignored, not even asymptotically.
This section underscores the practical relevance of the
GD74 Bayes factors by discussing a concrete example for
eachof the four sampling plans. For comparison,we also report
the results from p-value null-hypothesis statistical testing.
Poisson sampling example: fathers and sons
Table 4 shows the contingency table for professional occupations of 775 fathers and their sons; the data were collected
by Miss Emily Perrin and published by Pearson . The diagonal entries –shown in bold italic– indicate the
number of cases where the son’s occupation matches that of
his father.
For illustrative purposes, we assume that sampling was
based on a Poisson scheme, such that any cell count can take
on any value, and the grand total was not fixed in advance. A
frequentist test of independence between rows and columns
(df =169,y..=775) = 1005.45 and p < .001: we can
reject the the null hypothesis of independence and conclude
that there is an association between the profession of fathers
and their sons. However, the p-value does not quantify how
much these data should shift our belief. To address this
question we calculate the Poisson GD74 Bayes factor and
obtain log BFP
10 = 262.21, indicating extreme evidence for
the hypothesis that there exists an association between the
occupations of fathers and their sons.
Joint multinomial sampling example: job satisfaction
The left panel of Fig. 3 shows data from a 1968 job satisfaction questionnaire among 715 blue collar industrial workers
in Denmark . One expects an association between supervisor satisfaction and worker satisfaction,
expressed by an abundance of counts on the diagonal cell
For illustrative purposes, we assume that sampling
was based on a joint multinomial scheme, such that
the grand total of 715 workers was fixed. A frequentist
test of independence between rows and columns yields

(df =1,y..=715) = 15.81 and p < .001: we can reject the the
null hypothesis of independence and conclude that there is
an association between the satisfaction of supervisors and
workers. However, the p-value does not quantify how much
these data should shift our belief. To address this question
we calculate the joint multinomial GD74 Bayes factor and
obtain BFM
10 = 373.13, indicating extreme evidence for
the hypothesis that there exists an association between the
satisfaction level of supervisors and workers.
In addition, the right panel of Fig. 3 shows the posterior
distribution of the log odds ratio . The 95 % credible
interval for the log odds ratio spans the range from 0.31 to
0.92, and the median value equals log(1.85) = 0.61; note
that independence corresponds to a log odds ratio of zero.
The classical estimate of the log odds ratio is 0.62 and the
classical 95 % confidence interval is (0.31, 0.92).
Independent multinomial example: dolls
The left panel of Fig. 4 shows data from a classic study on
racial preference among school children . Among 160 Nebraska children aged 4-8, 62 out of
89 African American children (69 %) preferred to play with
a black doll instead of a white doll, whereas 60 out of 71

For illustrative purposes, we assume that sampling was
based on an independent multinomial scheme, such that the
crucial test involves a comparison of two proportions. A frequentist test of independence between rows and columns
(df =1,y..=160) = 46.71 and p < .001: we can reject
the the null hypothesis of independence and conclude that
there is an association between children’s race and the color
of the doll they prefer to play with. However, the p-value
does not quantify how much these data should shift our
belief. To address this question we calculate the independent multinomial GD74 Bayes factor and obtain log BFI
23.03, indicating strong evidence for the hypothesis that
there exists an association between children’s race and the
color of the doll they preferred to play with.
In addition, the right panel of Fig. 4 shows the posterior
distribution of the log odds ratio. The 95 % credible interval
for the log odds ratio spans the range from 1.73 to 3.26,
and the median value equals log(11.82) = 2.47. The classical
estimate of the log odds ratio is 2.52 and the classical 95 %
confidence interval is (1.74, 3.31).

reported in Anderson 
Sibling acceptance
Hypergeometric example: siblings
The left panel of Table 5 shows data from 30 first-born children, aged 3-5, and their attitude towards a soon-to-be-born
sibling . The contingency table has been constructed
using a median split for the variables age (younger versus
older) and sibling acceptance (lower versus higher). Hence,
both margins are fixed and the sampling scheme is hypergeometric. At issue is the question of whether there exists a
relation between age and sibling acceptance.
A frequentist test of independence between rows and
columns yields χ2
(df =1,y..=30) = 1.2 and p = 0.27: we fail
to reject the null hypothesis of independence and conclude
that there is insufficient evidence for an association between
age and sibling acceptance. However, the p-value does not
quantify how much these data should shift our belief in favor
of the independence hypothesis. To address this question we
calculate the hypergeometric GD74 Bayes factor and obtain
10 = 0.39, indicating that the observed data are about
1/0.39 = 2.56 times more likely under the null hypothesis of independence than under the alternative hypothesis of
dependence.
Concluding comments
In this article, we discussed a series of default Bayes factors for the analysis of R × C contingency tables and
we illustrated their use with concrete examples. Following Gunel and Dickey , we distinguished four sampling schemes. In order of increasing restriction, these are
Poisson, joint multinomial, independent multinomial, and
Behav Res 49:
hypergeometric. The prior distributions for each model are
obtained by successive conditioning on fixed cell frequencies or margins.
The use of Bayes factors affords researchers several concrete advantages. For instance, Bayes factors can quantify
evidence in favor of the null hypothesis and Bayes factors
may be monitored as the data accumulate, without the need
for any kind of correction . The latter
advantage is particularly pronounced when the relevant data
are obtained from a natural process that unfolds over time
without any predefined stopping point.
It may be argued that these Bayesian advantages have
long been within reach, as Bayes factors for contingency
tables have been developed and proposed well over half a
century ago . Nevertheless, for the analysis of contingency tables researchers almost exclusively use
classical methods, obtaining p-values through chi-square
test and likelihood ratio tests. One reason for the neglect
of Bayesian methods in the empirical sciences is that they
lack implementation in user-friendly software packages. We
have tried to overcome this obstacle by providing R syntax (see Appendix) and by incorporating the GD1974 Bayes
factor in the BayesFactor package through the function
contingencyTableBF(). In addition, we have also
made the GD74 Bayes factors available in the open-source
statistical package JASP (www.jasp-stats.org).
Before closing, let us return to the data in Table 1.
The classical analysis suggested that men who were interviewed on the fear-arousing bridge rather than the solid
wood bridge called the female interviewer more often (p <
.02). The relevant GD74 Bayes factor assumes an independent multinomial sampling scheme; in the case of the
2 table, the test simplifies to a comparison between two
proportions. The Bayes factor yields BFI
10 = 5.31, which
indicates that data are about 5 times more likely under H1
than they are under H0. However, the authors’ hypothesis
implies that the alternative hypothesis is one-sided. Following the method described above and elsewhere , we compute the Bayes factor for
H+ versus H0 to be BF+0 = 10.50; according to the classification scheme proposed by Jeffreys, this is strong but not
overwhelming evidence for the presence of an effect.
The GD74 Bayes factors are but one of many Bayesian
analyses that have been proposed for the analysis of R × C
contingency tables. Other early approaches include Altham
 ; Good ; Good and Crook ;
Jeffreys . The approach by Altham focuses
on parameter estimation rather than on hypothesis testing, whereas the approaches advocated by Good and by
Jeffreys are similar to those outlined here. Another alternative Bayesian approach is Poisson regression or log-linear
modeling , a
discussion of which is beyond the scope of the current work.
Also note that the GD74 approach hinges on the use of
prior distributions of a particular form; if the user wishes to
specify prior distributions from a different family, analytical
results may no longer be possible, and one would have to
turn to Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques , which permits unrestricted
use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give
appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a

Appendix A: Bayes Factor R Code
This appendix provides the R code that produces the
Bayes factors for the examples discussed in the main text.
The main function, contingencyTableBF(), has been
incorporated in the R “BayesFactor” package .
The syntax for the contingencyTableBF() function has the following form:
contingencyTableBF(x, sampleType,
fixedMargin = NULL, priorConcentration = 1,
where the argument x is an “R” by “C” data matrix and
sample type specifies the sampling plan ( “poisson”,
“jointMulti”, “indepMulti”, “hypergeom”). The argument
fixedMargin is for the independent multinomial sampling plan, to fix one of the margins (“rows” or “cols”);
finally, the argument priorConcentration allows the
user to deviate from the default prior setting where a = 1.

Appendix B: JASP
The GD74 Bayes factors are also available in JASP, a free
and open-source statistical software package that will be
familiar to users of SPSS (jasp-stats.org). In JASP, the user
drags and drops variables to input boxes, and subsequently
selects analysis options through mouse clicks. A screenshot
of JASP is provided in Fig. 5.

sampling model and computes the log odds ratio.
