We consider joint probability distributions for the class of coupled Langevin equations introduced
by Fogedby [H.C. Fogedby, Phys. Rev. E 50, 1657 ]. We generalize well-known results for
the single time probability distributions to the case of N-time joint probability distributions. It is
shown that these probability distribution functions can be obtained by an integral transform from
distributions of a Markovian process. The integral kernel obeys a partial diﬀerential equation with
fractional time derivatives reﬂecting the non-Markovian character of the process.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the connections between ”continuous time random walk” (CTRW), which originated in the work of
Montroll and Weiss generalizing the idea of Brownian random walks, and fractional Fokker-Planck equations have
been established. For a review we refer the reader to . The solutions of these equations exhibit both super- and
subdiﬀusive behaviour and are thus appropriate models for a large variety of transport processes in complex systems
 . Recently, a connection between the velocity increment statistics of a Lagrangian tracer particle in fully developed
turbulent ﬂows and a type of CTRW has been introduced . Here, a closure assumption on a hierarchy of joint
velocity-position pdf’s derived from a statistical formulation of the Navier-Stokes equation leads to a generalization of
Obukhov’s random walk model in terms of a continous time random walk. It allows for a successful parametrization
of the single time probability distributions of velocity increments. However, there are diﬀerent suggestions for the
stochastic process of Lagrangian particles in turbulence, which are able to provide reasonable approximations for the
single time velocity increment statistics. This example evidences that one has to introduce further quantities in order
to distinguish between diﬀerent stochastic models.
For non-Markovian processes, the natural extension is the consideration of N-times joint probability distributions.
It seems that for the class of CTRWs only single time probability distributions have been investigated so far. In that
case fractional diﬀusion equations of the form
∂tf(x, t) = 0D1−α
can be derived. Here x denotes the random variable, L is a Fokker-Planck operator (for diﬀusion processes L =
is the Riemann-Liouville fractional diﬀerential operator (c.f. appendix A). The properties of this equation
with regard to physical applications have been extensively discussed in the recent reviews , . In Fogedby
introduced a class of coupled Langevin equations, where he also considered a case which leads to an operator L
including fractional derivatives with respect to the variable x, L =
∂xβ . A similar case has been studied by Meerschaert
et al. , who made an extension to several dimensions introducing a multidimensional generalization of fractional
diﬀusion, so-called operator L´evy motion. This allows for a description of anomalous diﬀusion with direction dependent
Hurst indices Hi deﬁned by the relation < (xi(t) −xi(t = 0))2 >≈t2Hi. In limit theorems of a class of continuous
time random walks with inﬁnite mean waiting times have been investigated. It is shown that the limit process obeys
a fractional Cauchy problem. The emphasis again is put on single time distributions.
The purpose of the present paper is to investigate multiple time probability distribution functions for the class
of coupled Langevin equations introduced by Fogedby , which have been considered to be a representation of a
continuous time random walk.
The paper is outlined as follows.
In the next section we present the coupled Langevin equations considered
by Fogedby consisting of a usual Langevin process X(s) in a coordinate s and a L´evy process representing a
stochastic relation t(s). One is interested in the process X(t) = X(s−1(t)). Fogedby investigated the case where
the processes X(s) and t(s) are statistically independent and showed how fractional diﬀusion equations of the form
(1) arise. Interesting results for the case where the processes are statistically dependent have been considered by
Becker-Kern et al. leading to generalizations of the fractional diﬀusion equations (1). However, both publications
are devoted to single time probability distributions.
In section II we present a central formula, which relates the N-times probability distributions of X(t) to the pdf’s
of X(s) via an integral transform, which is determined by the process t(s). In section III properties of the involved
 
L´evy-stable process t(s) are considered leading to expressions for the pdf of the inverse process s(t). In section V we
specify the moments for the case of a simple diﬀusion process.
A CLASS OF NON-MARKOVIAN PROCESSES
Starting point of our discussion is the set of coupled Langevin equations for the motion of a Brownian particle
in an external force ﬁeld F in d=1 dimensions (an extension to higher dimensions d > 1 is straightforward):
= F(X) + η(s),
In this framework the random walk is parametrized in terms of the continuous path variable s, which may be
considered eg. as arc length along the trajectory. X(s) and t(s) denote the position and time in physical space. The
random variables η(s) and τ(s) are responsible for the stochastic character of the process. We are only considering the
case of uncoupled jump lengths and waiting times such that η and τ are statistically independent (coupled CTRWs
have been considered in ). The arc lenght is related to physical time t by the inverse function s = t−1(t) = s(t).
Thus, we have to assume τ(s) > 0. We are interested in the process X(s(t)), i.e. the behaviour of the variable X as
a function of physical time t.
For the characterization of the process we introduce the two-times probability density functions (pdf) for the processes
f1(x2, s2; x1, s1) = < δ(x2 −X(s2))δ(x1 −X(s1)) >
p(t2, s2; t1, s1) = < δ(t2 −t(s2))δ(t1 −t(s1)) >
f(x2, t2; x1, t1) = < δ(x2 −X(s(t2)))δ(x1 −X(s(t1))) >
Here the brackets < .. > denote a suitable average over stochastic realizations. For the sake of simplicity we restrict
ourselves to n = 2. The generalization to multiple times is obvious. Both probability functions are determined by the
statistics of the independent random variables η and τ.
The process X(s)
We consider the case where η(s) is the standard Langevin force, i.e. η is a Wiener process. In turn (2) becomes
Markovian and f1(x2, s2; x1, s1) can be determined by solving the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) for
the conditional probability distribution P(x2, s2 | x1, s1):
∂sP(x2, s2 | x1, s1) =
∂xF(x) + ∂2
P(x2, s2 | x1, s1)
= LF P (x)P(x2, s2 | x1, s1)
The diﬀusion constant is set to 1 in the following. Due to the Markovian property of the process X(s) the joint pdf
is obtained by multiplication with the single time pdf according to
f1(x2, s2; x1, s1) = P(x2, s2 | x1, s1)f(x1, s1)
For a general treatment of the FPE we refer the reader to the monographs of Risken and Gardiner .
The process t(s)
The stochastic process t(s) is determined by the properties of τ(s). The corresponding pdf’s are denoted by p(t, s),
p(t2, s2; t1, s1). Furthermore, we shall consider τ(s) to be a (one-sided) L´evy-stable process of order α , with
0 < α < 1. As a result, the process t(s) is Markovian. L´evy-stable processes of this kind induce the property of a
diverging characteristic waiting time < t(s) > . Consequently the stochastic process in physical time t, given by the
coupling of the Langevin equations (2) and (3) reveals subdiﬀusive behaviour. The speciﬁc form of p(t2, s2; t1, s1) will
be given below.
For a deeper discussion we refer to the review articles , , where the general relation between subdiﬀusive
behaviour and diverging waiting times has been treated in detail.
FIG. 1: Sketch of the process t(s) which relates the arc length s to physical time t. Since the increment τ(s) of eq.(3) is positive,
the curve t(s) is monotonically increasing, implying the validity of the relation (14). .
The process X(t) = X(s(t))
We are interested in the properties of the variable X with respect to the physical time t. Therefore, we have to
consider the inverse of the stochastic process t = t(s):
s = t−1(t) = s(t)
The stochastic process X(s(t)) then is described by the joint probability distribution
f(x2, t2; x1, t1) =< δ(x2 −X(s2))δ(s2 −s(t2))δ(x1 −X(s1))δ(s1 −s(t1)) >
The N-point distributions are determined in a similar way. Introducing the probability distribution h for the inverse
process s(t),
h(s, t) = < δ(s −s(t)) >
h(s2, t2; s1, t1) = < δ(s2 −s(t2))δ(s1 −s(t1)) >
we can calculate the pdf of the process X(t) = X(s(t)) as a function of the physical time by eliminating the path
variables si:
f(x2, t2; x1, t1) =
ds2 h(s2, t2; s1, t1)f1(x2, s2; x1, s1)
This relationship is due to the fact that the processes X(s) and t(s) are statistically independent. In that case, the
expectation values in (10) factorize. Equation (12) can be generalized to N times. In fact, one may turn over to a
path integral representation:
Ds(t)h(s(t))f1(x(s(t)))
However, we do not investigate this path integral further.
The probability distribution h can be determined with the help of the cumulative distribution function of
s(t). Since the process t(s) has the property (for s > 0) s2 > s1 →t(s2) > t(s1), one has the relationship
Θ(s −s(t)) = 1 −Θ(t −t(s))
Here, we have introduced the Heaviside step function: Θ(x) = 1 for x > 0 and Θ(x) = 0 for x < 0, Θ(x = 0) = 1/2.
The validity of eq.(14) becomes evident from an inspection of ﬁg. 1: The function Θ(s −s(t)) equals one in the
region above the curve t = t(s), whereas Θ(t −t(s) equals one in the region below the curve t = t(s). On the curve
Θ(s −s(t)) = 1/2 = Θ(t −t(s)).
An immediate consequence is the following connection among the cumulative distribution functions of the processes
t(s) and s(t):
< Θ(s −s(t)) > = 1−< Θ(t −t(s)) >
< Θ(s2 −s(t2))Θ(s1 −s(t1) > = < (1 −Θ(t2 −t(s2)))(1 −Θ(t1 −t(s1))) >
= 1−< Θ(t2 −t(s2)) > −< Θ(t1 −t(s1)) >
+ < Θ(t2 −t(s2))Θ(t1 −t(s1) >
Simple diﬀerentiation of eq.(15) yields the probability density function h of the process s(t):
h(s, t) = −∂
∂s < Θ(t −t(s)) >
h(s2, t2; s1, t1) =
< Θ(t2 −t(s2))Θ(t1 −t(s1)) >
Furthermore, since for t = 0 we have the correspondence s = 0, the usual boundary conditions hold:
h(s, 0) = δ(s)
h(s2, t2; s1, 0) = h(s2, t2)δ(s1)
h(s2, t2 →t1; s1, t1) = δ(s2 −s1)h(s1, t1)
and can be veriﬁed from eq.(16).
DETERMINATION OF THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS p(s, t): L´EVY-STABLE PROCESSES
In the following we shall consider the joint multiple times pdf of the L´evy-stable process (3) of order α. Simple
integration of (3) yields
where we assume τ(s) > 0. Additionally, we consider the characteristic function for ω = iλ. This deﬁnes the Laplace
Z(λ2, s2; λ1, s1) := L{p(t2, s2; t1, s1)} =
dt1 e−λ2t2−λ1t1 p(t2, s2; t1, s1)
It will become clear below that working with Laplace transforms is more convenient for manipulating the pdf’s of
process (3) in the present context.
One-sided L´evy-stable processes: Single time
At this point we have to introduce speciﬁc properties of the L´evy-stable process. L´evy distributions Lα,β(x) are
deﬁned by two parameters , : α characterizes the asymptotic behaviour of the stable distribution for large x
and hence the critical order of diverging moments. β characterizes the asymmetry. In the present case τ > 0 and
the distribution is maximally asymmetric p(t < 0, s) = 0. This leads to β = 1. In the following we denote the L´evy
distribution Lα,β(x) for β = 1 by Lα(x).
Let us motivate the consideration of L´evy statistics. To this end we consider the characteristic function, which we
write in the form:
Z(λ, s) = < e−λs1/α
0 ds′τ(s′) >
where α is a certain parameter. The choice Z(λ, s) = ˜Z(λαs) leads to a scale invariant pdf p(t, s) = 1/s1/αP(
As a result, the characteristic function takes the form
Z(λ, s) = e−λαs
where we assume 0 < α < 1.
The probability distribution then becomes
where Lα(t) denotes the one sided L´evy stable distribution whose Laplace transform is L{Lα(t)} = e−λα.
Multiple times
The joint pdf of the Levy process t(s) has been introduced in eq.(5). Starting with this deﬁnition the derivation of
the explicit expression for the pdf is straightforward and clearly reveals the Markovian character of this process. The
characteristic function is given as Laplace transform of eq.(5):
Z(λ2, s2; λ1, s1) =
dt1 e−λ2t2−λ1t1 p(t2, s2; t1, s1)
ds′τ(s′)−λ1
ds′τ(s′) >
For further evaluating this expression we have to distinguish between the cases s2 > s1 and s1 > s2. With a given
ordering of s2, s1 we can rearrange the integrals and write Z as a sum of two contributions:
Z(λ2, s2; λ1, s1) = Θ(s2 −s1) < e
ds′τ(s′)−(λ1+λ2)R s1
ds′τ(s′) >
+Θ(s1 −s2) < e
ds′τ(s′)−(λ1+λ2)R s2
ds′τ(s′) >
Here the expectation values factorize due to statistical independence of the increments τ and can be expressed
according to eq.(21):
Z(λ2, s2; λ1, s1) = Θ(s2 −s1)e−s1(λ1+λ2)αe−(s2−s1)λα
+Θ(s1 −s2)e−s2(λ1+λ2)αe−(s1−s2)λα
This is the characteristic function of the Levy process for multiple times. The appearance of the exponents (λ1 +λ2)α
is characteristic in this context and carries over to the pdf of the inverse process. We obtain the pdf p(s2, t2; s1, t1)
after performing the inverse Laplace transform of eq.(25). The result is
p(t2, s2; t1, s1) = Θ(s2 −s1)
(s2 −s1)1/α Lα
(s2 −s1)1/α
+Θ(s1 −s2)
(s1 −s2)1/α Lα
(s1 −s2)1/α
This expression explicitly exhibits the Markovian nature of the process. The conditional pdf p(t2, s2|t1, s1) for s2 > s1
p(t2, s2|t1, s1) =
(s2 −s1)1/α Lα
(s2 −s1)1/α
We remind the reader that Lα(x) = 0 for negative values of x. The expression for the joint pdf for multiple points is
THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS h(s, t)
The pdf’s h(s, t), h(s2, t2; s1, t1) of the inverse process s = s(t) can be obtained from the pdf’s of the process
t = t(s) with the help of relationship eq.(16). We shall consider the single- and multiple-time cases separately. Again,
due to the simple form of the Levy distributions in Laplace space, we perform most of the calculations with Laplace
transforms.
Single time
Using the notation ˜h(s, λ) = L{h(s, t)} for the Laplace transform of h(s, t) with respect to t, the relation eq.(16)
˜h(s, λ) = −∂
λe−λt(s) > = −∂
The derivative with respect to s is easily performed with eq.(21) and leads to the solution ˜h(s, λ):
˜h(s, λ) = λα−1e−sλα
This expression has already been derived in — however without giving a ‘simple physical argument’. Here the
derivation is clearly based on eq.(14) which relates the L´evy-stable process and its inverse.
The inverse Laplace transform of eq.(29) is known and has been calculated in :
h(s, t) = 1
s1+1/α Lα(
Moreover, in the single time distribution h(s, t) has been identiﬁed as the Mittag-Leﬄer distribution:
Here we have obtained the pdf of s(t) for single times. Therefore, a complete characterization of the inverse process
is given in this case.
However in order to derive an evolution equation for the pdf of the process X(s(t)) we require an equation which
determines h(s, t).
From eq.(29) it is evident that ˜h(s, λ) obeys the diﬀerential equation
˜h(s, λ) = λα˜h(s, λ)
with the initial condition ˜h(0, λ) = λα−1 for s = 0. Hence, Laplace inversion yields a fractional evolution equation for
∂th(s, t) = −0D1−α
The operator 0D1−α
denotes the Riemann-Liouville fractional diﬀerential operator, a possible generalization of integer
order diﬀerentiation and integration to fractional orders (see Appendix B). For a discussion of fractional derivatives
we refer the reader to .
Multiple times
The statistical characterization of the process s(t) for multiple times has been investigated from a mathematical
point of view in the work of Bingham already in 1971. He derived the following relationships for the moments
< s(tN)...s(t1) >:
< s(tN)...s(t1) > =
Γ(α)N [t1(t2 −t1)...(tN −tN−1)]α−1
This equation can be obtained from the previous relation (16), which inferes the following relationship between the
probability densities p(t, s) and h(s, t):
∂th(s, t) = −∂
h(s2, t2; s1, t2) =
p(t2, s2; t1, s1)
h(sN, tN; ...; s1, t2) = (−1)N
p(tN, sN; ...; t1, s1)
In the following we shall derive explicit expressions for these moments and show that instead of (34) fractional
equations can be used for their determination. Based on eq.(16) and eq.(25) the derivation of an expression for the
Laplace transform ˜h(s2, λ2; s1, λ1) := L{h(s2, t2; s1, t1)} is obtained in a way analogous to the single-time case.
We start by considering eq.(16) in Laplace-space:
˜h(s2, λ2; s1, λ1) =
e−λ2t(s2) 1
e−λ1t(s1) >
Z(λ2, s2; λ1, s1)
Using eq.(25) we can perform the derivatives of Z(λ2, s2; λ1, s1) with respect to s1, s2:
˜h(s2, λ2; s1, λ1) = δ(s2 −s1)λα
1 −(λ1 + λ2)α + λα
e−s1(λ1+λ2)α
+Θ(s2 −s1)(λα
2 )((λ1 + λ2)α −λα
e−(λ1+λ2)αs1e−λα
+Θ(s1 −s2)(λα
1 )((λ1 + λ2)α −λα
e−(λ1+λ2)αs2e−λα
As a result we have obtained the Laplace transform of the joint pdf h(s2, t2; s1, t1). Unfortunately, a closed form
of the inverse Laplace transform could not be calculated. The given solution ˜h can be readily used however to derive
meaningful expressions which characterize the inverse process s(t).
Moments of the inverse process
In order to obtain further information about the process s(t) for multiple times we calculate the moments of the
pdf. Let us ﬁrst demonstrate how this can be achieved for the simple case < s(t1)s(t2) >. This moment is deﬁned
from the pdf h(s2, t2; s1, t1) as:
< s(t1)s(t2) > =
ds2 s1s2 h(s2, t2; s1, t1)
ds2 s1s2 ˜h(s2, λ2; s1, λ1)
where the last step follows by interchanging inverse Laplace transform and integration. The integrations with respect
to s1, s2 can be simply performed with the help of expression eq.(36). The result is:
ds2 s1s2 ˜h(s2, λ2; s1, λ1) = (λ1 + λ2)−α
Now the inverse Laplace transform leads to an analytical solution for < s(t1)s(t2) > (see Appendix B):
< s(t1)s(t2) >
= Θ(t2 −t1)
Γ(2α + 1)t2α
Γ(α + 1)2 tα
α, −α; α + 1; t1
+Θ(t1 −t2)
Γ(2α + 1)t2α
Γ(α + 1)2 tα
α, −α; α + 1; t2
Here F(a, b; c; z) denotes the hypergeometric function (see e.g. Ch.15 in ).
One notices that in the limit t2 →t1 expression (40) agrees with the second moment < s(t)2 >:
< s(t)2 > = L−1
s2λα−1e−sλαds
Γ(2α + 1)t2α
where eq.(29) has been used. The simple single time moment < s(t) > is given as < s(t) >= L−1 
The calculation of higher order moments essentially follows the same steps.
Furthermore, we introduce the operator
in the sense of the single-time Riemann-Liouville fractional
diﬀerential operator: L{
g(t1, t2)} = (λ1 + λ2)−α˜g(λ1, λ2) (see Appendix A). An explicit expression in
terms of an integral reads:
g(t1, t2) =
Z Min(t1,t2)
dt′ t′α−1g(t1 −t′, t2 −t′)
Using this fractional diﬀerential operator, we are in the position to write down a simple recursion relation for
arbitrary moments of h({si, ti}). The second moment eq.(39) reads:
< s(t1)s(t2) > =
{< s(t1) > + < s(t2) >}
This immediately leads to (we assume t2 > t1):
< s(t2)s(t1) > =
t1 {< s(t2 −˜t1 + t1) > + < s(t1) >}
The explicit expression allows one to obtain the fusion rule
t2→t1 < s(t2)s(t1) > = < s(t1)2 >= 2
dt′ t′α−1 < s(t1 −t′) > = 20D−α
The calculation of the third order moment < s(t1)s(t2)s(t3) > along the same lines yields the result:
< s(t1)s(t2)s(t3) > =
{ < s(t1)s(t2) > + < s(t1)s(t3) >
+ < s(t2)s(t3) >}
The third moment is obtained via fractional integration of the sum of second order moments. In the general case, the
n-th order moment is calculated by fractional integration with respect to n times of the sum of all permutations of
n −1 order moments.
Due to the representation of the fractional operator
g(t1, t2, t3) =
Z Min(t1,t2,t3)
dt′ t′α−1g(t1 −t′, t2 −t′, t3 −t′),
we can derive the fusion rule
t3→t1+0 < s(t3)s(t2)s(t1) > =
dt′ t′α−1{< s(t1 −t′)s(t1 −t′) > +2 < s(t2 −t′)s(t1 −t′) >}
t1 {< s(t1)s(t1) > +2 < s(t2 −˜t1 + t1)s(t1) >}˜t1=t1
The fusion t2 →t1 leads to
< s(t1)3 > = 30D−α
< s(t1)2 > = 6D−α
< s(t1) > = 60D−2α
< s(t1) > .
The n-th order generalization reads:
< s(t)n > = n! 0D−(n−1)α
This equation can also be derived directly from ˜h(s, λ). Thus one can obtain a complete characterization of the
process s(t) based on eq.(37) or eq.(36) respectively. Below, we shall show how to obtain these results on the basis of
an evolution equation for the multipoint pdf h(s1, t1; ...; sN, tN).
The structure of the N-time pdf
From eq.(16) one can derive the general form of the pdf h of the inverse process s(t). The two times pdf reads (here
we assume the case s2 > s1 for simplicity)
h(s2, t2; s1, t1) =
1, s2 −s1) p(t′
1 h(s2 −s1, t2 −t′
H(s2 −s1, t2 −t1; s1 −s0, t1 −t0) = −∂
1 h(s2 −s1, t2 −t′
1 −t0, s1 −s0).
The form of the three times pdf is obtained in the same way and reads for s3 > s2 > s1:
h(s3, t3; s2, t2; s1, t1) =
2 h(s3 −s2, t3 −t′
1, s2 −s1) p(t′
with a straightforward extension to the general case.
With the help of eq.(52) this expression can be represented according to
h(s3, t3; s2, t2; s1, t1) = −∂
1 H(s3 −s2, t3 −t2; s2 −s1, t2 −t′
Recursively, we may deﬁne higher order functions
HN (sN −sN−1, tN −tN−1; ...; t1 −t0, s1 −s0)
1 HN−1(sN −sN−1, tN −tN−1; ...; s2 −s1, t2 −t′
1 −t0, s1, s0).
The integrals cannot simply be evaluated and the relations are formal. However, they show the underlying mathematical structure of the statistical description of the inverse process s(t).
Fractional evolution equation
In analogy to the single time case, where we have speciﬁed a fractional diﬀerential equation for h(s, t), we now
establish an evolution equation for h(s2, t2; s1, t1).
From eq.(37) it is evident that the following equation holds:
˜h(s2, λ2; s1, λ1) = −(λ1 + λ2)α˜h(s2, λ2; s1, λ1)
with initial conditions
˜h(0, λ2; 0, λ1) = λα
1 −(λ1 + λ2)α + λα
˜h(s2, λ2; 0, λ1) = (λα
2 )((λ1 + λ2)α −λα
˜h(0, λ2; s1, λ1) = (λα
1 )((λ1 + λ2)α −λα
A common way to solve ﬁrst order partial diﬀerential equations is the method of characteristics. Applying this method
to eq.(56) with the given initial condition for each case , one obtains the correct expressions eq.(37). Therefore eq.(56)
determines the pdf in Laplace space.
Consequently, upon performing the inverse Laplace transform, we derive that h(s2, t2; s1, t1) obeys the fractional
evolution equation
h(s2, t2; s1, t1) = −
h(s2, t2; s1, t1)
where the fractional diﬀerential operator
has been deﬁned according to
F(t2, t1) :=
F(t2, t1).
The appearance of fractional time derivatives in eq.(58) reveals the non-
Markovian character of the stochastic process s(t) and as a consequence of the coupled process X(s(t)).
The extension of the above result to n times is straightforward:
h({si, ti}) = −
h({si, ti})
Again we want to emphasize that this single evolution equation with the proper initial condition suﬃciently assets
the pdf for multiple times.
The above equation may also be used to calculate the moments < s(tN)...s(t1) >, which already have been speciﬁed
above. The fractional evolution equation (59) inferes the following relationship among the moments < s(tN)...s(t1) >:
< s(tN)...s(t1) > =
{< s(tN−1)...s(t1) > +Permut}
These equations are equivalent to the chain of equations (46) obtained by a direct inspection of the pdf’s.
TWO-TIME MOMENTS OF THE DIFFUSION PROCESS
In this last section we focus on the usual diﬀusion process, i.e. we consider the Fokker-Planck operator
In this case, the moments are polynomials in s and we may directly use the results of the preceding session:
< x(s2)x(s1) > = Θ(s2 −s1)s1 + Θ(s1 −s2)s2
The corresponding moment with respect to time t is given by
< x(t2)x(t1) > =
ds1ds2 h(s2, t2; s1, t1) < x(s2)x(s1) >
The integrations can be performed by inserting the pdf h in Laplace space:
L{< x(t2)x(t1) >} = (λ1 + λ2)α
ds s e−(λ1+λ2)αs =
(λ1 + λ2)αλ1λ2
The inverse transform leads to the result
< x(t2)x(t1) >
Γ(α + 1){Θ(t2 −t1)tα
1 + Θ(t1 −t2)tα
= Θ(t2 −t1) < s(t1) > +Θ(t1 −t2) < s(t2) >
Similarly, we may calculate the moment < x(t2)2x(t1)2 >:
< x(s2)2x(s1)2 > = s2s1 + 2Θ(s2 −s1)s2
1 + 2Θ(s1 −s2)s2
This yields
< x(t2)2x(t1)2 > = < s(t2)s(t1) > +2Θ(t2 −t1) < s(t1)2 > +2Θ(t1 −t2) < s(t2)2 > .
For the evaluation of < x(s2)2mx(s1)2n > we may use the properties of the moments of Gaussian processes which
read for n > m:
< x(s2)2mx(s1)2n > = Asm
1 + BΘ(s2 −s1)sn−m
2 + BΘ(s1 −s2)sn−m
The coeﬃcients A, B, C can be evaluated by an application of Wick’s theorem for Gaussian processes.
The corresponding expression for the process X(t) becomes accordingly:
< x(t2)2mx(t1)2n > = A < s(t2)ms(t1)n > +BΘ(t2 −t1) < s(t1)n−ms(t2)m >
+BΘ(t1 −t2) < s(t2)n−ms(t1)m >
The calculation of the expectation values < s(t2)2ms(t1)2n > has been discussed above.
CONCLUSION
Up to now the discussion of continuous time random walks and the corresponding fractional kinetic equations has
been focused on single time probability distributions only. On the basis of this pdf scaling behaviour of moments
have been compared with experiments.
However, more information has to be used in order to assign a deﬁnite
stochastic process to a non-Markovian process. To this end we have considered multiple times pdf for a certain class
of stochastic processes.
Our approach is based on the framework of coupled Langevin equations (2),(3) devised by Fogedby as a realization
of a continuous time random walk. Here, the solution for the N-times pdf’s are given as an integral transform of the
pdf’s of an accompanying Markovian process. We have shown that the non-Markovian character of this process can
be traced back to the properties of the inverse L´evy-stable process.
The next step would be to compare these theoretical predictions with the behaviour of physical systems which reveal
subdiﬀusive behaviour. To our knowledge multiple time statistics of such systems have not yet been investigated
experimentally.
This would be of considerable interest.
We may expect that in some cases the consideration of
multiple time statistics may lead to a more precise characterization of the underlying stochastic process.
It is well-known, that for the single time case a fractional diﬀusion equation can be derived, which determines the
pdf f(x, t),
ds h(s, t)f1(x, s)
as a solution of
∂tf(x, t) = 0D1−α
LF P f(x, t)
We would like to mention that a similar equation can be derived for the multiple times pdf f(x2, t2; x1, t1). This will
be discussed in a future publication. The present article is a starting point for the investigation of multiple times
pdf’s of the coupled Langevin equations of Fogedby.

APPENDIX A: FRACTIONAL DIFFERENTIAL OPERATOR
The Riemann-Liouville fractional integral is deﬁned as a generalization of the Cauchy formula to real orders α:
(t −t′)1−α dt′
Γ(α)tα−1 ∗g(t)
Here ∗denotes a Laplace convolution. Consequently performing the Laplace transformation is straightforward and
yields the well-known result:
g(t)} = λ−α˜g(λ)
¿From eq.(A1) the Riemann-Liouville fractional diﬀerential operator is obtained by simple partial derivation:
The extension of the fractional diﬀerential operator to two times t1,t2 is now obtained in a way analogous to the
steps above.
First we deﬁne the fractional integral operator of two times in Laplace-space:
:= (λ1 + λ2)−α˜g(λ1, λ2)
Furthermore the following equation holds:
dt2 e−λ1t1−λ2t2
δ(t2 −t1) =
dt1 e−t1(λ1+λ2)
= (λ1 + λ2)−α
In physical time the fractional integral operator can thus be considered as an expression containing a two-fold
Laplace convolution with respect to t1 and t2, denoted with ∗∗:
g(t1, t2) =
δ(t2 −t1) ∗∗g(t2, t1)
1) g(t2 −t′
Here we can distinguish between the cases t2 < t1 and t2 > t1 which results in eq.(47) The fractional diﬀerential
operator of two times is then corresponding to eq.(A3):
g(t1, t2) :=
In the general N-times case the fractional integral operator takes the form of an N-fold convolution
g(t1, ..., tN) =
δ(tN −tN−1)...δ(t2 −t1) ∗... ∗g(t1, ..., tN)
with Laplace-transform
g(t1, ..., tN)
˜g(λ1, ..., λN)
APPENDIX B: CALCULATION OF MOMENTS
Using the results of the previous section we can explicitly write the second order moment eq.(43) as convolution
integrals:
< s(t1)s(t2) > =
Γ(α + 1)(t1 −t′
Γ(α + 1)(t2 −t′
If we distinguish between the cases t2 > t1 and t1 > t2 in order to perform the integrations, we obtain:
< s(t1)s(t2) >
= Θ(t2 −t1)
Γ(2α + 1)t2α
Γ(α)Γ(α + 1)
dt′ t′α−1(t2 −t′)α
+Θ(t1 −t2)
Γ(2α + 1)t2α
Γ(α)Γ(α + 1)
dt′ t′α−1(t1 −t′)α
The integrals can be performed with Maple and lead to the hypergeometric function F(a, b; c; z):
dt′ t′α−1(t2 −t′)α = 1
