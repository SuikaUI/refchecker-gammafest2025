Abstract. Nowadays automatic disease detection has become a crucial issue in
medical science with the rapid growth of population. Coronavirus (COVID-19)
has become one of the most severe and acute diseases in very recent times that
has been spread globally. Automatic disease detection framework assists the doctors in the diagnosis of disease and provides exact, consistent, and fast reply as
well as reduces the death rate. Therefore, an automated detection system should
be implemented as the fastest way of diagnostic option to impede COVID-19
from spreading. This paper aims to introduce a deep learning technique based on
the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term
memory (LSTM) to diagnose COVID-19 automatically from X-ray images. In
this system, CNN is used for deep feature extraction and LSTM is used for detection using the extracted feature. A collection of 421 X-ray images including
141 images of COVID-19 is used as a dataset in this system. The experimental
results show that our proposed system has achieved 97% accuracy, 91% specificity, and 100% sensitivity. The system achieved desired results on a small dataset which can be further improved when more COVID-19 images become
available. The proposed system can assist doctors to diagnose and treatment the
COVID-19 patients easily.

Introduction
Coronavirus epidemic that spreads across the whole world has made all the process of
each sector lockdown. According to World Health Organization latest estimates, more
than seven million people around have been infected and close to 414,060 deaths so far
 . The health system has reached the point of failure even in
developed countries, due to the shortage of intensive care units (ICU). COVID-19 patients with worse conditions are filling in ICU. The strain that began to spread in Wuhan
of China, is identified from two different coronaviruses, i.e. severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) . Symptoms for

various types of COVID-19 can range from cold to fever, shortness of breath, and acute
respiratory symptoms . In comparison to SARS, the respiratory system is affected
by coronavirus as well as kidneys and liver .
Coronavirus detection at an early age plays a vital role to control COVID-19 due to the
high transmissibility. The diagnosis of coronavirus by gene sequencing for respiratory
or blood samples should be confirmed as the main pointer for reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) according to the guidelines of the Chinese government . The process of RT-PCR takes 4-6 hours to get results, which consumes a
long time compared to COVID-19's rapid spread rate. The RT-PCR test kits are in huge
shortage, in addition to inefficiency . As a result, many infected cases cannot be
detected on time and tend to unconsciously infect others. With the detection of this
disease at an early stage, the prevalence of COVID-19 disease will decrease . To
alleviate the inefficiency and scarcity of current COVID-19 tests, a lot of effort has
been placed into looking for alternative test methods. Another visualization method is
to diagnose COVID-19 infections using radiological images such as X-ray images or
Computed Tomography (CT). Earlier works show that the anomalies are found in
COVID-19 patients in the radiological images in the shape of ground-glass opacities
 . The researchers claim that a system based on chest radiology can be an important
method for identifying, quantifying, and monitoring of COVID-19 events . Today,
various researchers from all over the world are working to fight against COVID-19.
Many researchers demonstrate various approaches to detect COVID-19 utilizing X-ray
images. Recently, computer vision , machine learning , , , and deep
learning , have been used to automatically diagnose several diverse ailments
in the human body that ensures smart healthcare , . The deep learning method
is used as a feature extractor that enhances the classification accuracies . The detection of tumor forms and area in the lungs, X-ray bone suppression, diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, prostate segmentation, diagnosis of skin lesions, the examination of
the myocardium in coronary CT are the examples of the contributions , of deep
Therefore, this paper aims to propose a deep learning based system that combined the
CNN-LSTM network to automatically detect COVID-19 from X-ray images. The proposed system, for feature extraction, CNN is used and the LSTM is used to classify
COVID-19 based on these features. The 2D CNN and LSTM layout feature combination improve the classification greatly. The dataset used for this paper is collected from
multiple sources and a preprocessing performed in order to reduce the noise.
In the following, the contributions of this research are summarized.
a) Developing altogether a combined deep CNN-LSTM network to automatically assist the early diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 efficiently.
b) To detect COVID-19 using chest X-ray, a dataset is formed comprising 421 images.

With the epidemic of COVID-19, greater attempts have been done to evolve deep learning techniques to diagnose COVID-19 based on clinical images including Computer
Tomography (CT) scans and X-rays in the chest. In this literature, a detailed description

COVID-19 detection has outlined.

based on Xception and ResNet50V2 models using chest X-ray. The developed system
used a dataset contained 180 images with COVID-19 patients, 6054 images of pneumonia patients, and 8851 images from normal people. This work selected 633 images
in each phase for training and used eight phases. The experimental outcome has obtained 99.56% accuracy and 80.53% recall for COVID-19 cases. Alqudah et al.

224 images of COVID-19 patients, 700 images of pneumonia patients, and 504 images
of normal patients. The dataset is split using the concept of ten-fold cross-validation for
training and evaluation purposes. The VGG19 was selected as a main deep learning
model with 93.48% accuracy, 92.85% specificity, and 98.75% sensitivity in the developed system. Bandyopadhyay et al. proposed a novel model that combined the
LSTM-GRU to classify the confirmed, released, negative, and death cases on COVID-
19 automatically. The developed scheme achieved 87% accuracy on the confirmed
case, 67.8% accuracy on the negative case, 62% accuracy on the deceased case, and
40.5% accuracy on the released case for the prediction of COVID-19. Khan et al. 
presented a deep learning network to predict COVID-19 cases automatically from chest
X-ray. In the developed system, the dataset includes 284 images of COVID-19 cases,
330 images of pneumonia bacterial cases, 327 images of pneumonia viral cases, and
310 images of normal cases. The proposed system has obtained an overall 89.5% accuracy, 97% precision, and 100% recall respectively for COVID-19 cases.
Kumar et al. introduced a deep learning methodology for the classification of
COVID-19 infected patients using chest X-ray. The scheme used nine pre-trained models for the features extraction and support vector machine for the classification. They
prepared two sets of datasets containing 158 X-ray images for both COVID-19 and
non-COVID-19 patients. The ResNet50 plus SVM is statistically superior to other models with accuracy and the f1-score was 95.38%, 95.52% respectively. Horry et al. 
developed a system based on pre-trained model to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray.

patients. The dataset used in the system included 115 images of COVID-19 cases, 322
images of pneumonia cases, and 60361 images of normal cases. The results of around
80% both for recall and of precision both for VGG16 and VGG19 classifiers are appraised. Hemdan et al. introduced a deep learning technique to detect COVID-19
using X-ray images. The framework includes seven pre-trained models such as VGG19,
MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, ResNetV2, DenseNet201, Xception, and InceptionRes-
NetV2. In the developed system, 50 X-ray images are considered where 25 images from
COVID-19 infected patients and the rest 25 images from non-COVID-19 patients.
Among all tested classifiers, VGG19 and DenseNet201 models achieved the highest
values of 90% accuracy with 83% precision.
Methods and Materials
The overall system for the detection for COVID-19 requires several phases, which are
shown in Fig. 1. At first, raw X-ray images are passing through the preprocessing pipeline. Data resizing, shuffling, normalization, and augmentation process was done in the
preprocessing pipeline. Then, the preprocessed dataset is partitioned into a training set
and testing set. Afterward, we have trained CNN, and CNN-LSTM architecture using
the training dataset of the workflow. After each epoch, the training accuracy and loss
are found in the proposed system. At the same time, using 5-fold cross-validation the
validation accuracy and loss are also obtained. The performance is measured of some

Dataset Collection and description
As the emergence of COVID-19 being very recent, none of these large repositories
contains any COVID-19 labeled data, thereby requiring us to rely on at least two datasets for normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 source images. Firstly, 141 X-ray images
of COVID-19 cases are collected from GitHub developed by Joseph Paul Cohen .
Secondly, 140 X-ray images of pneumonia cases and 140 X-ray images of normal cases
are collected from the Kaggle repository . The main objective of this dataset selection is to make it available to the public so that it is accessible and extensible to researchers. Further studies may be more efficient to diagnose COVID-19 patients based
on this dataset. We resized the images to 224 x 224 pixels. The number of X-ray images
of each set is partitioned in Table 1. The visualization of X-ray images of each class is
shown in Fig. 2.
Development of Combined Network
The proposed architecture is formed with the combination of CNN and LSTM network
which is briefly described as follows.
3.2.1 Convolutional Neural Network
A particular type of multilayer perceptron is a convolutional neural network. However,
a simple neural network can not learn complex features but a deep architecture network
can learn it. On many applications , such as image classification, object detection, and medical image analysis, CNN's have shown excellent performance. The
main idea behind CNN is that it can obtain local features from higher layer inputs and
transfer them into lower layers for more complex features. CNN is comprised of a convolutional layer, pooling layer, and fully connected (FC) layer. A typical CNN architecture along with these layers is depicted in Fig. 3.

Data/Cases
The convolutional layer includes a set of kernels for determining a tensor of feature
maps. These kernels convolve entire input using "stride(s)" so that the dimensions of
the output volume become integers . The input volume’s dimensions reduce after
the convolutional layer for the striding process. Therefore, zero-padding is required to pad the input volume with zero’s to maintain the dimension of the input volume with low-level features. The operation of convolution layer is given as:
F (𝑖,) = (𝐼∗𝐾)(𝑖,𝑗) = ΣΣ 𝐼(𝑖+𝑚,𝑗+𝑛) 𝐾(𝑚,𝑛) (1)
where I refers to the input matrix, K refers to a 2D filter of size m x n, and F refers
output of the 2D feature map. The operation of the convolution layer is denoted by I*K.

second row are 4 sample images of pneumonia cases and the third row are 4 sample images of

For increasing the nonlinearity in the feature maps, the rectified linear unit (ReLU)
layer is used . ReLU computes the activation by keeping the threshold the input at
zero. It is mathematical expression is given as:
f(x) = max(0, x) (2)
The pooling layer is performed downsampling of the given input dimension to
reduce the number of parameters. Max Pooling is the most common method which
produces the maximum value in the input region. The fully-connected layer is used
as a classifier to make a decision based on obtained features from convolution and pooling layers. A full CNN architecture is developed with these layers which are discussed

3.2.2 Long Short-Term Memory
Long short-term memory is an improvement from the recurrent neural network (RNN).
LSTM proposes memory blocks instead of conventional RNN units to solve vanishing
and exploding gradient problem . LSTM added a cell state to save long-term states
which is the main difference from RNN. LSTM network can remember and connect the
previous information to the present . The structure of the LSTM network is shown
in Fig. 4. The LSTM is combined with three gates such as the input gate, the forget gate
and the output gate where 𝑥𝑡 refers the current input, 𝐶t and 𝐶𝑡−1 refer the new and
previous cell state respectively, ht and ℎ𝑡−1 refer the current and previous output respectively.
The principle of the input gate of the LSTM is shown in the following forms.
i𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊i ⋅ [ℎ𝑡−1, 𝑥𝑡] + 𝑏i ) (3)
𝐶̃𝑡 = tanh(𝑊i ⋅ [ℎ𝑡−1, 𝑥𝑡] + 𝑏i ) (4)
𝐶t = 𝑓𝑡 𝐶𝑡−1 + 𝑖𝑡 𝐶̃𝑡 (5)

where (3) is used to pass ℎ𝑡−1 and 𝑥𝑡 through the sigmoid layer to decide which portion
of information should be added. Subsequently, (4) obtains new information after passing ℎ𝑡−1 and 𝑥𝑡 through the tanh layer. The current moment information 𝐶̃𝑡 and longterm memory information 𝐶𝑡−1 into 𝐶t are combined in (5), where 𝑖𝑡 refers to sigmoid
output, and 𝐶̃𝑡 refers to tanh output. Here, Wi refers to weight matrices and bi refers to
input gate bias of LSTM. Then, the LSTM's forget gate allows the selective passage of
information using a sigmoid layer and a dot product. The decision about whether to
forget from the previous cell's related information with a certain probability is done
using (6) where Wf refers to the weight matrix, bf is the offset, and σ refers to the sigmoid function.
f𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊f ⋅ [ℎ𝑡−1, 𝑥𝑡] + 𝑏f ) (6)
The LSTM’s output gate determines the states which are required to be continued by
the ℎ𝑡−1 and 𝑥𝑡 inputs following to (7) and (8). The final output is obtained to multiply
with the state decision vectors passing new information Ct through the tanh layer.
𝑂t = 𝜎(𝑊𝑂 ⋅ [ ℎ𝑡−1, 𝑥𝑡] + 𝑏𝑂 ) (7)
ℎt = 𝑂𝑡 tanh(𝐶𝑡) (8)
where 𝑊o and 𝑏o are the output gate’s weighted matrices and the output gate’s bias of
LSTM respectively.

In this paper, a combined method was developed to automatically detect the COVID-
19 cases using three types of X-ray images. The structure of this architecture is developed by combining CNN and LSTM networks where CNN is used to extract the complex features from images and LSTM is used as a classifier.
Fig. 5 illustrates the proposed hybrid network for COVID-19 detection. Each convolution block combined with two or three 2D CNN and one pooling layer; the rectified
linear units are activated as an activation function. The convolution kernel is extracted
convolution feature by multiplying the superposition matrix in all convolution operations. The maximum-pooled filter of the feature map is used for feature extraction after
a two-dimensional convolution, and the filter's step size is two. In the last part of the
architecture, the function map is transferred to the LSTM layer to extract time information. Finally, the fully connected layer of the softmax function is used to predict into
three categories (COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal).

Experimental Results Analysis
4.1 Experimental Setup
In the experiment, the dataset was split into 85% and 15% for training and testing respectively. Using k-fold cross-validation, results were obtained according to 5 different
k values such as (k=1-5). The proposed network consists of twelve layers as described
in Table 2, the learning rate is 0.0001, and the maximum epochs number is 200 which
were determined experimentally. The CNN and CNN-LSTM networks have been implemented using Python and the Keras package with TensorFlow2 on Intel(R)
Core(TM) i7-2.2 GHz processor. Besides, the experiments were executed using the
graphical processing unit (GPU) NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti and RAM with 4 GB and
16GB, respectively.
Results Analysis
Fig. 6 depicts the confusion matrix of the test phase of the proposed CNN-LSTM and
the competitive CNN architecture for COVID-19 disease classification. Though both
architectures classify all 22 images of COVID-19 perfectly, there are four misclassified
images for CNN and two misclassified images for CNN-LSTM among 64 images. It is
found that the proposed CNN-LSTM network outperforms the competitive CNN network as it has better, and consistent true positive and true negative values and lesser
false-negative and false-positive values. Hence, the proposed system can efficiently
classify COVID-19 cases.
Moreover, Fig. 7 illustrates the performance evaluation of the CNN classifier graphically with accuracy and cross-entropy (loss) in the training and validation phase. The
training and validation accuracy is found at 92% and 95% respectively. Similarly, the
training and validation loss are found 0.18 and 0.09 respectively for the CNN architecture.
Further, Fig. 8 depicts the performance evaluation of the CNN-LSTM classifier graphically with accuracy and cross-entropy (loss) in the training and validation phase. The
training and validation accuracy is found 95% and 98% respectively. Similarly, the
training and validation loss are found 0.18 and 0.04 respectively for the CNN-LSTM
architecture. The best scores of training and validation accuracy were achieved for the
CNN-LSTM architecture comparing with the CNN architecture.

By analyzing the results, it is demonstrated that a combination of CNN and LSTM has
significant effects on the detection of COVID-19 based on the automatic extraction of
features from X-ray images. The proposed system could distinguish COVID-19 from
pneumonia and normal cases with high accuracy. A comparative study of systems with
our proposed CNN-LSTM system is shown in Table 5. From Table 5, it is found that

Conclusion
The COVID-19 cases are increasing daily, many countries face resource shortages.
Hence, it is necessary to identify every single positive case during this health emergency. We introduced a deep CNN-LSTM network for the detection of novel COVID-
19 from X-ray images. Here, CNN is used as a feature extractor and the LSTM network
as a classifier for the detection of coronavirus. The developed system obtained an overall 97% accuracy for all cases and 100% accuracy for COVID-19 cases. The proposed
CNN-LSTM and competitive CNN architecture are applied both on the same dataset.
The extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed architecture outperforms
competitive CNN network. In these global COVID-19 pandemics, we hope that the
proposed system would able to develop a tool for COVID-19 patients and reduce the
workload of the medical diagnosis for COVID-19.
The limited number of COVID-19 X-ray images is the main limitation of this study
which would be overcome if more images are found in the coming days.
