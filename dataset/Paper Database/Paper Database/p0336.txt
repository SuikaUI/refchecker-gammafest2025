Water molecules play an important role in providing unique environments for biological reactions on cell
membranes. It is widely believed that water molecules form bridges that connect lipid molecules and
stabilize cell membranes. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show that translational and
rotational diffusion of water molecules on lipid membrane surfaces exhibit subdiffusion and aging.
Moreover, we provide evidence that both divergent mean trapping time (continuous-time random walk)
and long-correlated noise (fractional Brownian motion) contribute to this subdiffusion. These results
suggest that subdiffusion on cell membranes causes the water retardation, an enhancement of cell
membrane stability, and a higher reaction efficiency.
ater molecules around cell membranes are important for stability and dynamics of self-assembled lipid
structures. Such water molecules form a bridge network that connects lipid molecules1. Water molecules form local hydration structures depending on the lipid head groups2–4 and are weakly aligned by
charges on the lipid head group5–8. Thus, it is difficult for water molecules to diffuse freely on the surface of the
membranes. Qualitatively, translational and rotational motions of water molecules near membranes are slower
than those in the bulk9–12. Although static properties of such water molecules have been known from experiments,
little is known about how water molecules actually diffuse on the membrane surface.
In usual case, diffusion can be characterized by the ensemble-averaged mean square displacement (MSD), i.e.,
Ær2(t)æ 5 2Dt, where D is the diffusion constant. However, extensive experimental studies show subdiffusion,
where a is the subdiffusive exponent and Ka is the generalized diffusion constant. There are three well-known
stochastic models of subdiffusions with different mechanisms: fractional Brownian motion (FBM)13,14, diffusion
on a fractal lattice15, and continuous-time random walk (CTRW)16. Because these models have different physical
nature, revealing the origin is significant to understand physical properties17,18. In particular, the physical origin of
subdiffusion in living cells has been extensively studied19–23. Previously, water molecules near the surface of lipid
membranes were found to show transient subdiffusion24,25, and water molecules exhibit subdiffusion on the
surfaces12. However, the origin of this water subdiffusion remains unclear.
In general, it is difficult to identify the mechanism underlying subdiffusion. Ergodic and aging properties play
an important role in clarifying the physical origin. It is known that FBM motion is ergodic, whereas under
confinement a power-law relaxation of time-averaged mean square displacement occurs for a model related to
FBM26,27. Since ordinary ergodicity, where the time averages are equal to the ensemble average, holds for FBM,
and diffusion on a fractal lattice28,29, the dominant feature of CTRW with a divergent mean trapping time is aging
and weak ergodicity breaking30–33. Such phenomena are also observed in a range of stochastic models different
from the CTRW such as random walk with static disorder34, random walks with correlated waiting times35,36,
spatially correlated random walks37, aging walks38, and stored-energy-driven Le´vy flight39.
Divergence of the mean trapping time is attributed to a power law in the trapping-time distribution. Power laws
are often observed in biological phenomena21,40–42. One of the mechanisms generating a power-law trapping-time
distribution is a random-energy landscape30. There are many binding sites in one-dimensional diffusion along
DNA, two-dimensional diffusion on the plasma membrane, and three-dimensional diffusion in the cytoplasm43.
If the potential depth of each binding site is randomly distributed according to the exponential distribution, the
distribution of the trapping times for which particles are trapped in the binding sites follows a power law44.
Here, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on two systems of water molecules plus membranes,
of either palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphocholine (POPC) or palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), at

the temperature 310 K to investigate the diffusion of water molecules
on the membrane surface (Fig. 1A). Here, we report on subdiffusion
of water molecules on the membrane surfaces. Furthermore, we show
that the subdiffusion is attributed to the divergent mean trapping
time and anti-correlated noise, i.e., a combination of CTRW and
FBM scenarios. We confirm there are no qualitative differences
about subdiffusive behavior despite of the different water structure
at ammonium head groups of POPC and POPE2.
Diffusions of water molecules on membrane surfaces. Water
molecules forming the bridges connecting lipid molecules on the
membrane surface do not diffuse. This bridge is formed by
hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and head groups of
the lipid molecules. These hydrogen bond interactions create a
complicated and random potential surface over the membrane. To
investigate the diffusivity of water molecules on the membrane
surfaces, we define surface water molecules as water molecules for
which the oxygens remain continuously within interatomic distances
of 0.35 nm from atoms (oxygen, phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon
atoms) in the lipid molecules. In what follows, we use trajectories of
the water and lipid molecules where the position of the center of mass
of the membrane is subtracted.
First, we consider the survival probability of residence time of
water molecules on the membrane surface, where the residence time
is defined as the duration for which a water molecule remains on
the membrane surface. The survival provability is defined by
ð Þdt0, where P(t) is a probability density function
(PDF). The PDFs of the residence times follow power-law distributions with exponential cutoffs in their tails (see Fig. S2). Mean residence times on POPC and POPE bilayers are 7.0 6 36 ps and 9.3 6
42 ps, respectively. Although almost all of the water molecules pass
on the membrane surfaces without binding to the lipid molecules, we
are interested in the water molecules diffusing on lipid membrane
surfaces. This is because water molecules residing on the surface for
long time can contribute to membrane stability by making water
bridges and may have important role in many physiological
processes.
Figure 1C shows a lateral trajectory of a water molecule residing on
the POPE bilayer surface for 9 ns. Surprisingly, water molecules do
diffuse widely on the membrane surface while residing on it. In other
words, water bridges connecting lipid molecules are not static but
dynamical. Indeed, diffusion distances on the membrane surface
lengthen with increasing residence times. Figure 1D shows the probability that the maximal excursion distance for water molecules is
greater than lc, Pr r2
max tð Þw2l2
, where the maximal excursion distance is defined by rmax(t) 5 max{r(t9): 0 # t9 # t} with
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
x tð Þ2zy tð Þ2
. About 40% of water molecules that reside on
the membrane surface over 600 ps can diffuse above 0.5 nm2. This
implies that water molecules can diffuse beyond a lipid molecule in
the membranes, because the area per lipid is about 0.5–0.7 nm2.
Some water molecules diffuse by interchanging the water bridge
while remaining on the membrane surface. Thus, we found a
water-bridge interchange dynamics for the first time.
Translational and rotational subdiffusion of water molecules. To
investigate the diffusion of water molecules on the membrane
surfaces, we consider translational as well as rotational diffusions
of the water molecules. The ensemble-averaged lateral translational
MSD (tMSD) is defined as

where t0 is the time when water molecules enter the membrane
surfaces and Æ…æ is the average with respect to captured and
reflected the water molecules impinging on the membrane
surfaces. If exiting from the membrane surfaces, water molecules
are excluded from the ensemble. In considering rotational
diffusion, we define dh tð Þ~cos{1 ~m tð Þ:~m tzdt
Þ and direction
~p tð Þ:~m tð Þ|~m tzdt

(rMSD)45 is given by
~ ~Q tð Þ{~Q 0
In CTRW, the MSD is suppressed with increase of the starting time t1
of a measurement46. This behavior is called aging. To investigate
aging, we consider the dependence of the MSDs on the starting
time of a measurement. Here, we consider tMSD(t; t1) 5 Æ{x(t 1 t0
1 t1) 2 x(t0 1 t1)}2 1 {y(t 1 t0 1 t1) 2 y(t0 1 t1)}2æ/2 and

Þ{~Q t0zt1
, where t1 corresponds
to times after entering the membrane surface at t0. Figure 2 shows
the MSDs measured after time t1 from 0 to 200 ps. Translational
motions of water molecules exhibit subdiffusion as in diffusion of
lipid molecules42,47–50. Whereas the subdiffusive exponents in the
tMSDs decrease as time t increases, the rMSDs show subdiffusion
with a constant subdiffusive exponent. For tMSD and rMSD, water
molecules on POPC bilayers are faster than those on POPE bilayers.
This is because hydrogen bonds between choline groups and water
molecules in POPC bilayers are weaker than those in POPE bilayers
because methyl groups are present in the choline group of POPC.
Moreover, as seen in Fig. 2, both tMSD and rMSD depend on the
starting time of a measurement t1. Both MSDs become smaller the
later t1 becomes. For t1 . 50 ps, unlike CTRW, MSDs do not
strongly depend on t1. Therefore, this aging will be affected by a
non-equilibrium initial condition when water molecules attach to
the membrane surfaces. We note that MSDs show aging even
when non-equilibrium initial conditions are skipped (see Fig. S3).
Origin of subdiffusive motion of water molecules. To clarify the
origin of subdiffusive motions of water molecules on membrane
surfaces, we perform a mean maximal excursion (MME) analysis18.
The MME analysis provides us an information on the physical nature
of the underlying subdiffusive processes by using trajectories only. In
Fig. 3A, the translational and rotational MSDs, Æl2(t)æ and ÆQ2(t)æ,
and the MME second moments, Æl2(t)maxæ and ÆQ2(t)maxæ, grow
sublinearly with time, where Æl2(t)maxæ and ÆQ2(t)maxæ are the
ensemble averages of lmax(t) 5 max{l(t9): 0 # t9 # t} and Qmax(t)
5 max{Q(t9): 0 # t9 # t}, respectively. For about t . 30 ps, the
subdiffusive exponents of MSDs are almost the same as those of
the MME second moment. This result suggests that a fractal or
relatively
large-time
intervals.
Moreover, Fig. 3B shows that the regular moment ratios Æl4(t)æ/
Æl2(t)æ2 and ÆQ4(t)æ/ÆQ2(t)æ2 fluctuate above 2 except for ÆQ4(t)æ/
ÆQ2(t)æ2 around 1000 ps and that the MME moment ratios
Æl4(t)maxæ/Æl2(t)maxæ2 and ÆQ4(t)maxæ/ÆQ2(t)maxæ2 fluctuate above 1.49.
This result suggests CTRW scenario and excludes FBM and fractal
scenarios. Figure 3C shows that the probability for water molecules
to be in a sphere of growing radius r0ta/2 is almost constant over t,
while for rotational diffusions, the probability below 20 ps increases
because of a change in the subdiffusive exponent. This result suggests
CTRW or FBM scenarios and excludes fractal scenario. The above
results are summarized in Table 1. These results strongly support the
CTRW scenario for large-time intervals.

To validate the CTRW scenario, we consider the time-averaged mean
square displacements (TAMSDs) defined by d2 D; t
translational and rotational motions, respectively, where t is the
measurement time and d2
Þ. TAMSDs for trajectories of water molecules residing on
the surface of the membrane longer than 2000 ps for both translational and rotational motions are shown in Figs. 4A and 4B,
respectively. Unlike CTRW, where the TAMSD grows linearly with
D, TAMSDs do not show a linear scaling over short-time durations.
Because the TAMSD shows subdiffusion in FBM, i.e., sublinear scaling of D, translational and rotational motions have a FBM characteristic over short-time durations of D. However, rotational TAMSDs
show normal diffusion (linear scaling of D) as expected by CTRW,
whereas translational TAMSDs do not show normal diffusion. The
mean rotational TAMSDs crossover from sublinear to linear (see Fig.
S5). The crossover points at around 10 ps are coincident with the
relaxation time for the orientational correlation functions of water
molecules on the membrane surfaces12. Because the sublinear growth
of the TAMSDs suggests FBM, the dynamics of water molecules will
be affected by viscoelasticity.
Figures 4C and 4D show the aging plots for translational and
rotational TAMSDs on the POPC membrane surface, i.e., the
ensemble average of the TAMSD as a function of the measurement
time t, for different measurement starting times t1. Whereas the
ensemble averages of translational and rotational TAMSDs show
power-law decays: d2 D; t
!t{c2 for t1 ,
50 ps, those do not decay for t1 . 50 ps. In CTRW, the ensemble
average of a TAMSD decays as d2 D; t
Þ31, where a is the
power-law exponent for the trapping-time PDF. However, recently,
it is shown that CTRW with strong noisy fluctuations do not show
the aging of TAMSD, whereas MSD still shows aging51. Thus, the
power-law decays of ensemble average of TAMSDs for t1 , 50 ps are
attributed to non-equilibrium initial conditions of water molecules
on the membrane surfaces. This is because mean velocity of bulk
water molecules is higher than those on the membrane surfaces. We
note that MSDs show aging in our simulations even when an initial
non-equilibrium state is skipped (see Fig. S3).
Together with the MME analysis, it is physically reasonable to
consider that the origin of the observed subdiffusion is a combination
of CTRW and FBM. Although we do not provide a direct evidence of
aging effect, results in noisy CTRW51 assist a suggestion that aging
due to CTRW is inherent in water dynamics on the membrane

surfaces. We note that non-equilibrium conditions of water molecules on the membrane surface are compatible with an equilibration
of the total system. As shown in the supporting information (Fig. S11,
S12), total systems are equilibrated whereas TAMSDs show apparent
aging (see aging plot in Fig. 4). This apparent inconsistency can be
resolved by dissociation of water molecules from the membrane
surfaces. In fact, because water molecules can dissociate from the
membrane surfaces and the mean residence time is finite, the system
can be equilibrated.
The distribution of waiting times contributes to CTRW arising
from random binding and unbinding of water molecules from the
lipid surface. Moreover, translational motions of water molecules
forming the water bridge are affected by lipid motions in lipid membranes which are governed by FBM motions42,49,50. Unlike CTRW,
where a trapped state simply does not move, it is difficult to estimate
exact trapping times in such situations. Thus, we do not observe
power-law trapping-time distributions in lateral motions (see Fig.
S8) because water molecules on the membrane surface can move
during a trapped state. We also confirmed that there are no significant differences in the water behavior on both POPC and POPE lipid
membranes (see Fig. S3–S9). Subdiffusion and aging are also
observed with using other force filed, thermostat, and barostat (see
Fig. S10, the detail of MD simulations is written in our previous
Discussion
In summary, we have shown that water molecules on membrane
surfaces can diffuse laterally while connected as part of a bridging
network to lipid molecules in membrane. This interchanging
dynamics in the water bridge network can be described by CTRW.
Furthermore, we have found translational and rotational subdiffusion of water molecules on the membrane surfaces. These subdiffusions originate from a combination of CTRW and FBM, which are
attributed to long-time trapping by the membrane surface and
viscoelasticity of lipid bilayers, respectively. Such a subdiffusive process has been observed in experiments of intracellular transport of
insulin granules23.
What is a biological significance of subdiffusion and aging phenomena of water molecules on cell membrane surfaces? Because
subdiffusion and aging mean the diffusivity decreases as time passes,
these phenomena cause water retardation and increase the chance of
water binding on the membrane surfaces. As a result, water molecules form bridges that connect lipid molecules and stabilize cell
membranes. Moreover, the water retardation may contribute to
higher efficiency of biological reactions on cell membranes. To
recognize and bind to a target, biomolecules diffuse slowly around
the target, and may be guided by the behavior of water molecules
in the target vicinity52. For example, water retardation around a
metalloenzyme active site assists enzyme-substrate interactions53.
In a stochastic model, the probability of finding a nearby target is
explicitly increased by subdiffusion54. Biological reactions such as
ligand-receptor interactions and enzymatic reactions occur on cell
membranes. Those depend upon encounters between biomolecules, and the structure and dynamics of water molecules in the
hydration layer on the membranes. The water environment around
the cell membranes produced by the anomalous diffusion of water
molecules may have biological significance.
MD simulations. To clarify water molecule dynamics on the lipid membrane surface,
MD simulations of pure POPC or POPE bilayers were performed. Each lipid bilayer
system consisted of 128 lipids (64 for each leaflet) and 7,680 TIP3P water molecules
(see Fig. 1(A)). The CHARMM3655 force field was used for the lipids. The TIP3P
water model modified for the CHARMM force field56 was used because the
CHARMM36 force field was developed based on the TIP3P water models. Although
the diffusion constant of TIP3P water model is higher than the experimental values, it
reproduces the first-shell hydration and the energetics of liquid water57. The bond
lengths involving the hydrogen atoms were constrained to equilibrium lengths using
the SHAKE method. The direct sum and Lennard-Jones interactions were smoothly
truncated at a cutoff distance of 1.2 nm, using a switching function that becomes
effective at 1.0 nm. The particle-mesh Ewald method was used for calculations of

electrostatic interactions. Before MD simulations, energy minimization was
performed using a conjugate gradient algorithm to remove the bad contacts of the
initial configuration. Simulations were performed under constant NPT (number of
particles, pressure, and temperature) with temperature 310 K and pressure 0.1 MPa.
For temperature and pressure control, a Langevin thermostat and piston were used
with a damping coefficient of 1 ps21 and a collision period of 0.2 ps, respectively.
The three orthogonal dimensions of the periodic cell were allowed to change
independently. Each simulation ran for 240 ns under 2.0 fs time-step increments;
coordinates were recorded every 1.0 ps. The final system sizes of MD simulations of
POPC and POPE bilayers are 6.6 3 6.6 3 8.8 nm3 and 6.1 3 6.1 3 10.2 nm3,
respectively. The properties of each system were analyzed over the trajectories of the
final 130 ns of each system. All MD simulations were performed using NAMD2.9
software58.
