Abstract. Feature selection is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. For
instance in bioinformatics, it is essential when one wishes to detect biomarkers.
Tree-based methods are predominantly used for this purpose. In this paper, we study
the stability of the feature selection methods BORUTA, VITA, and RRF
(regularized random forest). In particular, we investigate the feature ranking
instability of the associated stochastic algorithms. For stabilization of the feature
ranks, we propose to compute consensus values from multiple feature selection runs,
applying rank aggregation techniques. Our results show that these consolidated
features are more accurate and robust, which helps to make practical machine
learning applications more trustworthy.

1. Motivation
Feature selection is an important preprocessing step in many machine learning
applications and has long been a fundamental challenge. In the biomedical field, feature
selection is commonly used for data-driven biomarker discovery. Most common feature
selection methods are based on the random forest (RF) classifier because it provides an
interpretable mechanism for computing feature importance. Very important aspects of
trustworthy AI are robustness and explainability . A robust feature selector should (1)
report on a constant set of relevant features when executed on exactly the same data set
multiple times (stability), and (2) select the most relevant features for the modeling
process of interest. In this work we analyzed the robustness of three feature selection
methods which are widely used for data-driven biomarker discovery, namely the
BORUTA algorithm , the VITA algorithm , and the RRF algorithm . In essence,
we are proposing to run the above mentioned algorithms multiple times and to
consolidate the observed rank variations of importance scores through rank aggregation
techniques. In simulation experiments on synthetic data we could show, that the RF
consensus feature ranks obtained via rank aggregation can substantially improve the
selection of the most important and best performing features.

2. Results
For evaluation we used the Madelon data sets from the the UCI Machine Learning
Repository ( Madelon is synthetic and
contains data points grouped in 32 clusters placed on the vertices of a five-dimensional
hypercube randomly labeled +1 or -1. Madelon includes 20 relevant and 480 irrelevant
features. The performance of the feature selection algorithms was analyzed while subsequentially down-sampling the data (15%, 25%, 50%, and 75%), leading to a stepwise
reduction of the relevant signals. The feature selection algorithms were executed 20 times
on exactly the same down-sampled data set. The rank aggregation techniques Borda
(l2norm, mean, geometric mean, and median; ) and alternatively RRA were
applied for the consensus calculations. To evaluate the stability of the feature selectors
coverage was used, defined as Rs/Rt, where Rs is the number of relevant features which
are successfully selected and Rt is the total number of relevant features present in the
data. The analysis of the Madelon data set indicates that VITA as well as BORUTA can
be improved by consolidated consensus scores. When only 25% of the data are randomly
sampled, the overall performance and robustness decreases. A detailed summary of this
evaluation can be obtained from Table 1, where we also varied the number of trees within
the RF. We observe that for BORUTA and VITA, the consolidated consensus ranks have
a much higher coverage compared to the median coverage of the 20 feature selection
runs. This observation indicates that the consensus calculation may have a higher impact
on robustness than an increased number of trees. Even for a number of trees as high as
1000, there is a notable difference in performance between the worst (min coverage) and
the best (max coverage) run. Furthermore, we identify BORUTA as the most accurate
algorithm, especially when the number of trees is low and the signal is weak. However,
it is computationally more demanding than VITA. Compared to BORUTA and VITA,
RRF does not benefit much from the consensus calculations.
