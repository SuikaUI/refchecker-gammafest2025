LncRNA-protein interactions play important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation,
poly-adenylation, splicing and translation. Identification of lncRNA-protein interactions helps
to understand lncRNA-related activities. Existing computational methods utilize multiple
lncRNA features or multiple protein features to predict lncRNA-protein interactions, but features are not available for all lncRNAs or proteins; most of existing methods are not capable
of predicting interacting proteins (or lncRNAs) for new lncRNAs (or proteins), which don’t
have known interactions. In this paper, we propose the sequence-based feature projection
ensemble learning method, “SFPEL-LPI”, to predict lncRNA-protein interactions. First,
SFPEL-LPI extracts lncRNA sequence-based features and protein sequence-based features. Second, SFPEL-LPI calculates multiple lncRNA-lncRNA similarities and protein-protein similarities by using lncRNA sequences, protein sequences and known lncRNA-protein
interactions. Then, SFPEL-LPI combines multiple similarities and multiple features with a
feature projection ensemble learning frame. In computational experiments, SFPEL-LPI
accurately predicts lncRNA-protein associations and outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods. More importantly, SFPEL-LPI can be applied to new lncRNAs (or proteins). The
case studies demonstrate that our method can find out novel lncRNA-protein interactions,
which are confirmed by literature. Finally, we construct a user-friendly web server, available

Introduction
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of transcribed RNA molecules with a length of
more than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins . Since lncRNAs are involved in
important biological regulations , lncRNAs have gained widespread attention. Studies
 revealed that lncRNAs can interact with proteins, and then activate post-transcriptional
gene regulation, poly-adenylation, splicing and translation. Identification of lncRNA-protein
interactions helps to understand lncRNAs’ functions. There exist a large number of unexplored lncRNAs and proteins, which makes it impossible to examine their interactions efficiently and effectively through wet experiments.
In recent years, many computational methods have been proposed to predict lncRNA-protein interactions, in order to screen lncRNA-protein interactions and guide wet experiments.
There are two types of computational methods: binary classification methods and semi-supervised learning methods. The binary classification methods take known interacting lncRNAprotein pairs as positive instances and non-interacting pairs as negative instances, and build
binary classification-based models. Muppirala et al. adopted the k-mer composition to
encode RNA sequences and protein sequences, and used SVM and random forest to build prediction models. Wang et al. used RNA-protein interactions as positive instances, and randomly selected twice number of protein-RNA pairs without interaction information as
negative samples, and then built prediction models by using naive Bayes. Suresh et al. proposed a support vector machine-based predictor “RPI-Pred” to predict protein-RNA interactions based on their sequences and structures. Xiao et al. used the HeteSim measure to
score lncRNA-protein pairs, and then built an SVM classifier based on HeteSim scores. However, binary classification-based methods are influenced by the imbalance ratio between positive instances and negative instances, and how to select high-quality negative instances is
challenging. Semi-supervised learning methods formulate the lncRNA-protein interaction
prediction as semi-supervised learning tasks. Lu et al. used matrix multiplication to score
each RNA-protein pair for prediction. Li et al. proposed a heterogeneous network-based
method “LPIHN”, which integrated the lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network, the lncRNA-protein interaction network and the protein-protein interaction network. Then, a random walk
with restart was implemented on the heterogeneous network to infer lncRNA-protein interactions. Yang et al. proposed the Hetesim algorithm, which can predict lncRNA-protein
relation based on the heterogeneous lncRNA-protein network. Ge et al. proposed a
computational method “LPBNI” based on the lncRNA-protein bipartite network inference.

Competing interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist.
Zheng et al. constructed multiple protein-protein similarity networks to predict lncRNAprotein interactions. Zhang et al. employed KATZ measure to calculate similarities
between lncRNAs and proteins in a global network, which were constructed based on
lncRNA-lncRNA similarity, lncRNA-protein associations and protein-protein interactions.
Hu et al. presented the eigenvalue transformation-based semi-supervised link prediction
method “LPI-ETSLP”. Zhang et al. proposed a linear neighborhood propagation method
(LPLNP) by combining interaction profiles, expression profiles, sequence composition of
lncRNAs and interaction profile, CTD feature of proteins. Moreover, there are related works
about the DNA-protein binding prediction .
Existing computational methods utilize diverse lncRNA features and protein features, but
features are not available for all lncRNAs or proteins, and these methods cannot work when
information is unavailable. In addition, many lncRNAs (or proteins) don’t have known interactions with any protein (or lncRNA), and we name them as new lncRNAs (or proteins). Most
existing methods are not capable of predicting interacting proteins (or lncRNAs) for new
lncRNAs (or proteins).
In this paper, we propose the sequence-based feature projection ensemble learning method,
“SFPEL-LPI”, to predict lncRNA-protein interactions. First, SFPEL-LPI extracts lncRNA
sequence-based features and protein sequence-based features. Second, SFPEL-LPI calculates
multiple lncRNA-lncRNA similarities and protein-protein similarities by using lncRNA
sequences, protein sequences and known lncRNA-protein interactions. Then, SFPEL-LPI
combines multiple similarities and multiple features with a feature projection ensemble learning frame. Computational experiments demonstrate that SFPEL-LPI predicts lncRNA-protein
associations accurately and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. More importantly,
SFPEL-LPI can be applied to new lncRNAs (or proteins). The case studies demonstrate that
our method can find out novel lncRNA-protein interactions.
Materials and methods
Several databases facilitate the lncRNA-protein interaction prediction. NPInter database 
includes experimental interactions among non-coding RNA and biomolecules (i.e. proteins,
genomic DNAs and RNAs). NONCODE is an integrated information resource for non-coding
RNAs. SUPERFAMILY is a database of structural and functional annotation for all proteins and genomes. As far as we know, lncRNA-protein interactions from NPInter v2.0 database were widely used in related studies . Based on NPInter v2.0 interactions, we
compiled a dataset containing 4158 lncRNA-protein interactions between 990 lncRNAs and
27 proteins. Moreover, we collected the sequences of these lncRNAs and proteins from NON-
CODE and SUPERFAMILY respectively. We adopt NPInter v2.0 dataset as the benchmark
dataset to test the performances of prediction models.
Here, we introduce notations about the dataset. Given a set of lncRNAs L ¼ fL1; L2;    ; Lsg
and a set of proteins P ¼ fP1; P2;    ; Ptg, known lncRNA-protein interactions can be represented by an s×t interaction matrix Y, where Yij = 1 if the lncRNA Li interacts with the protein Pj,
otherwise Yij = 1.
Features for lncRNAs and proteins
In this section, we describe two lncRNA features and two protein features, based on lncRNA
sequences, protein sequences and known lncRNA-protein interactions. On one hand, a great
number of features can be extracted from lncRNAs sequences and proteins sequences,
and feature-extraction tools such as Pse-in-One , BioSeq-Analysis , repRNA ,

iMiRNA-PseDPC and UltraPse have been available. One the other hand, known
lncRNA-protein interactions can bring features to describe lncRNAs and proteins.
LncRNA features.
The pseudo dinucleotide composition (PseDNC) describes the
contiguous local sequence-order information and the global sequence-order information of
lncRNAs. The pseudo dinucleotide composition has several variants, and we use the parallel
correlation pseudo dinucleotide composition, which contains the occurrences of different
dinucleotides and the physicochemical properties of dinucleotides. The PseDNC feature vector
of an RNA sequence L is defined as:
L ¼ ½d1; d2;    ; d16; d16þ1;    ; d16þt
i¼1 fi þ w Pt
1  k  16
i¼1 fi þ w Pt
17  k  16 þ t
where fk is the normalized occurrence frequency of dinucleotide in the RNA sequence L; the
parameter τ is an integer, representing the highest counted rank of the correlation along an
RNA sequence; w is the weight factor ranging from 0 to 1; θj is the j-tier correlation factor
reflecting the sequence-order correlation between all the j-th most contiguous dinucleotides
along an RNA sequence. We obtain PseDNC feature vectors of lncRNAs by using the python
package "repDNA”, and more details about PseDNC are described in .
Moreover, we define the interaction profiles (IP) of lncRNAs based on known lncRNA-protein interactions. For a lncRNA Li, its interaction profile is a binary vector encoding the presence or absence of interactions with every protein, denoted as IPLi. Actually, the interaction
profile of a lncRNA corresponds to a row vector of the interaction matrix Y, IPLi ¼ Yði; :Þ.
Protein features.
The pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) describes the
amino acid composition and the sequence-order information of proteins, and has been widely
used for tasks in bioinformatics. PseAAC contains 20 components reflecting the occurrence
frequency of amino acids in a protein as well as the additional factors reflecting sequenceorder information. Thus, we use PseAAC as a feature to represent proteins. There are several
variants of PseAAC, and we adopt the parallel correlation pseudo amino acid composition.
The PseAAC feature vector of a protein sequence P is defined as:
P ¼ ½x1; x2;    ; x20; x20þ1;    ; x20þt
i¼1 fi þ w Pt
1  u  20
i¼1 fi þ w Pt
21  u  20 þ t
where fi is the normalized occurrence frequency of the 20 amino acids in the protein sequence
P; the parameter τ is an integer, representing the highest counted rank of the correlation along
a protein sequence; w is the weight factor ranging from 0 to 1; θj is the j-tier correlation factor
reflecting the sequence-order correlation between all the j-th most contiguous residues along a

protein sequence. We obtain the PseAAC feature vectors of proteins by using web server “Psein-One”, and more details are described in .
Similar to the lncRNA interaction profiles, the protein interaction profile (IP) of a protein
Pi is a binary vector specifying the presence or absence of interactions with every lncRNAs,
denoted as IPpi. The interaction profile of a protein corresponds to a column vector of the
interaction matrix Y, IPpi ¼ Yð:; iÞ.
Similarities for lncRNAs and proteins
In this section, we describe three lncRNA-lncRNA similarities and three protein-protein
similarities.
LncRNA-lncRNA similarities.
As introduced in Section “LncRNA features”, we have two
lncRNA features: PseDNC and IP, and thus use them to calculate two types of lncRNAlncRNA similarities. There are different approaches to calculate similarity based on feature
vectors, such as Jaccard similarity, Gauss similarity and cosine similarity. Here, we adopt the
linear neighborhood similarity (LNS), which has been proposed in our previous work and successfully applied to many bioinformatics problems .
Moreover, we define the Smith Waterman subgraph similarity (SWSS) for lncRNAs. Smith
Waterman algorithm is a powerful tool to calculate similarity between biological
sequences, but Smith Waterman algorithm only takes the sequence information into account.
By considering sequence information and interactions information, we define Smith Waterman subgraph similarity (SWSS) between lncRNA Li and lncRNA Lj as,
SWSS Li; Lj
SWðPo1; Po2Þ
where SW(Po1,Po2) is the Smith Waterman score between protein Po1 and protein Po2. A(Li)
and A(Lj) are the set of proteins which interact with Li and Lj. n1 = |A(Li)| and n2 = |A(Lj)|.
Therefore, we obtain three lncRNA-lncRNA similarities: PseDNC similarity, IP similarity
and SWSS similarity.
Protein-protein similarities.
As introduced in Section “Protein features”, we have two
proteins features: PseAAC and IP. We also calculate two types of similarities by using the linear
neighborhood similarity measure.
Similarly, we can calculate the Smith Waterman Subgraph Similarity (SWSS) between two
proteins Pi and Pj,
SWSS Pi; Pj
SWðLo1; Lo2Þ
where SW(Po1,Po2) is the Smith Waterman score between lncRNA Lo1 and lncRNA Lo2. A(Pi)
and A(Pj) are the set of lncRNAs which interact with protein Pi and protein Pj. m1 = |A(Pi)|
and m2 = |A(Pj)|.
Therefore, we obtain three protein-protein similarities: PseAAC similarity, IP similarity
and SWSS similarity.
Feature projection ensemble learning method
Combining various features or fusing various features can usually lead to high-accuracy models . We have n features for lncRNAs (or proteins), denoted as n feature matrices
i¼1, and have m types of similarities for lncRNAs (or proteins), denoted as m similarity
matrices fWig
i¼1. The predicted lncRNA-protein interaction matrix is denoted as R. The

known lncRNA-protein interaction matrix is denoted as Y. The flowchart of the feature projection ensemble learning method SFPEL-LPI is shown in Fig 1.
Objective function.
First, lncRNA (or protein) feature matrices fXig

projected to the predicted lncRNA-protein interaction matrix R by using the projection matrices fGig
i¼1. We estimate the projection matrices fGig
i¼1 for features by minimizing the
squared error between their products and the predicted lncRNA-protein interaction matrix R.
So we have:

where k  k
F is the Frobenius norm, and the projection matrices fGig

nonnegative.
Then, we introduce the ‘1;2-norm regularization term of fGig

interaction matrix Y. We can have

Local structure of data can be maintained effectively through constructing a weighted
graph or a similarity graph on a scatter of data points. For example, Xu et al. introduced
the manifold regularization term to preserve the visual feature manifold structure. Nie et al.
 , Bai et al. , Cai et al. adopted graph Laplacian matrix to keep the graph’s local
structure. Moreover, the Studies revealed that the combination of multiple similarities helps to improve performances. Inspired by pioneer work, we define a novel ensemble
graph Laplacian regularization:
i trðRTðDi   WiÞRÞ
where Di is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are corresponding row sums of Wi,
and θ = [θ1,θ2,  ,θi,  ,θm] is a weight vector which is introduced to control the contribution
of different graph Laplacian regularizations, and tr() is the trace of a matrix. η>1 is the exponent of θ, which ensures that all graph Laplacian regularizations contribute effectively for the
maintaining of graph local structures.
By combining (4) and (5), we obtain the objective function of SFPEL-LPI:

the division in (9) is element-wise division. We separate the positive and negative parts of

Thus, we update R, Gi and θi based on (7), (8) and (9) alternatively until convergence.
Algorithms.
Following the method proposed in the Section “Objective function”,
SFPEL-LPI can predict unobserved interactions between known lncRNAs and proteins. First,
based on the lncRNA’s features, similarities and lncRNA-protein interactions, the prediction
matrix Rl could be obtained. Similarly, using protein’s features, similarities and proteinlncRNA interactions, the prediction matrix Rp could be calculated. Then, SFPEL-LPI integrates the predictions based on lncRNAs and proteins as M = (Rl+(Rp)T)/2. Therefore, the
unobserved interactions are scored in the corresponding entries of M. Algorithm 1 describes
how SFPEL-LPI predicts unobserved associations between known lncRNAs and known
In addition, SFPEL-LPI could also be applied to predict proteins (or lncRNAs) interacting
with new lncRNAs (or proteins). After using Algorithm 1 to train the model, the projection
matrix and the weighting parameters of lncRNA’s features as well as protein’s features: Glu,
Glv, θlu and θlv could be obtained. Then, we can use the features of new lncRNAs (or proteins)
and the trained parameters to predict their predictions. Algorithm 2 describes how SFPEL-LPI
finishes this task.

Evaluation metrics
We adopt five-fold cross validation to evaluate the performances of prediction models. The
proposed method SFPEL-LPI can predict unobserved interactions between known lncRNAs
and known proteins, and also can make predictions for new lncRNAs (or proteins). In predicting unobserved lncRNA-protein interactions, all known lncRNA-protein interactions are randomly split into five subsets with equal size. Each time, four subsets are combined as training
set and the remaining one subset is used as the testing set. In predicting proteins interacting
with new lncRNAs, all known lncRNAs are split into five subsets with equal size. The model is
constructed based on the lncRNAs in training set and their interactions with all proteins, and
then is used to predict proteins interacting with testing lncRNAs. Similarly, we evaluate the
performances of models in predicting lncRNAs interacting with new proteins. Hence, we
introduce notations for above mentioned cross validation settings. CVlp: known lncRNA-protein interactions are split into five folds in predicting unobserved interactions. CVl: known
lncRNAs are split into five folds in predicting interactions for new lncRNAs. CVp: known proteins are split into five folds in predicting interactions for new proteins.
The area under ROC curve (AUC) and the area under precision-recall curve (AUPR) are
popular metrics for evaluating prediction models. Since known lncRNA-protein interactions
are much less than non-interacting lncRNA-protein pairs, we adopt AUPR as the primary
metric, which punishes false positive more in the evaluation process . Moreover, we
adopt several binary classification metrics, i.e. recall (REC), accuracy (ACC), precision (PR)
and F1-measure (F1).
Parameter setting
SFPEL-LPI has three parameters: μ, λ and η. μ is a parameter for the error between projected
interactions and predicted lncRNA-protein interactions; λ controls the contribution of projection matrix; η describes strength of different similarity measures.

To test influence of parameters, we consider all combinations of parameters μ2{10−4,10−3,
10−2,10−1,100,101,102,103}, μ2{10−4,10−3,10−2,10−1,100,101,102,103} and η2{21,22,23,24,25,26,
27,28}. We build SFPEL-LPI models by using different parameters, and implement five-fold
cross validation CVlp to evaluate SFPEL-LPI models. SFPEL-LPI produces the best AUPR
score of 0.473 when μ = 10−3, λ = 10−4 and η = 22. Then, we fix the parameter η = 22, and evaluate the influence of μ and λ. As shown in Fig 2A, μ greatly influences the performance of
SFPEL-LPI, and a smaller value for μ is likely to produce better result. Further, we fix the
parameters μ = 10−3 and λ = 10−4 and test the influence of η. As illustrated in Fig 2B, the performances of SFPEL-LPI decrease as η increases, and then remain unchanged after a
threshold.
The parameter η is the index of similarity weights, and could control the relative contributions of different similarities. When fixing μ = 10−3 and λ = 10−4, we analyze the relation
between η and lncRNA similarity measures θlncRNA (or protein similarity measures θprotein). As
shown in Fig 3, similarities usually make different contributions to SFPEL-LPI models, and
interaction profile similarities usually make more contributions than other similarities. With
increase of η, different similarities are likely to make equal contributions.
Based on above discussion, we adopt μ = 10−3, λ = 10−4 and η= 22 for SFPEL-LPI in the following studies.
Performances of SFPEL-LPI
SFPEL-LPI can predict unobserved lncRNA-protein interactions between known lncRNAs
and known proteins, and also can make predictions for new lncRNAs (or proteins). For different tasks, we adopt different evaluation schemes to split instances and implement five-fold
cross validation under settings: CVlp, CVl and CVp.

CVp. According to previous studies , a prediction model that can accurately recover

the true interacting proteins (or lncRNAs) is usually desired and useful for the wet experimental validation. Thus, we calculate the proportion of correctly predicted true interactions at different top-ranked percentiles under CVl or CVp. A new matric “recall @ top-ranked k %” is
defined as the fraction of true interacting proteins (or lncRNAs) that are retrieved in the list of
top-ranked k% predictions for a lncRNA (or protein). In Fig 4A, SFPEL-LPI performs effectively in predicting proteins (or lncRNAs) interacting with new lncRNAs (or proteins). The
reason why the performances of predicting lncRNAs interacting with new proteins is not as
well as the performances of predicting proteins interacting with new lncRNAs is that the number of lncRNAs (990) in our dataset is much more than the number of proteins (27). Consequently, less information is used to train SFPEL-LPI models.
To further test capability of SFPEL-LPI for new proteins, we randomly select ten proteins to
conduct experiments. In each experiment, a protein is used as the testing protein, and the
model is constructed based on other proteins, all lncRNAs and their associations, and then
predict lncRNAs interacting with the testing protein. AUC scores and AUPR scores are calculated based on the results for each protein. As shown in Fig 4B, SFPEL-LPI produces the
AUPR values greater than 0.6 and the AUC values greater than 0.7 for most proteins, indicating great potential of predicting lncRNAs interacting with new proteins.
Comparison with state-of-the-art prediction methods
Several state-of-the-art computational methods have been proposed to predict lncRNA-protein interactions. Here, we adopt RWR , LPBNI , KATZLGO , LPI-ETSLP and
LPLNP for comparison. RWR implemented random walk with restart to predict lncRNAprotein interactions. LPBNI constructed a lncRNA-protein bipartite network based on known
lncRNA-protein interactions, and then predicted lncRNA-protein interactions by using the

resource allocation algorithm. KATZLGO constructed a heterogeneous network based on
lncRNA-lncRNA similarity, lncRNA-protein interactions and protein-protein similarity, and
then adopted KATZ measure to calculate distances between lncRNAs and proteins in the network. LPI-ETSLP calculated lncRNA-lncRNA similarity and protein-protein similarity based
on pairwise sequence Smith-Waterman scores, and then built semi-supervised link prediction
classifier based on these similarities. LPNLP calculated three lncRNA-lncRNA similarities and
two protein-protein similarities by using linear neighborhood similarity measure, and implemented label propagation to develop the integrated models.
First, we respectively build different prediction models based on the benchmark dataset.
The benchmark methods were designed to predict unobserved interaction between know
lncRNAs and know proteins. Therefore, we implement these methods and mainly evaluate
their performances in predicting unobserved interactions under CVlp. As shown in Table 2,
the AUPR values of RWR, LPBNI, KATZLGO, LPI-ETSLP, LPLNP and SFPEL-LPI are 0.236,
0.330, 0.286, 0.322, 0.459, 0.473, and AUC values are 0.850, 0.856, 0.760, 0.889, 0.910 and
0.920, respectively. SFPEL-LPI outperforms these five methods, and makes 100.4%, 43.3%,
65.4%, 46.9%, 3.1% improvements in terms of AUPR scores and 8.2%, 7.5%, 21.1%, 3.5%, 1.1%
improvements in terms of AUC scores when compared with five benchmark methods. Though
SFPEL-LPI produces slightly better performances than LPLNP in terms of AUPR and AUC,
LPLNP utilizes more information than SFPEL-LPI for modeling. To be more specific, LPLNP
uses three lncRNA features (“interaction profile”, “expression profile”, “sequence composition”) and two protein features (“interaction profile”, “CTD”), while SFPEL-LPI only used
lncRNA sequences, protein lncRNAs and known lncRNA-protein interactions.
We conduct 20 runs of five-fold cross validation to evaluate methods, and take the paired ttest to analyze difference between SFPEL-LPI and benchmark methods. Table 3 demonstrates

that SFPEL-LPI produces significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods in terms of
AUC and AUPR.
The computational complexity is important for a computational method. To test the efficiency of SFPEL-LPI, we repeat 5-fold cross validation 20 times and compare running time of
different methods on a PC with an Intel i7 7700k CPU and 16GB RAM. SFPEL-LPI costs the
reasonable running time (29.42s) when compared with RWR (25.83s), LPBNI (4.01s),
KATZLGO (4.36s), LPI-ETSLP (4.56s) and LPLNP (1337.64s).
Further, we randomly perturb all known lncRNA-protein interactions to test the robustness
of prediction methods. To be more specific, we randomly remove 5% of known lncRNA-protein interactions and add the same number of inexistent interactions, and then compile the
perturbed dataset. We build different prediction models based on the perturbed dataset and
evaluate their performances. Clearly, data perturbation brings noise, and decreases the performances of prediction models. As displayed in Fig 5, AUC scores of RWR, LPBNI, KATZLGO,
LPI-ETSLP, LPLNP, SFPEL-LPI are 0.812, 0.820, 0.735, 0.865, 0.874 and 0.889; AUPR scores
are 0.192, 0.268, 0.225, 0.271, 0.343 and 0.351. Although prediction models produce lower performances than that in Table 2, SFPEL-LPI still produces satisfying results, and outperforms
RWR, LPBNI, KATZLGO, LPI-ETSLP and LPLNP.

Independent experiments
Here, we conduct independent experiments to evaluate the practical ability of SFPEL-LPI. As
described in Section “Dataset”, NPInter v2.0 dataset was compiled from the V2.0 edition of NPInter database. NPInter database has been updated to V3.0 edition, and contains newly discovered
lncRNA-protein interactions. Therefore, we train the prediction model based on the NPInter v2.0
dataset and predict new lncRNA-protein interactions, and then check up on predictions in the
NPInter database. Fig 6 shows the number of confirmed interactions in top 20 predictions of all
Fig 6. The number of confirmed lncRNA-protein interactions in top 20 predictions of different methods.

methods. Clearly, SFPEL-LPI finds out more interactions than benchmark methods. In addition,
we observe that most of novel interactions identified by SFPEL-LPI have low ranks in the predictions of other benchmark methods, indicating that SFPEL-LPI can find out interactions ignored
by these methods. Top predictions and their ranks are provided in S1 Table.
Web server
We develop a web server based on SFPEL-LPI to facilitate the lncRNA-protein interaction
prediction, available at Users can input lncRNA sequences (or protein sequences) or upload a text file with FASTA-formatted lncRNA sequences
(or protein sequences) for prediction, and freely download the results and visualize the predicted lncRNA-protein interactions. Moreover, gene ontology (GO) terms of proteins are
annotated for indicating lncRNAs’ functions.
Fig 7 displays the top 10 predictions for the lncRNA “NONHSAT041930”. “NON-
HSAT041930” named OIP5-AS1 (OIP5 antisense RNA 1), is a mammalian lncRNA that is
abundant in the cytoplasm . OIP5-AS1 has gained wide attention. In 2011, it was first

identified to be involved in brain and eye development . In 2016, Kim et al. found that
it can prevent HuR binding to target mRNAs and thus suppress the HuR-elicited proliferative
phenotypes. Moreover, the lncRNA was found to interact with GAK mRNA, promoting GAK
mRNA decay and hence reducing GAK protein levels and lowering cell proliferation .
Among top 10 predicted proteins interacting with OIP5-AS1, two proteins have already been
known to have interactions with OIP5-AS1, which are included in the NPInter dataset. In
addition, we find evidence from literature to support other six predicted proteins. For example,
IGF2BP1, IGF2BP2, IGF2BP3, EWSR1 and TIA1 have already been examined to interact with
OIP5-AS1 according to lncRNA-protein interacting data report . Protein Argonaute 2
(AGO2) is required for proper nuclear migration, pole cell formation, and cellularization during the early stages of embryonic development. Several studies showed that OIP5-AS1
is associated with AGO2. Moreover, annotated GO terms of predicted proteins indicate the
function of the lncRNA OIP5-AS1: mRNA binding (GO: 0005845, GO: 0035925, GO:
0036002, GO: 0048027, GO: 0098808) and cell proliferation (GO:0022013). More details are
provided in S2 Table. These encouraging instances demonstrate that the proposed method can
successfully predict novel lncRNA-protein interactions.
Moreover, the server can predict interacting lncRNAs for proteins. For example, top 20
interacting lncRNAs of the protein “9606.ENSP00000240185” are shown in the Fig 8, and
details are provided in S3 Table.

from integrating sequence-derived features and similarities with a feature projection ensemble
learning frame. Specifically, SFPEL-LPI only utilizes lncRNA sequences, protein sequences
and known interactions to extract features, and calculates lncRNA-lncRNA similarities and
protein-protein similarities. Since sequences are usually available for lncRNAs or proteins,
SFPEL-LPI can make predictions for almost all lncRNA-protein pairs. Moreover, diverse
information leads to the good performances of SFPEL-LPI.
To evaluate the performance of SFPEL-LPI, an extensive set of experiments were performed
on the benchmark dataset under three CV setting: CVlp, CVl and CVp, compared with state-ofthe-art lncRNA-protein interaction prediction methods. The promising results validate efficacy of the proposed algorithm for predicting lncRNA-protein interactions, especially for the
new lncRNAs or new proteins, which do not have known interactions. SFPEL-LPI outperforms five methods: RWR, LPBNI, KATZLGO, LPI-ETSLP, LPLNP, and makes 100.4%,
43.3%, 65.4%, 46.9%, 3.1% improvements in terms of AUPR scores. Further, we also analyze
the running time of SFPEL-LPI and benchmark methods, and randomly perturb all known
lncRNA-protein interactions to test the robustness of prediction methods. A web server is constructed to predict interacting proteins/lncRNAs for given lncRNAs/proteins. We adopt the
lncRNA “NONHSAT041930” as an example to predict interacting proteins, and can find evidences to confirm novel lncRNA-protein interactions.
However, SFPEL-LPI still has several limitations. It has three parameters, and parameter
tuning is time-consuming. In addition, known lncRNA-protein interactions are limited, and
performances of SFPEL-LPI will be improved if more interactions are known.
