Computer assisted learning in undergraduate medical
Trisha Greenhalgh
It is becoming “a truth universally acknowledged” that
the education of undergraduate medical students will be
learning. Access to the wide range of online options
illustrated in the figure must surely make learning more
exciting, effective, and likely to be retained. This assumption is potentially but by no means inevitably correct.
Deans of medical faculties often receive requests
development
learning projects. Decisions to introduce these projects
into the undergraduate curriculum are generally justified by one or more of the arguments listed in box 1.
Developing applications
Computer assisted learning applications generally
require the student to follow the content without
immediate or direct supervision from the tutor. But the
computer can be a temperamental and unforgiving
beast, and computer assisted learning applications
must therefore embody the quality features described
in box 2. For all these reasons, computer assisted learning materials are initially much more labour intensive
and time consuming to prepare than most face to face
courses, and they often require input from fairly senior
members of staff. Once the basic format is agreed and
the initial materials have been written, however,
materials can be maintained and updated relatively
easily and by more junior members. Off the shelf templates that allow someone with no specific training to
produce materials of professional quality are increasingly available. Introducing computer assisted learning
technologies into a traditional course will generally
occur in stages, as described in box 3. Adapting
pre-existing materials designed as handouts or revision
notes can sometimes save considerable time.
Fulfilling its potential
Educationists are excited about the potential of so
called third generation distance education technologies
environment
5 in which the learner actively builds rather
than passively consumes knowledge. This requires a
transformed view of the nature of knowledge itself as
dynamic, open ended, multidimensional, and public
rather than static, finite, linear, and private.
Computer technologies can support a wide range
of learning activities which engage students in a
continuous collaborative process of building and
understanding.
theoretical
appeal and broadly positive results from a handful of
randomised trials conducted by enthusiasts (table), the
real advantages of computer assisted learning in medical curricula outside the research setting have yet to be
shown consistently.
Published studies
Few articles on computer assisted learning in medical
education have been published. A search of Medline
and ERIC databases using the Mesh term “medical
education” and free text terms “computer based” and
“computer assisted” turned up around 200 potentially
relevant studies, of which only 12 were prospective
Box 1: Why fund computer assisted learning?
Computer assisted learning is inevitable—Individual lecturers and departments
are already beginning to introduce a wide range of computer based
applications, sometimes in a haphazard way. Planned and coordinated
development is better than indiscriminate expansion
It is convenient and flexible—Courses supported by computer assisted learning
applications may require fewer face to face lectures and seminars and place
fewer geographical and temporal constraints on staff and students. Students
at peripheral hospitals or primary care centres may benefit in particular
Unique presentational benefits—Computer presentation is particularly suited
to subjects that are visually intensive, detail oriented, and difficult to
conceptualise, such as complex biochemical processes or microscopic
1 Furthermore, “virtual” cases may reduce the need to use animal or
human tissue in learning
Personalised learning—Each learner can progress at his or her preferred
pace. They can repeat, interrupt, and resume at will, which may have
particular advantages for weaker students
Economies of scale—Once an application has been set up, the incremental
cost of offering it to additional students is relatively small
Competitive advantage—Potential applicants may use the quality of
information technology to discriminate between medical schools. A
“leading edge” virtual campus is likely to attract good students
Achieves the ultimate goal of higher education—The goal is to link people into
learning communities. Computer applications, especially the internet and
world wide web, are an extremely efficient way of doing this
Expands pedagogical horizons—The most controversial argument for using
computer assisted learning in higher education is the alleged ability of the
virtual campus to alter fundamentally the relation between people and
Summary points
Reduced funding, rising student numbers,
geographical dispersal, and increased competition
in a complex global market have put medical
schools under pressure to embrace computer
assisted learning
New technologies may have important
educational advantages, but without support and
training for staff and students they could prove an
expensive disaster
Expansion of computer assisted learning requires
cultural change as well as careful strategic
planning, resource sharing, staff incentives, active
promotion of multidisciplinary working, and
effective quality control

randomised studies with objective, predefined outcome criteria (table). These studies represent a range of
different settings, interventions, and outcomes and are
therefore not directly comparable. Most studies have
methodological problems, including lack of statistical
power, potential contamination between intervention
and control groups, and attrition of the sample.
As the table shows, the randomised controlled trials
suggested that the efficacy (the “can it work?” question
described by Haynes
17) of high quality programmes in
medical education is reasonably well established, a
finding that is in keeping with meta-analyses of
computer assisted learning in non-medical education.
18 However, the effectiveness and cost effectiveness
of these initiatives remain in doubt.
In the mid-1990s, at least two UK medical schools
supplied all first year students with laptop computers
and enhanced access to a range of networked multimedia applications. One project was never formally
evaluated, but anecdotal reports suggested that many
students found the computers expensive, impractical,
and difficult to integrate with the mainstream curriculum (P Booton, personal communication). Results of the
other project were published. The authors bravely
admitted that some students made no use of their computers at all, technical glitches and incompatibility problems were common, staff were ill prepared for the
change in learning medium, and “there was no
academic organisational structure to shape a coherent
response to the rapid increase in computer use.”
Lack of engagement
Failure of students to engage with newly introduced
technology
non-medical education. Perceived barriers include
inadequate planning, poor integration with other
forms of learning, and cultural resistance from staff.
One ethnographic study in which students were closely
observed while taking part in online courses showed
that considerable frustration and time wasting arose
from poor course design, technical glitches, “dead”
hypertext links, poorly coordinated real time seminars,
and ambiguous instructions.
20 The only study of
computer assisted learning in medical education that
used comparable, in depth, qualitative methods found
few such problems, but it was restricted to students’ use
of computers in a supervised classroom setting.
Transferability and evaluation
Three important conclusions can be drawn from the
reports. Firstly, innovators who have developed apparently successful products should be guarded about
claiming that their systems are transferable, even when
the efficacy of these systems has been shown in the
evaluation
educational technologies should include observation
of unsupervised students attempting to gain access
from remote sites and follow online links and instruc-
Box 3: Stages in integrating web technology
into a traditional degree course (adapted from
Devitt and Palmer
Level 1—Course has a public access web page directed
at potential students
Level 2—Course materials include links to public access
Level 3—Students generate web based resources
(glossaries, topic summaries, etc) and share them on
an internal website
Level 4—Key course resources (lecture notes, slides, etc)
are available on an internal website
Level 5—Students prepare materials based on course
content (for example, clinical case histories) for other
learners and publish them on the internet
Level 6—Participation in web based learning activities is
a course requirement (for example, a course based
bulletin board)
Level 7—Participation in web based learning activities
extending beyond the class is a course requirement
(for example, membership of an academic list server)
Level 8—Web serves as an alternative delivery
mechanism for resident students (range of interactive
materials available for asynchronous access to students
on campus, who may choose to work with these rather
than attend some face to face classes)
Level 9—Entire course is available on the web for
students to access anywhere (includes full electronic
syllabus, teleconferencing, facilities for sending and
receiving attachments, and collaborative coursework)
Level 10—Fully web based course is part of larger
programmatic web initiative (for example, students
may collect transferable credits from this course
towards a trans-university degree)
Box 2: Quality features of applications
Open learning (self study) materials—Applications must be prepared in
advance, cover explicit course aims and learning objectives, and include a
high degree of “signposting,” explanatory text, and trouble shooting
information
Website design—Websites should have a logical structure and sequence, utilise
features such as hypertext and graphics, and include links to public access,
web based materials such as electronic journals where appropriate
Technical design—Applications must be user friendly and operate effectively
within the hardware and software constraints of the end user
University culture—Applications must present an academic ethos in the
untidy, commercial, and laissez-faire culture of web based publishing and
protect the student from the distractions of the internet
Copyright protection—Applications should reflect an agreed university policy
on intellectual property rights

tions. Thirdly, neither course materials nor teaching
skills are directly transferable from the traditional
lecture theatre to the virtual campus. We should recognise, and take systematic steps to guard against, the
danger of allowing inadequately trained tutors and lecturers to “go virtual.”
Learning culture
The differences in learning culture between computer
based and traditional learning should not be underestimated, especially for the novice. As Reingold
argues, “Fear is an important element in every novice

new software: fear of destroying data, fear of hurting
the machine, fear of seeming stupid in comparison to
others, or even to the machine itself.”
One author has distinguished between students
who “lose themselves” and those who “find themselves”
in the virtual environment of email discussions,
another found that whereas some students perceived
their virtual seminar group as part of a warm, friendly,
and supportive online community, others perceived
themselves facing a whole sea of strangers, perhaps
reflecting different stages in the development of online
learning skills (box 4) or different learning styles.
Issues of costs and training
The cost of hardware and software, and telephone line
charges, often prove a more important barrier to accessing web based materials than the course organisers
initially assume. The amount of training needed to
become comfortable with specialised software packages
is often underestimated; students on a course that relies
heavily on computer work may spend most of their first
term getting to grips with the technology. Few students
learn all the essential technical skills at the outset of the
course. Rather, they tend to use “just in time learning”—
that is, most of them make no attempt to get to grips
with a feature of the software until they actually need to
use that feature. This suggests that too much initial
training may not be popular or effective
Recommendations for introducing
computer assisted learning
Invest in staff development
Developing computer assisted learning applications is
a lengthy and skilled process. Innovators within
traditional courses have embraced the concept and
have often produced creative and high quality material
supplement
individuals are in a minority; most academics will not
become developers or supporters of computer assisted
learning unless considerable time and resources are
dedicated to supporting this activity.
25 Staff who are
sent on “generic” workshops designed to improve their
use of computer assisted learning technologies may
complain afterwards that they still do not know where
to start and feel that the time was not well spent.
all these reasons, staff training should be tightly
targeted and be offered on a project by project basis.
Provide a central resource base
Avoid reinventing the wheel. Templates, models, and
images developed for one course may also serve
another course within the same institution (and even
beyond it). Mechanisms to allow exchange of skills,
resources, and ideas between institutions must be put
in place early, as exemplified by the University of Aberdeen Medical School’s structured approach to the
development
addition, medical schools must identify and become
part of wider networks that are already sharing and
working collaboratively on materials, such as the UK
Assisting Collaborative Education Project.
Aim to use different methods
Academics generally construct courses in a somewhat
haphazard way from prepared lectures, handouts,
photocopies of book chapters, reading lists, journal
articles, laboratory notes, case studies, and so on.
Hence, the vision of a degree course that is completely
virtual—high tech, fully integrated, stand alone, based
entirely on computer applications, and difficult to
upgrade—is unlikely to become the model for the
typical course of the future. Rather, computer assisted
learning products are most likely to be used by
academics if they are easily customised, capable of
integrated
traditional teaching material, and discarded as soon as
their useful life is past.
Staff incentives
Intensive and continuing central support for departmental initiatives should be linked to appropriate
incentives and rewards for individual staff who become
active members of the virtual campus. These should be
both internal (for example, included in criteria for promotion) and external (for example, accreditation via
Association for Learning Technologies).

Multidisciplinary working
The development of computer based teaching and
learning materials requires expertise in content, in
pedagogy, and in technical aspects of design and delivery. Staff with most to offer in the way of technical
design may overlook important educational principles,
and those who focus on content may make incorrect
assumptions about the ability of the technology to
deliver their imaginative ideas. A multidisciplinary,
team based approach is likely to be the most successful
model for working.
Address issues of organisational culture
Introducing interactive learning technology is a contemporary
difficulties
embedding new ideas and new ways of working into
institutions that are resistant to change. Lessons can be
drawn from strategic change theory; essential steps
energising
commitment, developing political support, managing
the transition, and sustaining momentum. Resistance to
change is most likely to come from the underlying
culture of the organisation—that is, values, ways of thinking, management styles, and pedagogical paradigms.
Initiatives to develop computer based materials
usually begin as distinct projects with management
and development processes separate from, and parallel
to, the existing structures and processes of the university. This inevitably limits the impact of the initiative in
terms of its benefits to the whole organisation,
increases costs through duplication, and imposes limits
to its expansion and continuation. Ad hoc innovations
in computer assisted learning, whether conceived of as
pilot or pump priming projects, frequently fade away
when the individuals associated with them move on to
other activities.
Developing a university from a position in which it
supports small, discrete, department based initiatives to
one in which the virtual campus is embedded in established mainstream activities is complex. Stress lines may
appear in a number of areas, notably student administration, student support, quality assurance, staff development policies and priorities, infrastructure development,
financial management, and resource priorities.
The future
Many medical schools are discovering the prohibitive
cost of producing high quality computer assisted
learning materials. In the spirit of Dr Blunkett’s
collaborative e-university, a new form of academic
commerce in off the shelf, web based course materials
is beginning to emerge.
31 Agreements between universities (and countries) on sharing units of education
may eventually lead to the awarding of a degree that
cannot be identified with a single institution.
25 Funding
of a medical degree may even begin to occur on a
module by module basis and, arguably, is less likely to
come from a single central source.
32 The medical
school of the future may be one that can successfully
offer (in collaboration with other educational providers) a flexible menu of both face to face and self study
modules from which individual students can select to
meet their own unique requirements. Any other
option, including staying as we are, may ultimately
prove unaffordable.
