Background: As more and more researchers are turning to big data for new opportunities of biomedical discoveries, machine
learning models, as the backbone of big data analysis, are mentioned more often in biomedical journals. However, owing to the
inherent complexity of machine learning methods, they are prone to misuse. Because of the flexibility in specifying machine
learning models, the results are often insufficiently reported in research articles, hindering reliable assessment of model validity
and consistent interpretation of model outputs.
Objective: To attain a set of guidelines on the use of machine learning predictive models within clinical settings to make sure
the models are correctly applied and sufficiently reported so that true discoveries can be distinguished from random coincidence.
Methods: A multidisciplinary panel of machine learning experts, clinicians, and traditional statisticians were interviewed, using
an iterative process in accordance with the Delphi method.
Results: The process produced a set of guidelines that consists of (1) a list of reporting items to be included in a research article
and (2) a set of practical sequential steps for developing predictive models.
Conclusions: A set of guidelines was generated to enable correct application of machine learning models and consistent reporting
of model specifications and results in biomedical research. We believe that such guidelines will accelerate the adoption of big
data analysis, particularly with machine learning methods, in the biomedical research community.

Introduction
Big data is changing every industry. Medicine is no exception.
With rapidly growing volume and diversity of data in health
care and biomedical research, traditional statistical methods
often are inadequate. By looking into other industries where
modern machine learning techniques play central roles in dealing
with big data, many health and biomedical researchers have
started applying machine learning to extract valuable insights
from ever-growing biomedical databases, in particular with
predictive models . The flexibility and prowess of machine
learning models also enable us to leverage novel but extremely
valuable sources of information, such as wearable device data
and electronic health record data .
Despite its popularity, it is difficult to find a universally
agreed-upon definition for machine learning. Arguably, many
machine learning methods can be traced back as far as 30 years
ago . However, machine learning started making a broad
impact only in the last 10 years. The reviews by Jordan and
Mitchell and Ghahramani provide accessible overviews
for machine learning. In this paper, we focus on machine
learning predictive methods and models. These include random
forest, support vector machines, and other methods listed in
Multimedia Appendix 1. They all share an important difference
from the traditional statistical methods such as logistic regression
or analysis of variance—the ability to make accurate predictions
on unseen data. To optimize the prediction accuracy, often the
methods do not attempt to produce interpretable models. This
also allows them to handle a large number of variables common
in most big data problems.
Accompanying the flexibility of emerging machine learning
techniques, however, is uncertainty and inconsistency in the
use of such techniques. Machine learning, owing to its intrinsic
mathematical and algorithmic complexity, is often considered
a “black magic” that requires a delicate balance of a large
number of conflicting factors. This, together with inadequate
reporting of data sources and modeling process, makes research
results reported in many biomedical papers difficult to interpret.
It is not rare to see potentially spurious conclusions drawn from
methodologically inadequate studies , which in turn
compromises the credibility of other valid studies and
discourages many researchers who could benefit from adopting
machine learning techniques.
Most pitfalls of applying machine learning techniques in
biomedical research originate from a small number of common
issues, including data leakage and overfitting ,
which can be avoided by adopting a set of best practice
standards. Recognizing the urgent need for such a standard, we
created a minimum list of reporting items and a set of guidelines
for optimal use of predictive models in biomedical research.
Panel of Experts
In 2015, a multidisciplinary panel was assembled to cover
expertise in machine learning, traditional statistics, and
biomedical applications of these methods. The candidate list
was generated in two stages. The panel grew from a number of
active machine learning researchers attending international
conferences including the Asian Conference on Machine
Learning, the Pacific Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery
and Data Mining, and the International Conference on Pattern
Recognition. The responders were then asked to nominate
additional researchers who apply machine learning in biomedical
research. Effort was exercised to include researchers from
different continents. Researchers from the list were approached
through emails for joining the panel and/or recommending
colleagues to be included. Two declined the invitation.
The final panel included 11 researchers from 3 institutions on
3 different continents. Each panelist had experience and
expertise in machine learning projects in biomedical applications
and has learned from common pitfalls. The areas of research
expertise included machine learning, data mining, computational
intelligence, signal processing, information management,
bioinformatics, and psychiatry. On average, each panel member
had 8.5 years’ experience in either developing or applying
machine learning methods. The diversity of the panel was
reflected by the members’ affiliation with 3 different institutions
across 3 continents.
Development of Guidelines
Using an iterative process, the panel produced a set of guidelines
that consists of (1) a list of reporting items to be included in a
research article and (2) a set of practical sequential steps for
developing predictive models. The Delphi method was used to
generate the list of reporting items.
The panelists were interviewed with multiple iterations of
emails. Email 1 asked panelists to list topics to be covered in
the guidelines. An aggregated topic list was generated. Email
2 asked each panelist to review the scope of the list and state
his or her recommendation for each topic in the aggregated list.
Later iterations of email interviews were organized to evolve
the list until all experts agreed on the list. Because of the logistic
complexity of coordinating the large panel, we took a
grow-shrink approach. In the growing phase, all suggested items
were included, even an item suggested by only 1 panelist. In
the shrinking phase, any item opposed by a panelist was
excluded. As it turned out, most items were initially suggested
by a panelist but seconded by other panelists, suggesting the
importance of the group effort for covering most important
The practical steps were developed by machine learning experts
in their respective areas and finally approved by the panel.
During the process, the panelists consulted extensively the broad
literature on machine learning and predictive model in particular
A total of 4 iterations of emails resulted in the final form of the
guidelines. Email 1 generated diverse responses in terms of
topics. However the final scope was generally agreed upon. For
email 2, most panelists commented on only a subset of topics
(mostly the ones suggested by themselves). No recommendations

generated significant disagreement except for minor wording
decisions and quantifying conditions.
The final results included a list of reporting items (Tables
1-5,Textboxes 1-4, and Figure 1) and a template flowchart for
reporting data used for training and testing predictive models,
including both internal validation and external validation (Figure
Recognizing the broad meaning of the term “machine learning,”
we distinguish essential items from desirable items (using
appropriate footnotes in the tables). The essential items should
be included in any report, unless there is a strong reason
indicating otherwise; the desirable items should be reported
whenever applicable.

aDesirable but not mandatory items.
Textbox 1. Data leakage problem.
Leakage refers to the unintended use of known information as unknown. There are two kinds of leakage: outcome leakage and validation leakage. In
outcome leakage, independent variables incorporate elements that can be used to easily infer outcomes. For example, a risk factor that spans into the
future may be used to predict the future itself. In the validation leakage, ground truth from the training set may propagate to the validation set. For
example, when the same patient is used in both training and validation, the future outcome in the training may overlap with the future outcome in the
validation. In both leakage cases, the performance obtained is overoptimistic.
Textbox 2. Calibration.
Calibration of a prediction model refers to the agreement between the predictions made by the model and the observed outcomes. As an example, if
the prediction model predicts 70% risk of mortality in the next 1 year for a patient with lung cancer, then the model is well calibrated if in our dataset
approximately 70% of patients with lung cancer die within the next 1 year.
Often, the regularized prediction may create bias in a model. Therefore, it is advisable to check for the calibration. In the case of regression models,
the calibration can be easily assessed graphically by marking prediction scores on the x-axis and the true outcomes on the y-axis. In the case of binary
classification, the y-axis has only 0 and 1 values; however, smoothing techniques such as LOESS algorithm may be used to estimate the observed
probabilities for the outcomes. In a more systematic way, one can perform the Hosmer-Lemeshow test to measure the goodness of fit of the model.
The test assesses whether the observed event rates match the predicted event rates in subgroups of the model population.

Textbox 3. Perfect separation problem.
When a categorical predictor variable can take an uncommon value, there may be only a small number of observations having that value. In a
classification problem, these few observations by chance may have the same response value. Such “perfect” predictors may cause overfitting, especially
when tree-based models are used. Therefore, special treatment is required.
One conservative approach is to remove all dummy variables corresponding to rare categories. We recommend a cutoff of 10 observations.
For modeling methods with feature selection built in, an alternative approach is to first fit a model with all independent variables. If the resulting
model is only marginally influenced by the rare categories, then the model can be kept. Otherwise, the rare categories showing high “importance”
score are removed and the model refitted.
Textbox 4. K-fold cross-validation.
K-fold validation refers to the practice of splitting the derivation data into K equal parts. The model is then trained on K−1 parts and validated on the
remaining part. The process is repeated K times. The average results for K-folds are then reported. For small classes and rare categorical factors,
stratified K-fold splitting should be used to ensure the equal presence of these classes and factors in each fold.
Discussion
We have generated a set of guidelines that will enable correct
application of machine learning models and consistent reporting
of model specifications and results in biomedical research.
Because of the broad range of machine learning methods that
can be used in biomedical applications, we involved a large
number of stakeholders, as either developers of machine learning
methods or users of these methods in biomedicine research.
The guidelines here cover most popular machine learning
methods appearing in biomedical studies. We believe that such
guidelines will accelerate the adoption of big data analysis,
particularly with machine learning methods, in the biomedical
research community.
Although the proposed guidelines result from a voluntary effort
without dedicated funding support, we still managed to assemble
a panel of researchers from multiple disciplines, multiple
institutions, and multiple continents. We hope the guidelines
can result in more people contributing their knowledge and
experience in the discussion.
As machine learning is a rapidly developing research area, the
guidelines are not expected to cover every aspect of the
modeling process. The guidelines are expected to evolve as
research in biomedicine and machine learning progresses.
