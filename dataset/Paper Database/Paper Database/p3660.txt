To my parents, my wife Yue and children Shelley and Kate
The rapid growth of the Web in the last decade makes it the largest publicly accessible data source in the world. Web mining aims to discover useful information or knowledge from Web hyperlinks, page contents, and usage logs. Based on the primary kinds of data used in the mining process,
Web mining tasks can be categorized into three main types: Web structure
mining, Web content mining and Web usage mining. Web structure mining discovers knowledge from hyperlinks, which represent the structure of
the Web. Web content mining extracts useful information/knowledge from
Web page contents. Web usage mining mines user access patterns from
usage logs, which record clicks made by every user.
The goal of this book is to present these tasks, and their core mining algorithms. The book is intended to be a text with a comprehensive coverage, and yet, for each topic, sufficient details are given so that readers can
gain a reasonably complete knowledge of its algorithms or techniques
without referring to any external materials. Four of the chapters, structured
data extraction, information integration, opinion mining, and Web usage
mining, make this book unique. These topics are not covered by existing
books, but yet they are essential to Web data mining. Traditional Web
mining topics such as search, crawling and resource discovery, and link
analysis are also covered in detail in this book.
Although the book is entitled Web Data Mining, it also includes the
main topics of data mining and information retrieval since Web mining
uses their algorithms and techniques extensively. The data mining part
mainly consists of chapters on association rules and sequential patterns,
supervised learning (or classification), and unsupervised learning (or clustering), which are the three most important data mining tasks. The advanced topic of partially (semi-) supervised learning is included as well.
For information retrieval, its core topics that are crucial to Web mining are
described. This book is thus naturally divided into two parts. The first part,
which consists of Chaps. 2–5, covers data mining foundations. The second
part, which contains Chaps. 6–12, covers Web specific mining.
Two main principles have guided the writing of this book. First, the basic content of the book should be accessible to undergraduate students, and
yet there are sufficient in-depth materials for graduate students who plan to
pursue Ph.D. degrees in Web data mining or related areas. Few assumptions are made in the book regarding the prerequisite knowledge of readers. One with a basic understanding of algorithms and probability concepts
should have no problem with this book. Second, the book should examine
the Web mining technology from a practical point of view. This is important because most Web mining tasks have immediate real-world applications. In the past few years, I was fortunate to have worked directly or indirectly with many researchers and engineers in several search engine and
e-commerce companies, and also traditional companies that are interested
in exploiting the information on the Web in their businesses. During the
process, I gained practical experiences and first-hand knowledge of realworld problems. I try to pass those non-confidential pieces of information
and knowledge along in the book. The book, thus, should have a good balance of theory and practice. I hope that it will not only be a learning text
for students, but also a valuable source of information/knowledge and even
ideas for Web mining researchers and practitioners.
Acknowledgements
Many researchers have assisted me technically in writing this book. Without their help, this book might never have become reality. My deepest
thanks goes to Filippo Menczer and Bamshad Mobasher, who were so kind
to have helped write two essential chapters of the book. They are both experts in their respective fields. Filippo wrote the chapter on Web crawling
and Bamshad wrote the chapter on Web usage mining. I am also very
grateful to Wee Sun Lee, who helped a great deal in the writing of Chap. 5
on partially supervised learning.
Jian Pei helped with the writing of the PrefixSpan algorithm in Chap. 2,
and checked the MS-PS algorithm. Eduard Dragut assisted with the writing
of the last section of Chap. 10 and also read the chapter many times.
Yuanlin Zhang gave many great suggestions on Chap. 9. I am indebted to
all of them.
Many other researchers also assisted in various ways. Yang Dai and
Rudy Setiono helped with Support Vector Machines (SVM). Chris Ding
helped with link analysis. Clement Yu and ChengXiang Zhai read Chap. 6,
and Amy Langville read Chap. 7. Kevin C.-C. Chang, Ji-Rong Wen and
Clement Yu helped with many aspects of Chap 10. Justin Zobel helped
clarify some issues related to index compression, and Ion Muslea helped
clarify some issues on wrapper induction. Divy Agrawal, Yunbo Cao,
Edward Fox, Hang Li, Xiaoli Li, Zhaohui Tan, Dell Zhang and Zijian
Zheng helped check various chapters or sections. I am very grateful.
VIII Preface
Discussions with many researchers helped shape the book as well: Amir
Ashkenazi, Imran Aziz, Roberto Bayardo, Wendell Baker, Ling Bao,
Jeffrey Benkler, AnHai Doan, Byron Dom, Michael Gamon, Robert
Grossman, Jiawei Han, Wynne Hsu, Ronny Kohavi, David D. Lewis, Ian
McAllister, Wei-Ying Ma, Marco Maggini, Llew Mason, Kamel Nigan,
Julian Qian, Yan Qu, Thomas M. Tirpak, Andrew Tomkins, Alexander
Tuzhilin, Weimin Xiao, Gu Xu, Philip S. Yu, and Mohammed Zaki.
My former and current students, Gao Cong, Minqing Hu, Nitin Jindal,
Xin Li, Yiming Ma, Yanhong Zhai and Kaidi Zhao checked many algorithms and made numerous corrections. Some chapters of the book have
been used in my graduate classes at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I
thank the students in these classes for implementing several algorithms.
Their questions helped me improve and, in some cases, correct the algorithms. It is not possible to list all their names. Here, I would particularly
like to thank John Castano, Xiaowen Ding, Murthy Ganapathibhotla, Cynthia Kersey, Hari Prasad Divyakotti, Ravikanth Turlapati, Srikanth Tadikonda, Makio Tamura, Haisheng Wang, and Chad Williams for pointing out
errors in texts, examples or algorithms. Michael Bombyk from DePaul
University also found several typing errors.
It was a pleasure working with the helpful staff at Springer. I thank my
editor Ralf Gerstner who asked me in early 2005 whether I was interested
in writing a book on Web mining. It has been a wonderful experience
working with him since. I also thank my copyeditor Mike Nugent for
helping me improve the presentation, and my production editor Michael
Reinfarth for guiding me through the final production process. Two
anonymous reviewers also gave me many insightful comments.
The Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at
Chicago provided computing resources and a supportive environment for
this project.
Finally, I thank my parents, brother and sister for their constant supports
and encouragements. My greatest gratitude goes to my own family: Yue,
Shelley and Kate. They have helped me in so many ways. Despite their
young ages, Shelley and Kate actually read many parts of the book and
caught numerous typing errors. My wife has taken care of almost everything at home and put up with me and the long hours that I have spent on
this book. I dedicate this book to them.
