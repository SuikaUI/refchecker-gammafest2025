In 2009-2010, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) operated together with international partners Virgo and GEO600 as
a network to search for gravitational waves of astrophysical origin. The sensitivity of these detectors was limited by a combination of noise sources inherent to
the instrumental design and its environment, often localized in time or frequency,
that couple into the gravitational-wave readout. Here we review the performance
of the LIGO instruments during this epoch, the work done to characterize the detectors and their data, and the eﬀect that transient and continuous noise artefacts
have on the sensitivity of LIGO to a variety of astrophysical sources.
PACS numbers: 04.80.Nn.
1. Introduction
Between July 2009 and October 2010, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave
Observatory (LIGO) operated two 4-kilometre laser interferometers as part of a
global network aiming to detect and study gravitational waves (GWs) of astrophysical
These detectors, at LIGO Hanford Observatory, WA (LHO), and LIGO
Livingston Observatory, LA (LLO) – dubbed ‘H1’ and ‘L1’, and operating beyond
their initial design with greater sensitivity – took data during Science Run 6 (S6) in
collaboration with GEO600 and Virgo .
The data from each of these detectors have been searched for GW signals from
a number of sources, including compact binary coalescences (CBCs) , generic
short-duration GW bursts , non-axisymmetric spinning neutron stars , and a
stochastic GW background (SGWB) . The performance of each of these analyses
is measured by the searched volume of the universe multiplied by the searched time
duration; however, long and short duration artefacts in real data, such as narrowbondwidth noise lines and glitches, further restrict the sensitivity of GW searches.
Searches for transient GW signals including CBCs and GW bursts are sensitive to
many short-duration noise events (glitches), coming from a number of environmental,
mechanical, and electronic mechanisms that are not fully understood. Each search
pipeline employs signal-based methods to distinguish a GW event from noise based
on knowledge of the expected waveform , but also relies on careful
studies of the detector behaviour to provide information that leads to improved data
quality through ‘vetoes’ that remove data likely to contain noise artefacts. Searches
for long-duration continuous waves (CWs) and a SGWB are sensitive to disturbances
from spectral lines and other sustained noise artefacts. These eﬀects cause elevated
noise at a given frequency and so impair any search over these data.
This paper describes the work done to characterize the LIGO detectors and their
data during S6, and estimates the increase in sensitivity for analyses resulting from
detector improvements and data quality vetoes.
This work follows from previous
studies of LIGO data quality during Science Run 5 (S5) and S6 .
Similar studies have also been performed for the Virgo detector relating to data taking
during Virgo Science Runs (VSRs) 2, 3 and 4 .

were identiﬁed at each site and steps taken to mitigate them. In section 5, we present
the performance of data-quality vetoes when applied to each of two astrophysical
data searches: the ihope CBC pipeline and the Coherent WaveBurst (cWB)
burst pipeline .
A short conclusion is given in section 6, along with plans for
characterization of the next-generation Advanced LIGO detectors, currently under
construction.
2. Conﬁguration of the LIGO detectors during the sixth science run
The ﬁrst-generation LIGO instruments were versions of a Michelson interferometer 
with Fabry-Perot arm cavities, with which GW amplitude is measured as a strain of
the 4-kilometre arm length, as shown in ﬁg. 1 . In this layout, a diode-pumped,
power-ampliﬁed Nd:YAG laser generated a carrier beam in a single longitudinal mode
at 1064 nm . This beam passed through an electro-optic modulator which added a
pair of radio-frequency (RF) sidebands used for sensing and control of the test mass
positions, before the modulated beam entered a triangular optical cavity. This cavity
(the ‘input mode cleaner’) was conﬁgured to ﬁlter out residual higher-order spatial
modes from the main beam before it entered the main interferometer.
The conceptual Michelson design was enhanced with the addition of input test

masses at the beginning of each arm to form Fabry-Perot optical cavities.
cavities increase the storage time of light in the arms, eﬀectively increasing the arm
length. Additionally, a power-recycling mirror was added to reﬂect back light returned
towards the input, equivalent to increasing the input laser power. During S5, the
relative lengths of each arm were controlled to ensure that the light exiting each arm
cavity interfered destructively at the output photodiode, and all power was returned
towards the input. In such ‘dark fringe’ operation, the phase modulation sidebands
induced in the arms by interaction with GWs would interfere constructively at the
output, recording a GW strain in the demodulated signal. In this conﬁguration, the
LIGO instruments achieved their design sensitivity goal over the 2-year S5 run. A
thorough description of the initial design is given in .
For S6 a number of new systems were implemented to improve sensitivity
and to prototype upgrades for the second-generation Advanced LIGO (aLIGO)
detectors . The initial input laser system was upgraded from a 10 W output
to a maximum of 35 W, with the installation of new master ring oscillator and power
ampliﬁer systems . The higher input laser power from this system improved the
sensitivity of the detectors at high frequencies (> 150 Hz) and allowed prototyping of
several key components for the aLIGO laser system . Additionally, an improved
CO2-laser thermal-compensation system was installed to counteract thermal
lensing caused by expansion of the test mass coating substrate due to heat from
absorption of the main beam.
An alternative GW detection system was installed,
replacing the initial
heterodyne readout scheme . A special form of homodyne detection, known as
DC readout, was implemented, whereby the interferometer is operated slightly away
from the dark fringe. In this system, GW-induced phase modulations would interfere
with the main beam to produce power variations on the output photodiode, without
the need for demodulating the output signal. In order to improve the quality of the
light incident on the output photodiode in this new readout system, an output mode
cleaner (OMC) cavity was installed to ﬁlter out the higher-order mode content of
the output beam , including the RF sidebands. The OMC was required to be
in-vacuum, but also highly stable, and so a single-stage prototype of the new aLIGO
two-stage seismic isolation system was installed for the output optical platform ,
from which the OMC was suspended.
Futhermore, controls for seismic feed-forward to a hydraulic actuation system
were improved at LLO to combat the higher level of seismic noise at that site .
This system used signals from seismometers at the Michelson vertex, and at ends of
each of the arms, to suppress the eﬀect of low-frequency (≲10 Hz) seismic motion on
the instrument.
3. Detector sensitivity during S6
The maximum sensitivity of any GW search, such as those cited in section 1,
is determined by the amount of coincident multi-detector operation time and
astrophysical reach of each detector. In searches for transient signals these factors
determine the number of sources that could be detected during a science run, while in
those for continuous signals they determine the accumulated signal power over that
The S6 run took place between July 7th 2009 and October 20th 2010, with each
detector recording over seven months of data in that period. The data-taking was

split into four epochs, A–D, identifying distinct analysis periods set by changes in
detector performance or the detector network itself. Epochs A and B ran alongside the
second Virgo Science Run (VSR2) before that detector was taken oﬀ-line for a major
upgrade . S6A ran for ∼2 months before a month-long instrumental commissioning
break, and S6B ran to the end of 2009 before another commissioning break. The ﬁnal
2 epochs, C and D, spanned a continuous period of detector operation, over nine
months in all, with the distinction marking the start of VSR3 and the return of a
three-detector network.
Instrumental stability over these epochs was measured by the detector duty factor
– the fraction of the total run time during which science-quality data was recorded.
Each continuous period of operation is known as a science segment, deﬁned as time
when the interferometer is operating in a nominal state and the spectral sensitivity
is deemed acceptable by the operator and scientists on duty.
A science segment
is typically ended by a critically large noise level in the instrument at which time
interferometer control cannot be maintained by the electronic control system (known
as lock-loss). However, a small number of segments are ended manually during clean
data in order to perform scheduled maintenance, such as a calibration measurement.
Figure 2 shows a histogram of science segment duration over the run. The majority of
segments span several hours, but there are a signiﬁcant number of shorter segments,
symptomatic of interferometer instability. In particular, for L1 the number of shorter
segments is higher than that for H1, a result of poor detector stability during the early
part of the run, especially during S6B.
Table 1 summarises the science segments for each site over the four run epochs.
Both sites saw an increase in duty factor, that of H1 increasing by ∼15 percentage
points, and L1 by nearly 20 between epochs A and D. Additionally, the median
duration of a single science-quality data segment more than doubled at both sites
between the opening epochs (S6A and S6B) and the end of the run. These increases in
stability highlight the developments in understanding of the critical noise couplings 
and how they aﬀect operation of the instruments (see section 4 for some examples),

as well as improvements in the control system used to maintain cavity resonance.
The sensitivity to GWs of a single detector is typically measured as a strain
amplitude spectral density of the calibrated detector output. This is determined by a
combination of noise components, some fundamental to the design of the instruments,
and some from additional noise coupling from instrumental and environmental sources.
Figure 3 shows the typical amplitude spectral densities of the LIGO detectors
during S6. The dominant contribution below 40 Hz is noise from seismically-driven
motion of the key interferometer optics, and from the servos used to control their
alignment.
The reduced level of the seismic wall at L1 relative to H1 can be, in
part, attributed to the prototype hydraulic isolation installed at that observatory .
Intermediate frequencies, 50-150 Hz, have signiﬁcant contributions from Brownian
motion – mechanical excitations of the test masses and their suspensions due to
thermal energy – however, some of the observed limiting noise in this band was
never understood. Above 150 Hz, shot noise due to variation in incident photon ﬂux

at the output port is the dominant fundamental noise source . The sensitivity
is also limited at many frequencies by narrow-band line structures, described in
detail in section 4.7. The spectral sensitivity gives a time-averaged view of detector
performance, and so is sensitive to the long-duration noise sources and signals, but
rather insensitive to transient events.
A standard measure of a detector’s astrophysical reach is the distance to which
that instrument could detect GW emission from the inspiral of a binary neutron
star system with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 8 , averaged over source sky
locations and orientations. Figure 4 shows the evolution of this metric over the science
run, with each data point representing an average over 2048 s of data. Over the course
of the run, the detection range of H1 increased from ∼16 to ∼20 Mpc, and of L1 from
∼14 to ∼20 Mpc. The instability of S6B at L1 can be seen between days 80–190, with
a lower duty factor (also seen in table 1) and low detection range; this period included
extensive commissioning of the seismic feed-forward system at LLO .
The combination of increased amplitude sensitivity and improved duty factor over
the course of S6 meant that the searchable volume of the universe for an astrophysical
analysis was greatly increased.
4. Data-quality problems in S6
While the previous section described the performance of the LIGO detectors over the
full span of the S6 science run, there were a number of isolated problems that had
detrimental eﬀects on the performance of each of the observatories at some time. Each
of these problems, some of which are detailed below, introduced excess noise at speciﬁc
times or frequencies that hindered astrophysical searches over the data.
Under ideal conditions, all excess noise sources can be quickly identiﬁed in the
experimental set-up and corrected, either with a hardware change, or a modiﬁcation of
LIGO Detector Characterization in S6
the control system. However, not all such ﬁxes can be implemented immediately, or at
all, and so noisy periods in auxiliary data (other data streams not directly associated
with gravitational-wave readout) must be noted and recorded as likely to adversely
aﬀect the GW data. During S6, these data quality (DQ) ﬂags and their associated
time segments were used by analysis groups to inform decisions on which data to
analyse, or which detection candidates to reject as likely noise artefacts, the impact
of which will be discussed in section 5.
The remainder of this section details a representative set of speciﬁc issues that
were present for some time during S6 at LHO or LLO, some of which were ﬁxed at the
source, some which were identiﬁed but could not be ﬁxed, and one which was never
identiﬁed.
4.1. Seismic noise
Throughout the ﬁrst-generation LIGO experiment, the impact of seismic noise was a
fundamental limit to the sensitivity to GWs below 40 Hz. However, throughout S6
(and earlier science runs), seismic noise was also observed to be strongly correlated
with transient noise glitches in the detector output, not only at low frequencies, but
also at much higher frequencies (∼100-200 Hz).
The top panels of ﬁg. 5 show the seismic ground motion at LHO, both in speciﬁc
frequency bands (left) and as seen by the Ω-pipeline transient search algorithm 
(right) - this panel shows localised seismic noise events in time and frequency
coloured by their SNR. The lower left and right panels show transient events in
the gravitational-wave strain data as recorded by single-interferomter burst and CBC
inspiral searches respectively.
Critically, during periods of high seismic noise, the
inspiral analysis ‘daily ihope’ produced candidate event triggers across the full
range of signal templates, severely limiting the sensitivity of that search.
While great eﬀorts were made to reduce the coupling of seismic noise into the
interferometer , additional eﬀorts were required to improve the identiﬁcation of
loud transient seismic events that were likely to couple into the GW readout .
Such times were recorded and used by astrophysical search groups to veto candidate
events from analyses, proving highly eﬀective in reducing the noise background of such
4.2. Seismically-driven length-sensing glitches
While transient seismic noise was a problem throughout the science run, during late
2009 the presence of such noise proved critically disruptive at LLO. During S6B, the
majority of glitches in L1 were correlated with noise in the length control signals of
two short length degrees of freedom: the power recycling cavity length (PRCL), and
the short Michelson formed by the beam-splitter and the input test masses (MICH).
Both of these length controls were glitching simultaneously, and these glitches were
correlated with more than 70% of the glitches in the GW data.
It was discovered that high microseismic noise was driving large instabilities in the
power recycling cavity that caused signiﬁcant drops in the circulating power, resulting
in large glitches in both the MICH and PRC length controls. These actuation signals,
applied to the main interferometer optics, then coupled into the detector output.
This issue was eliminated via commissioning of a seismic feed-forward system 
that decreased the PRC optic motion by a factor of three. The glitchy data before the

ﬁx were identiﬁed by both the HierarchichalVeto (HVeto) and Used Percentage Veto
(UPV) algorithms – used to rank auxiliary signals according to the statistical
signiﬁcance of glitch coincidence with the GW data – with those times used by the
searches to dismiss noise artefacts from their results (more in section 5).
4.3. Upconversion of low-frequency noise due to the Barkhausen eﬀect
In earlier science runs, as well as aﬀecting performance below 40 Hz, increased levels
of ground motion below 10 Hz had been associated with increases in noise in the 40–
200 Hz band. This noise, termed seismic upconversion noise, was produced by passing
trucks, distant construction activities, seasonal increases in water ﬂow over dams, high
wind, and earthquakes . During S6, this noise was often the limiting
noise source at these higher frequencies. Figure 6 shows a reduction in the sensitive
range to binary neutron star (BNS) inspirals, contemporaneous with the workday
increase in anthropogenic seismic noise.
Experiments

upconversion
correlated better with the amplitudes of the currents to the electromagnets that held
the test masses in place as the ground moved than with the actual motion of the test
masses or of the ground. An empirical, frequency-dependent function was developed
to estimate upconversion noise from the low-frequency test mass actuation currents.
This function was used to produce ﬂags that indicated time periods that were expected
to have high levels of seismic upconversion noise.
In addition to average reductions in sensitivity, upconverted seismic noise
transients further reduced sensitivity to unmodelled GW bursts.
Figure 7 shows
that the rate of low-SNR glitches in the GW data – in a frequency band above
that expected from linear seismic noise coupling – was correlated with the test mass
actuation current, suggesting that seismic upconversion was the source of a low-SNR
LIGO Detector Characterization in S6
Figure 7: Correlation between low SNR glitches in the GW data, and current in the
test mass coil at H1. The r2 value measures the normalized cross-correlation
through a least-squares ﬁt. This correlation is indicative of the Barkhausen
noise background that limited GW burst detection.
Investigations found that seismic upconversion noise bursts were clustered in
periods of high slope in the amplitude of the magnetic actuator current. This was
evidence that the seismic upconversion noise was Barkhausen noise : magnetic ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations produced by avalanches of magnetic domains in ferromagnetic materials
that occur when the domains align with changing magnetic ﬁelds. The Barkhausen
noise hypothesis was supported by investigations in which the noise spectrum was
reproduced by magnetic ﬁelds that were generated independently of the system.
These investigations also suggested that the putative source of the Barkhausen
noise was near or inside the test mass actuators. It was originally thought that the
source of this upconversion noise was Barkhausen noise from NbFeB magnets, but a
swap to less noisy SmCo magnets did not signiﬁcantly reduce the noise . However,
it was found that fasteners inside the magnetic actuator, made of grade 303 steel, were
ferromagnetic, probably because they were shaped or cut when cold. For aLIGO, grade
316 steel, which is much less ferromagnetic after cold working, is being used at the
most sensitive locations.
4.4. Beam jitter noise
As described previously, one of the upgrades installed prior to S6 was the output
mode cleaner, a bow-tie-shaped cavity designed to ﬁlter out higher-order modes of the
main laser beam before detection at the output photodiode. As known from previous
experiments at GEO600 , the mode transmission of this cavity is very sensitive to
angular ﬂuctuations of the incident beam, whereby misalignment of the beam would
LIGO Detector Characterization in S6
cause non-linear power ﬂuctuations of the transmitted light .
At LIGO, low-frequency seismic noise and vibrations of optical tables were
observed to mix with higher-frequency beam jitter on the OMC to produce noise
sidebands around the main jitter frequency. The amplitude of these sidebands was
unstable, changing with the amount of alignment oﬀset, resulting in transient noise
at these frequencies, the most sensitive region of the LIGO spectrum, as seen in
ﬁg. 5 (bottom left panel).
Mitigation of these glitches involved modiﬁcations of
the suspension system for the auxiliary optics steering the beam into the OMC, to
minimise the coupling of optical table motion to beam motion. Additionally, several
other methods were used to mitigate and control beam jitter noise throughout the
run: full details are given in .
4.5. Mechanical glitching at the reﬂected port
While the problems described up to this point have been inherent to the design or
construction of either interferometer, the following two issues were both caused by
electronics failures associated with the LHO interferometer.
The ﬁrst of these was produced by faults in the servo actuators used to stabilize
the pointing of the beam at the reﬂected port of the interferometer. This position is
used to sense light reﬂected from the PRC towards the input, and generate control
signals to correct for arm-cavity motion. The resulting glitches coupled strongly into
the gravitational-wave data at ∼37 Hz and harmonics.
The source of the glitches was identiﬁed with the help of HVeto, which discovered
that a number of angular and length sensing channels derived from photodiodes at
the reﬂected port were strongly coupled with events in the GW data. Figure 8 shows
the broad peaks in the spectra of one length sensing channel and the un-calibrated
GW readout compared to a quiet reference time. On top of this, accelerometer signals
from the optical table at the reﬂected port were found to be coupling strongly, having
weak but coincident glitches.
These accelerometer coincidences indicated that the glitches were likely produced
by mechanical motions of steering mirrors resulting from a faulty piezoelectric
actuation system. Because of this, this servo was decomissioned for the rest of the
run, leading to an overall improvement in data quality.
4.6. Broadband noise bursts from poor electrical connections
The second of the electronics problems caused repeated, broadband glitching in the
LHO GW readout towards the end of S6. Periods of glitching would last from minutes
to hours, and greatly reduced the instrumental sensitivity over a large frequency range,
as shown in ﬁg. 9.
The main diagnostic clues were coincident, but louder, glitches in a set of quadrant
photo-diodes (QPDs) sensing beam motion in the OMC. It was unlikely that these
sensors could detect a glitch in the beam more sensitively than the GW readout photodiode, and so the prime suspect then became the electronics involved with recording
data from these QPDs.
In the process of isolating the cause, several other electronics boards in the output
mode cleaner were inspected, re-soldered, and swapped for spares. The problem was
ﬁnally solved by re-soldering the connections on the electronics board that provided
the high-voltage power supply to drive a piezoelectric transducer.

panel shows the spectrum as a noisy period (red) in comparison with a
reference taken from clean data (green).
4.7. Spectral lines
Just as searches for transient signals are limited by instrumental glitches, so too our
searches for steady signals are limited by a number of instrumental narrow-band
peaks representing speciﬁc frequencies at which noise was elevated for a signiﬁcant
amount of time, in many cases for the entire science run. Many spectral lines are
fundamental to the design and operation of the observatories, including alternating
current (AC) power lines from the U.S. mains supply, at 60 Hz; violin modes from
core-optic suspensions, around 350 Hz; and various calibration lines used to measure
the interferometer response function.
Each of these features can be seen in ﬁg. 3 at their fundamental frequency and a
number of harmonics; however, also seen are a large number of lines from unintended
sources, such as magnetic and vibrational couplings. These noise lines can have a
damaging eﬀect on any search for GWs if the frequencies of the incoming signal and of
the lines overlap for any time; this is especially troublesome for searches for continuous
gravitational-wave emitters.
Throughout S6, series of lines were seen at both observatories as 2 Hz and 16 Hz

the output photo-detector.
These lines were a serious concern for both the CW
and SGWB searches due to their appearance at both observatories , leading to

contamination of the coincidence-based searches for CW sources. Commissioning work
on the OMC control system at LHO in early 2010 suggested that the use of a speciﬁc
set of high-frequency (> 1 kHz) dither signals resulted in low-frequency noise generated
by the digital-to-analog converters (DACs), but although resulting modiﬁcations to
the controls scheme removed the 2 Hz series at that site, this hypothesis was never
A number of other lines were isolated at either observatory site , and while
not discussed in detail here, the cumulative eﬀect of all spectral lines on searches for
long-duration gravitational-wave sources is discussed in detail in section 5.
4.8. The ‘spike’ glitch
The spike glitch was the name given to a class of very loud transients seen in the L1
instrument. They were characterized by a distinctive shape in the time series of the
signal on the GW output photodiode, beginning with a rapid but smooth dip (lasting
∼1 ms) before a period of damped oscillation lasting ∼3 milliseconds, as shown in
Figure 11. The amplitude of these glitches was extremely large, often visible in the
raw time-series (which is normally dominated by low-frequency seismic motion), with
the Ω-pipeline typically resolving these events with SNRs ranging from 200 to well
over 20,000.
The size and rapidity of the initial glitch suggested that the source was after
the beams had re-combined at the beam-splitter before detection at the readout
photodiode. The damped oscillations after the initial dip, however, were likely due
to the response of the length control loop of the interferometer, meaning an actual or
apparent sudden dip in the light on the output photodiode could explain the entire
shape of the spike glitch. To investigate this possibility, the interferometer was run in a
conﬁguration where the light did not enter the arm cavities, but went almost directly
into the OMC, removing the length and angular control servos from consideration.
Sharp downward dips in the light were seen during this test, although they were 0.2
milliseconds wide, much narrower than the initial dips of the spike glitches.
Despite this investigation and many others, the cause of the spike glitch was never
determined. However, these glitches were clearly not of astrophysical origin, and were
not coherent with similar events in H1, allowing the CBC signal search to excise them
from analyses by vetoing time around glitches detected in L1 with unreasonably high
SNR. For future science runs, Advanced LIGO will consist of almost entirely new
hardware, so whether the spike glitch or something very similar will be seen in new
data remains to be seen.
5. The impact of data quality on gravitational wave searches
The impact of non-Gaussian, non-stationary noise in the LIGO detectors on searches
for GWs is signiﬁcant. Such loud glitches, such as the spike glitch, can mask or greatly
disrupt transient GW signals present in the data at the same time, while high rates
of lower SNR glitches can signiﬁcantly increase the background in searches for these
sources. Additionally, spectral lines and continued glitching in a given frequency range
reduces the sensitivity of searches for long-duration signals at those frequencies. Both
long- and short-duration noise sources have a notable eﬀect on search sensitivity if not
mitigated.

the glitch in context with 10 s of data, while the bottom shows the glitch
proﬁle as described in the text.
Non-Gaussian noise in the detector outputs that can be correlated with auxiliary
signals that have negligible sensitivity to GWs can be used to create ﬂags for noisy
data; these ﬂags can then be used in astrophysical searches to remove artefacts and
improve sensitivity. With transient noise, the ﬂags are used to identify time segments
in which the data may contain glitches.
Similarly, spectral lines are recorded as
frequencies, or narrow frequency bands, at which the detector sensitivity is reduced.
5.1. Data quality vetoes for transient searches
In this section, the impact of noisy data is measured by its eﬀect on the primary
analyses of the LIGO-Virgo transient search groups :
• the low-mass CBC search ‘ihope’ is a coincidence-based analysis in which data
from each detector are ﬁltered against a bank of binary inspiral template signals,
producing an SNR time-series for each. Peaks in SNR across multiple detectors
are considered coincident if the separation in time and matched template masses
are small . This analysis also uses a χ2-statistic test to down-rank signals
with high SNR but a spectral shape signiﬁcantly diﬀerent to that of the matched
template .
• the all-sky cWB algorithm calculates a multi-detector statistic by clustering
time-frequency pixels with signiﬁcant energy that are coherent across the detector
In both cases, the multi-detector events identiﬁed are then subject to a number of
consistency tests before being considered detection candidates.
The background of each search is determined by relatively shifting the data from
multiple detectors in time. These time shifts are much greater than the time taken for
a GW to travel between sites, ensuring that any multi-detector events in these data
cannot have been produced by a single astrophysical signal.

Table 2: Summary of the reduction in all time and analysable time by category 1 veto
segments during S6
Although both searches require signal power in at least two detectors, strong
glitches in a single detector coupled with Gaussian noise in others still contributed
signiﬁcantly to the search background during S6. DQ ﬂags were highly eﬀective in
removing these noise artefacts from the analyses. The eﬀect of a time-domain DQ ﬂag
can be described by its deadtime, the fraction of analysis time that has been vetoed;
and its eﬃciency, the fractional number of GW candidate events removed by a veto
in the corresponding deadtime.
Flag performances are determined by their eﬃciency-to-deadtime ratio (EDR);
random ﬂagging and vetoing of data gives EDR ≃1, whereas eﬀective removal of
glitches gives a much higher value. Additionally, the used percentage – the fraction
of auxiliary channel glitches which coincide with a GW candidate event – allows a
measure of the strength of the correlation between the auxiliary and GW channel
Each search group chose to apply a unique set of DQ ﬂags in order to minimise
deadtime whilst maximising search sensitivity; for example, the CBC search teams
did not use a number of ﬂags correlated with very short, high-frequency disturbances,
as these do not trigger their search algorithm, while these ﬂags were used in searches
for unmodelled GW bursts.
We present the eﬀect of three categories of veto on each of the above searches in
terms of reduction in analysable time and removal of noise artefacts from the search
backgrounds. Only brief category deﬁnitions are given, for full descriptions see .
5.1.1. Category 1 vetoes.
The most egregious interferometer performance problems
are ﬂagged as category 1.
These ﬂags denote times during data taking when the
instrument was not running under the designed conﬁguration, and so should not be
included in any analysis.
The Data Monitoring Tool (DMT) automatically identiﬁed certain problems in
real time, including losses of cavity resonance, and errors in the h(t) calibration.
Additionally, scientists monitoring detector operation in the control room at each
observatory manually ﬂagged individual time segments that contained observed
instrumental issues and errors.
All LIGO-Virgo search groups used category 1 vetoes to omit unusable segments
of data; as a result their primary eﬀect was in the reduction in analysable time over
which searches were performed.
This impact is magniﬁed by search requirements
on the duration for analysed segments, with the cWB and ihope searches requiring a
minimum of 316 and 2064 seconds of contiguous data respectively. Table 2 outlines the
absolute deadtime (fraction of science-quality data removed) and the search deadtime
(fractional reduction in analysable time after category 1 vetoes and segment selection).
At both sites the amount of science-quality time ﬂagged as category 1 is less than half of
one percent, highlighting the stability of the instrument and its calibration. However,
LIGO Detector Characterization in S6
the deadtime introduced by segment selection is signiﬁcantly higher, especially for the
CBC analysis. The long segment duration requirement imposed by the ihope pipeline
results in an order of magnitude increase in search deadtime relative to absolute
Categories 2 and 3.
The higher category ﬂags were used to identify likely
noise artefacts. Category 2 veto segments were generated from auxiliary data whose
correlation with the GW readout has been ﬁrmly demonstrated by instrumental
commissioning and investigations. Category 3 includes veto segments from less well
understood statistical correlations between noisy data in an auxiliary channel and
the GW readout. Both the ihope and cWB search pipelines produce a ﬁrst set of
candidate event triggers after application of category 2 vetoes, and a reduced set after
application of category 3.
The majority of category 2 veto segments were generated in low-latency by the
DMT and include things like photodiode saturations, digital overﬂows, and high
seismic and other environmental noise.
At category 3, the HVeto , UPV ,
and bilinear-coupling veto (BCV) algorithms were used, by the burst and CBC
analyses respectively, to identify coupling between auxiliary data and the GW readout.
Table 3 gives the absolute, relative, and cumulative deadtimes of these categories
after applying category 1 vetoes and segment selection criteria, outlining the amount
of analysed time during which event triggers were removed.
As with category 1,
category 2 vetoes have deadtime O(1)%, but with signiﬁcantly higher application at
L1 compared to H1. This is largely due to one ﬂag vetoing the ﬁnal 30 seconds before
a lock-loss combined with the relative abundance of short data-taking segments for
L1. Additionally, photodiode saturations and computational timing errors were more
prevalent at the LLO site than at LHO and so contribute to higher relative deadtime.
Category 3 ﬂags contributed O(10)% deadtime for each instrument. While this
level of deadtime is relatively high, as we shall see, the eﬃciency of these ﬂags in
removing background noise events makes such cuts acceptable to the search groups.

by category 2 and 3 veto segments during S6.
The relative deadtime is
the additional time removed by category 3 not vetoed by category 2, and
cumulative deadtime gives the total time removed from the analysis.
Figure 12 shows the eﬀect of category 3 vetoes on the background events from the
cWB pipeline; these events were identiﬁed in the background from time time-slides
and are plotted using the SNR reconstructed at each detector. This search applies
category 2 vetoes in memory, and does not record any events before this step, so
eﬃciency statements are only available for category 3. The results are shown after
the application of a number of network- and signal-consistency checks internal to the
pipeline that reject a large number of the loud events. As a result, the background is

dominated by low SNR events, with a small number of loud outliers. At both sites,
DQ vetoes applied to this search have cumulative EDR ≥5 at SNR 3, with those at L1
removing the tail above SNR 20. However, despite the reduction, this search was still
severely limited by the remaining tail in the multi-detector background distribution .
Figure 13 shows the eﬀect of category 2 and 3 vetoes on the background from
the CBC ihope pipeline; this search sees a background extending to higher SNR. As
shown, the background is highly suppressed by DQ vetoes, with an eﬃciency of 50%
above SNR 8, and 80% above ∼100 at both sites. The re-weighted SNR statistic, as
deﬁned in , is highly eﬀective in down-ranking the majority of outliers with high
matched-ﬁlter SNR, but a non-Gaussian tail was still present at both sites. Category
3 vetoes successfully removed this tail, reducing the loudest event at H1 (L1) from a
re-weighted SNR of 16.0 (15.3) to 11.1 (11.2). Search sensitive distance was roughly
inversely proportional to the χ2-weighted SNR of the loudest event, and so reducing
the loudest event by ∼30% with ∼10% deadtime can be estimated as a factor of ∼2.5
increase in detectable event rate.
5.2. Data quality in searches for long-duration signals
In searches for both continuous GWs and a SGWB, the duration and stationarity of
data from each detector were the key factors in search sensitivity. These analyses
integrate over the entire science run in order to maximise the SNR of a low-amplitude
source. Accordingly, they were impacted only very little by infrequent glitches, but
were adversely aﬀected by spectral lines and long periods of glitching in a given
frequency band.

5.2.1. Searches for continuous GWs.
The PowerFlux pipeline is one method
used to conduct an all-sky search for GW signals from pulsars. This search, currently
in progress, has chosen the ﬁnal seven months of the S6 dataset in order to minimise
the impact of poor detector performance from the earlier epochs.
A preliminary analysis of the data has shown instrumental features at high
frequency causing the search sensitivity to drop towards that observed during S5.
In all, ∼20% of frequency bands, each a few hundred mHz wide, have been identiﬁed
as non-Gaussian, compared to almost zero in S5. Additionally, the noise due to beam
jitter (see section 4.4), has had a detrimental eﬀect on sensitivity around 180-200 Hz.
5.2.2. Searches for a SGWB.
For the S6 search for a SGWB, DQ cuts were made
to eliminate data in H1 and L1 that were too noisy, too non-stationary, or that had
apparent correlated noise between detectors‡. The analyses ran over times when both
LIGO detectors were taking science-quality data, excluding those times ﬂagged as
category 1 or category 4 veto segments.
The category 1 segments chosen for this
search caused a 2% reduction in coincident data for the LIGO detector pair.
In addition, up to 5.5% of data segments deviate from the stationary noise
assumption, depending on frequency.
These were removed from the analysis by
identifying segments whose standard deviation, σ, varies from neighbouring segments
by greater than 20%.
After applying all of the data quality cuts, ∼117 days of
‡ In the absence of a signal model, correlated noise and a GW signal are indistinguishable in a
stochastic search. However, a stochastic isotropic search assumes that the signal is broadband, and
so narrow-band line features can be considered to be of instrumental, usually electronic, origin.
LIGO Detector Characterization in S6
coincident live time for the LIGO network remained.
Spectral noise lines are also a problem for the SGWB search. It is improbable
to have a spectral noise line present in the same frequency bin (0.25 Hz) in both H1
and L1, but it is possible. In addition, a loud line in one detector can couple with a
noise ﬂuctuation in the other and produce an excess when the correlation is calculated
between the two data streams. In order to examine frequency bins for contamination,
the coherence between two interferometers was calculated,
|⟨P12(f)⟩|2
⟨P1(f)⟩⟨P2(f)⟩,
where ⟨P12(f)⟩is the average cross-spectral density and ⟨Pi(f)⟩is the power spectral
density for the ith interferometer.
This was used to identify high coherence bins,
searching at resolutions of 1 Hz and 100 mHz, using the method in . This identiﬁed
power line harmonics, 16 Hz harmonics from data acquisition, violin modes of the
interferometer mirror suspension, and injected calibration signals. These frequencies
were excluded from the analysis, as were some frequency bins where a clear association
with an environmentally produced noise line in either the H1 or L1 data could be made.
In total, 87 frequency bins (each 0.25 Hz wide, in the range from 40–1000 Hz) were
removed from the S6 LIGO SGWB search. The study of the coherence also revealed
a small amount (0.2%) of additional non-stationary time series data, and these were
In addition, the SGWB search pipeline was run over LIGO data after a nonphysical time-shift had been applied. The inspection of these data revealed further
frequency bins where the signal-to-noise ratio was greater than 4.25. If frequency bins
met this condition for at least 2 of the time shifted runs, they were removed from the
ﬁnal foreground analysis. This removed 7 more frequency bins.
Preliminary results from the S6 CW and SGWB searches indicate that these steps
have cleaned the data set, allowing more sensitive searches. However, the increased
non-stationarity and noise lines during S6 relative to S5 have produced a further
detrimental eﬀect on the data. The S6 CW searches can be expected to set better
upper limits on GW amplitudes than the S5 searches, nevertheless, spectral lines will
appear as potential sources for all-sky CW signal searches, and much work remains
to explain the source of these presumed noise lines. On the SGWB side, the S6 data
will provide a better upper limit as compared to the S5 results .
It should also be noted that correlated magnetic ﬁeld noise, from the Schumann
resonances, was observed in correlations between magnetometers at H1, L1 and Virgo.
However it was determined that the level of correlated noise did not eﬀect the S5 or
S6 stochastic searches .
6. Conclusions and outlook for Advanced LIGO
The LIGO instruments, at both Hanford and Livingston, are regularly aﬀected by
both non-Gaussian noise transients and long-duration spectral features. Throughout
S6 a number of problems were identiﬁed as detrimental to stable and sensitive datataking at the observatories, as well as to the astrophysical searches performed on the
Instrumental ﬁxes employed throughout the science run resulted in increasingly
stable and sensitive instruments. Median segment duration and overall duty factor
LIGO Detector Characterization in S6
improved from epoch to epoch (table 1) and the detection range to the canonical binary
neutron star inspiral increased by a signiﬁcant factor (ﬁg. 4). Data quality ﬂags, used
to identify known correlations between noise in auxiliary systems and the GW data,
allowed for a signiﬁcant reduction in the event background of both core transient
searches, ihope and cWB (ﬁgs. 12 and 13). An eﬃciency-to-deadtime ratio above 5
for both searches, at both sites, allowed for a signiﬁcant increase in the sensitivity of
the search, improving the upper limits on event rate for both CBC and generic GW
burst sources.
However, a tail of high SNR events was still present in the cWB search for GW
bursts, requiring deeper study of the glitch morphology and improved identiﬁcation
methods. Additionally, the presence of noise lines outside the instrumental design
had a detrimental, but not debilitating, eﬀect on searches for long-duration signals.
A large number of these remaining transient and long-duration noise sources are still
undiagnosed, meaning a large eﬀort must be undertaken to mitigate similar eﬀects in
the second-generation instruments.
The ﬁrst-generation LIGO instruments were decommissioned shortly following
the end of the science run (although immediately after S6 shot noise reduction was
demonstrated in the H1 interferometer by using squeezed states of light ), and
installation and early testing of aLIGO systems is now under way . With the next
data-taking run scheduled for 2015 , many methods and tools developed during
the last run are set to be upgraded to further improve instrument and data quality.
Improvements are in place for each of the noise event detection algorithms, allowing for
more accurate detection of transient noise in all channels, and work is ongoing for the
HVeto and UPV statistical veto generators to enable more eﬃcient identiﬁcation
of sources of noise in the GW data. In addition, multi-variate statistical classiﬁers are
being developed for use in glitch identiﬁcation , using more information produced
from event triggers to improve veto eﬃciency and identiﬁcation of false alarms with
minimal deadtime.
One of the major goals of the aLIGO project is to contribute to multi-messenger
astronomy – the collaboration between GW observatories and electromagnetic (EM)
and neutrino observatories . Both the burst and CBC search working groups
are developing low-latency analyses from which to trigger followup with partner EM
telescopes, requiring a much greater eﬀort in low-latency characterisation of the data.
With this in mind, a large part of the development in detector characterisation
in the LIGO Scientiﬁc Collaboration (LSC) is now being devoted to real-time
characterisation of instrumental data, including the GW output and all auxiliary
channels. An Online Detector Characterisation system is being developed for aLIGO
that summarises the status of all instrumental and environmental systems in real-time
to allow fast identiﬁcation of false alarms in these on-line analyses, and reduce the
latency of EM follow-up requests.
Best estimates predict ∼40 detections of GWs from binary neutron star mergers
per year at design sensitivity , assuming stationary, Gaussian noise. A great eﬀort
will be required in commissioning the new instruments to achieve these goals, including
detailed characterisation of their performance before the start of the ﬁrst advanced
observing run.
