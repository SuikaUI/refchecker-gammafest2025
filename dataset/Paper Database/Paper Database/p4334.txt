Intrapartum uterine activity and neonatal
outcomes: a systematic review

, Michael P. Geary2 and Breda C. Hayes1
Background: Increased uterine activity (UA) may not allow adequate recovery time for foetal oxygenation.
Methods: The aim of the study was to determine if increased UA during labour is associated with an increased risk
of either short- or long-term neurological injury in term neonates, or with neonatal proxy measures of intrapartum
hypoxia-ischemia. MEDLINE, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched using the following terms: uterine activity,
excessive uterine activity, XSUA, uterine hyperstimulation, and tachysystole. Any study that analysed the relationship
between UA during term labour and neurological outcomes/selected proxy neurological outcomes was eligible for
inclusion. Outcomes from individual studies were reported in tables and presented descriptively with odds ratios
(OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and means with standard deviations for
continuous outcomes. Where group numbers were provided, ORs and their CIs were calculated according to
Main results: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies featured umbilical artery pH as an individual
outcome. Umbilical artery base excess and Apgar scores were both reported as individual outcomes in four studies.
No study examined long term neurodevelopmental outcomes and only one study reported on encephalopathy as
an outcome. The evidence for a relationship between UA and adverse infant outcomes was inconsistent. The
reported estimated effect size varied from non-existent to clinically significant.
Conclusions: There is some evidence that increased UA may be a non-specific predictor of depressed neurological
function in the newborn, but it is inconsistent and insufficient to support the conclusion that an association
generally exists.

Background
The rationale for the proposed link between excessive
uterine activity (UA) and fetal hypoxia is based on
physiological studies of the haemodynamic changes that
occur in the utero-placental and fetal circulations during
a contraction. As a uterine contraction progresses, the
amount of oxygenated blood delivered to the placenta
decreases. Thus, the lowest fetal oxygen saturation
percentage values are found towards the end of a
contraction and take some time to recover. Increased
contraction frequencies may not allow adequate recovery
time and may result in progressive reductions in fetal
oxygen levels .
There is evidence that tocolytic medications may improve fetal heart rate (FHR) abnormalities when used
while emergency delivery is pending . Compared to
emergent delivery, tocolysis for fetal distress may improve umbilical artery (UmA) base excess (BE) values
and reduce neonatal intensive care unit admission at the
expense of increasing caesarean delivery . A 2018
Cochrane review found several studies which showed an
improvement in fetal wellbeing in response to tocolysis

but concluded that, given the small sample sizes involved, “the clinical significance is unclear” .
Current guidelines are based on the opinion that when
there is an abnormal FHR pattern in association with frequent uterine contractions, increased UA may cause fetal
hypoxia . The 2014 American College of Obstetricians
and Gynaecologists (ACOG) guidelines, Neonatal Encephalopathy and Neurologic Outcome, define tachysystole
(TS) as more than five contractions in 10 min averaged
over a 30-min window, and state that TS should be treated
whenever it is associated with recurrent FHR decelerations
or if oxytocin is being administered . The UK National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on
labour management state that where the FHR pattern is
suspicious or pathological any uterine hyperstimulation
should be corrected . The authors are unaware of any
existing guidelines which address TS in unaugmented
labour without FHR abnormalities.
The aim of this systematic review is to determine if
increased UA during labour is associated with an increased
likelihood of either short- or long-term neurological injury
in term neonates, or with proxy neonatal measures of intrapartum hypoxia-ischemia.
The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO
(CRD4201705258) and followed the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRIS
MA) statement.
Search strategy
We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov
using terms related to UA (“uterine activity”, “excessive
uterine activity”, “XSUA”, “uterine hyperstimulation”, and
“tachysystole”). Due to concern about the impact of
changes in clinical practice over time, the search was limited to articles published after January 1st, 1996. Reference
lists of relevant papers were checked to identify further
papers for consideration. The results were de-duplicated
using COVIDENCE (Covidence systematic review software,
Veritas Health Innovation Ltd., Melbourne, Australia). The
search was repeated prior to final analysis.
Eligibility criteria
Eligibility criteria were pre-determined. Based on the anticipated heterogeneity and small size of the evidence
base, we opted for permissive eligibility criteria. Any
study that analysed the relationship between UA during
term labour and neurological outcomes or selected
proxy outcomes was eligible. The proxy outcomes were
selected because they are commonly used indicators of
intrapartum hypoxia-ischemia . Based on incomplete
reporting, conference abstracts were excluded. Studies
retrieved were screened by one author and potentially
eligible studies were then assessed by two team members
before a final inclusion decision.
Data extraction and evidence summary
A standardised form was used to extract data. Missing
returned. Outcomes from individual studies were reported in tables and presented descriptively with odds
ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and means with standard deviations
(SD) for continuous outcomes where available. Where
group numbers were provided, ORs and their CIs were
calculated according to Altman . Results adjusted
based on multivariate analysis were included as reported.
A post-hoc analysis of the relationship between uterine
activity and both FHR patterns and delivery mode was
also performed.
Quality assessment
The risk of bias was independently assessed by both
reviewers using The Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline
Network (SIGN) critical appraisal checklists but was not
used to exclude any results.
Funding was provided by The National Women and Infants
Health Programme (Ireland) and the Rotunda Foundation
(Registered Charity Number. 20079529).
Search results and study selection
Our search retrieved 1777 citations from MEDLINE,
CINAHL. (Table S1) Four additional articles were identified after review of references. The search result details
are specified in supplementary material. A search of
ClinicalTrials.gov did not reveal any unpublished but
otherwise eligible studies. Two conference abstracts with
possibly eligible results were identified but not included
owing to the incomplete nature of the reports .
After screening of abstracts, 21 articles were selected for
full-text review. Of these, nine were excluded .
Study characteristics
The characteristics of each included study are summarized in Table S2. Twelve studies met the inclusion
criteria . In five , the primary
analysis was grouped by exposure i.e. UA. In three , cases were identified and then selectively
matched to controls. For the other nine studies, all
eligible patients were recruited regardless of outcome
(median subject number: 1433 [interquartile range: 720–
8008, range: 430–50,335]). In three data was
collected prospectively with the primary purpose being
Reynolds et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 20:532
 
to compare UA to fetal outcomes. In two , data
was collected prospectively but the included studies were
secondary analyses. The data collected pertained to
labours from 1993 to 2015. Subjects were recruited in
North America (7 studies), Sweden, Turkey, Italy, The
Netherlands, and Ireland (1 study each).
Included labours were exclusively spontaneous and
unaugmented , exclusively induced/augmented , or mixed .
One study exclusively used measurements from
intra-uterine pressure catheters (IUPC). Three studies
 used external tocography data only. Two
studies reported using IUPC and external tocography but mainly external measurements. Six studies
 did not specify the measurement
technology.
Three studies used automated analysis. Four
studies used documentation recorded
during labour by the attending midwives The remainder
 reported retrospectively analysed recordings, the interpretation of which was stated to be blinded
in all except one .
The period of labour analysed varied significantly
between studies. Three did not explicitly
state the period included. Two analysed the
entire period from induction to delivery. One 
analysed data from the first 4 h after induction. The
remainder analysed a period leading up to delivery
(Bakker: last hour of 1st stage and total 2nd stage,
Hamilton: 4 h, Smith: ≤4 h, Heuser: ≥2 h, Jonsson: 2 h,
Palanisamy: 1 h) .
Eleven studies featured contraction rate as an individual exposure, with one reporting rate only as part of
a combined exposure with contraction duration. All
studies apart from Bakker et al. reported contraction rate
as either a dichotomised or categorised variable. Two
studies included contraction rate as a continuous variable. All studies reported dichotomised outcomes only apart from one study which reported
UmA pH and BE as continuous measures.
Six of the ten included studies published after 2008
adhered precisely or closely to the ACOG 2008 definition of TS i.e. more than five contractions in 10 min,
averaged over a 30-min window. Of the four that did

not follow the ACOG definition: Hayes et al. referred to
15-min contraction rates > 7, Mutlu Meydanli et al. reported a composite exposure which included the ACOG
definition along with any contraction longer than 2-min,
Bofill et al. required two consecutive 10-min windows
with ≥6 contractions each, and Stewart et al. reported
the maximum 10-min contraction rate .
Two studies included non-composite exposures
besides contraction rate. Stewart et al. reported the number
of contractions > 120 s. Bakker et al. reported on relaxation
time as well as contraction duration, amplitude, and
surface (mean and total), as well as Montevideo units, and
active planimeter units (mean).
Risk of bias within studies
Of the twelve included studies, three were classed as at
high risk of bias, six were classed as at medium risk, and
three were classed as at low risk. (Tables S3-S14).
Synthesis of results
The results of the individual studies are summarized in
Table S15.
Neurodevelopmental outcome
No studies were found which reported neurodevelopmental outcomes in relation to UA.
Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy
One study reported hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
(HIE) as an outcome. In Hayes et al. contraction rates
greater than 7 in 15 min were associated with an increased risk of neonatal encephalopathy (TS: 87/187
[46.5%], No TS: 120/457 [26.3%], OR: 2.44 [95% CI:
1.71–3.48], aOR: 2.07 [95% CI: 1.13 to 3.81]) .
Umbilical artery pH
Seven studies featured UmA pH as an individual outcome. Three rejected and four retained the null hypothesis that UA is not associated with UmA pH levels.
Jonsson et al. compared cases with UmA pH < 7.05 to
controls with pH ≥7.05 and 5-min Apgar scores ≥5 .
TTS in the last 2 hours before delivery was found to be
associated with the likelihood of an adverse outcome
(TS: 84/127 [66.1%], No TS: 132/469 [28.1%], OR: 4.99
[95% CI: 3.28–7.58]). Mutlu Meydanli et al. found that
TS was associated with a 7.1 (95% CI: 1.3–38.7) times
increase in the relative risk of a UA pH ≤7.15 in women
after misoprostol induction (Bishop’s score ≤4) .
Bakker et al. found that UmA pH levels ≤7.11 were associated with higher contractions per 10-min as measured
by intrauterine pressure catheters both in the first
(mean: 5.0 [SD: 0.7] versus 4.8 [0.7], p = 0.006) and
second stages (mean: 5.5 [SD: 0.9] versus 5.2 [0.9], p =
0.002) . Bofill et al. reported that TS after cervical
ripening was not associated with mean UmA pH levels
(≥3 episodes: 7.22 [SD: 0.08], No episodes: 7.22 [SD:
0.08], p = 0.435), or with the likelihood of an UmA pH <
7.0 (TS: 3/131 [2.3%], No TS: 8/631 [1.3%], OR: 1.83
[95% CI: 0.48–6.97]). Stewart et al. reported that the
maximum contraction rate in the first 4 hours after induction was not associated with an increased risk of
acidosis (≤4: 1/152 [1%], 5: 4/179 [2%], 6: 2/134 [1%], ≥7:
6/119 [5%], p for trend = 0.06, OR for > 5: 2.20 [95% CI:
0.71–6.81]). Mussi et al. found that the presence of TS
or prolonged contractions was not linearly correlated
with UmA pH (r = 0.006, p = 0.8) . Palanisamy et al.
found that TS in the last hour of labour was not associated with UmA pH levels (TS: 9/513 [1.8%], No TS: 140/
8067 [1.7%], OR: 1.01 [95% CI: 0.51–2.00]) .
Umbilical Artery Base excess
Four studies tested whether UmA BE was linked to UA
with two rejecting the null hypothesis. Mussi et al. found
that the presence of TS or prolonged contractions was
not linearly correlated with the UmA BE (r = 0.15, p =
0.07). Hamilton et al. compared labours with UA BE
<-12 to labours with UA BE >-8. The found that TS was
associated with acidaemia (TS: 138/1215 [11.4%], No TS:
178/2105 [8.5%], OR: 1.39 [95% CI: 1.10–1.75]) . In
those with TS, the duration of TS was not associated
with metabolic acidosis. Bofill et al. found that labours
with ≥3 20-min episodes of TS did not have lower mean
BE values than labours without TS (mean BE: -6.81 [SD:
4.18] versus −6.57 [4.0], p = 0.535). Palanisamy et al. reported that TS in the last hour before delivery was more
common in labours with a BE ≤-8 (TS: 33/513 [6.4%],
No TS: 315/8067 [3.9%], OR: 1.69 [95% CI: 1.17–2.45]).
Umbilical artery lactate
One study reported UmA lactate values. Palanisamy
et al. observed that UmA lactate values ≥4 were more
common when the last hour before delivery was complicated by TS .
Apgar score
Four of nine cohort studies included Apgar score as an
individual outcome. One rejected and three retained the
null hypothesis. Heuser at al. reported that documentation of > 5 contractions in 10 min averaged over 30 min
was associated with an increased rate of 5-min Apgar
scores < 7 (TS: 61/5363 [1.1%], No TS: 336/44972
[0.7%], OR: 1.53 [95% CI: 1.16–2.01]) . Stewart et al.
reported that maximum contraction rate was not associated with an increased risk of a five-minute Apgar ≤3
(≤4: 0/152 (0%), 5: 0/134 (0%), 6: 1/179 (1%), ≥7: 0/119
(0%), p for trend = 0.86) . Ahmed at al. found that
TS 20:532
 
window) was not associated with an Apgar score < 7 at
5 min (No TS: 14/7118 [0.2%], TS: 2/890 [0.2%], p =
0.897) . Bofill et al. reported that TS was not associated with median 5-min Apgar scores (≥3 TS episodes: 9
[IQR: 8–9], No TS: 9 [IQR: 8–9], p = 0.502) or with the
risk of 5-min Apgar scores ≤3 (≥3 TS episodes: 0/131
[0.0%], No TS: 3/631 [0.5%]) .
Composite outcomes
Two studies featured composite outcomes which were
composed of eligible outcomes but could not be separated based on available data. Smith et al. compared
cases with an UmA BE ≤10 mmol/L or a 5-min Apgar
score ≤6 to controls without those characteristics. Using
automated analysis of external tocography recordings
from up to 4 h before delivery, they found that TS
regardless of duration was not more common in cases
than controls (No TS: 66/5095 [1.3%], Any TS: 11/1139
[1.0%], p = 0.45) . Mussi et al. found that TS or
prolonged contractions were not associated with either a
UmA pH < 7.1 or a UmA BE >-10 (No TS: 11/339
[3.2%], TS: 5/91 [5.5%], p = 0.35).
Figure 2 shows unadjusted odds ratios for each dichotomous outcome in the presence of TS. Mutlu Meydanli
et al. was excluded from the graph as group numbers
were not reported.
Fetal heart rate assessments
Three of the twelve included studies compared FHR
patterns in labours with TS to those without TS. All
rejected the null hypothesis. Stewart et al. reported that
the maximum 10-min contraction rate was related to
the presence of variable, late, or prolonged decelerations
(Any decelerations: ≤4: 61/152 [40%], 5: 88/179 [49%], 6:
77/134 [57%], ≥7: 69/119 [58%] p for trend < 0.0.001,
OR for > 5: 1.67 [95% CI: 1.20–2.32]). Ahmed et al.
found that the rate of non-reassuring FHR (NRFHR)
traces in labours with TS was higher than those labours
without TS (TS: 38/890 [4.3%], no TS: 179/7118 [2.5%],
OR: 1.73 [95% CI: 1.21–2.47]). Bofill et al. found higher
rates of NRFHR patterns with TS compared to without
(≥3 TS episodes: 28/131 [21%], No episodes: 91/631
[14%], OR: 1.61 [95% CI: 1.01–2.59]).
Uterine activity and delivery methods
Three of the included studies reported on TS in relation
to caesarean delivery for any indication. None found a
statistically significant association. Heuser at al. reported
that TS for any half hour period in the last 2 hours of
labour was not associated with caesarean delivery (TS:
670/5363 [12.5%], No TS: 5240/44972 [11.7%], OR: 1.08
[95% CI: 0.99–1.18]). Stewart at al. reported that TS in
the first 4 hours after induction was not associated with
caesarean delivery (TS: 43/253 [17.0%], No TS: 66/331

that TS at any stage after induction was not associated
with caesarean delivery (TS: 37/131 [28.2%], No TS:
215/631 [34.1%], OR: 0.76 [95% CI: 0.50–1.15]).
Two studies reported data on caesarean delivery for
FHR trace findings. Ahmed et al. found TS in spontaneous unaugmented labours to be associated with an
increased risk of caesarean delivery for NRFHR traces
(TS: 58/890 [6.5%], No TS: 318/7118 [4.5%], OR: 1.49
[95% CI: 1.12–1.99]). Mutlu Meydanli et al. reported a
statistically insignificant increase in the risk of caesarean
delivery for NRFHR traces (RR: 2.4 [95% CI: 0.6–9.4]).
Heuser et al. found that TS was associated with an
increased likelihood of operative vaginal delivery (TS:
682/5363 [12.7%], No TS: 3491/44972 [7.8%], OR: 1.73
[95% CI: 1.59–1.89]).
Results for exposures other than contraction rate
With regard to the last hour of the first stage, Bakker at al.
found that UmA pH < 7.11 was associated with average
relaxation times (cases: 51 s ± 23, controls: 63 s ± 35, p <
0.001), average Montevideo units (cases: 261 ± 86, controls:
236 ± 97, p = 0.02), and average active planimeter units
(cases: 9014 ± 2461, controls: 8379 ± 2740, p = 0.04), but not
with average contraction duration (cases: 87 s ± 9, controls:
87 s ± 10, p = 0.68), average contraction amplitude (cases: 54
mmHg ± 16, controls: 51 mmHg ± 19, p = 0.165), or average
contraction surface (cases: 1875 mmHg*s ± 555, controls:
1798 ± 600, p = 0.26). Similar results were reported for the
second stage.
Conclusions
Main finding
The evidence for a relationship between UA and adverse
infant outcomes is inconsistent. The reported effect sizes
vary from small and not statistically significant to highly
clinically significant.
Strengths and limitations
Individual studies
Only one study reported direct measures of neurological
function in neonates and no study reported long-term
neurological outcomes. These interactions are inherently
difficult to assess because adverse outcomes of these
types are rare and often require long-term follow-up.
As pre-specified in our protocol, NICU admission was
excluded as an outcome. Admission to the NICU was reported either as an individual or as part of a composite
outcome in three of the included studies .
The group of babies admitted to NICU is heterogenous
and likely significantly composed of babies conditions
not associated with neurological function.
One study explicitly excluded neonates with encephalopathy, potentially introducing significant selection bias.
Selection criteria for studies of intrapartum monitoring
should allow for the inclusion of labours with negative
outcomes including HIE and fetal death. The remaining
studies reported proxy outcomes used as measures of
intrapartum hypoxia-ischemia i.e. umbilical cord gas
values or Apgar scores. These measures indicate an increased risk of neurological injury but are acknowledged
to be decidedly non-specific predictors of long-term
outcome .
None of the included articles reported sample size
calculations. Since the relevant adverse outcomes are
rare and assuming modest estimated effect sizes, several
of the included studies were underpowered for the
variables of interest to this review.
When trying to establish a causative relationship, controlling for confounding variables through multivariate
analysis should be based on a model of the mechanisms
of the purported relationships between the exposure, the
outcome, and the potential confounder . Oxytocin
and nulliparity are both associated with increased UA
 . Therefore, in a study of UA and neonatal outcomes, it is not usually appropriate to control for these
factors since, according to the hypothesis, they may be
causally related to the outcome via their effect on uterine
activity. Some included studies e.g. Heuser et al. reported
multivariate analyses which included these variables.
Chorioamnionitis, oligohydramnios, pre-eclampsia and
the duration of labour have all been associated with both
increased UA and adverse neonatal outcomes . For the most part, the connection between these
factors and neonatal outcomes is not plausibly via their
effect on tachysystole. Therefore, it may be appropriate
to control for these factors when analysing the influence
of UA on neonatal outcomes. They were not considered
in the included studies.
Review level
The permissive eligibility criteria for this review allowed
a comprehensive survey of the literature. Due to the significant heterogeneity of the studies in terms of overall
design, as well as the types and definitions of exposures
and outcomes, metanalysis was precluded by this approach. However, given the disparate nature and small
size of the evidence base, valid metanalysis would not
have been possible even with a narrowly focused review.
The assessment of bias in the individual studies was
noninterventional studies are not robust .
Publication bias is common in systematic reviews and
may particularly affect observational studies . Since
publication bias is difficult to assess accurately and
owing to the heterogeneity of the included studies, no
formal assessment was attempted. Study registration and

publication bias and selective reporting in observational
studies . None of the included trials had protocols
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. No replication studies were
Interpretation
Most commonly UA was defined in terms of rate only,
as a dichotomous variable and without regard to labour
progress. This model is partly based on unavoidable
limitations of external tocography but is nonetheless a
reductive view of UA which may obscure the effect of
increased UA on neonatal outcomes.
The aim of this review was not to assess the impact of
UA levels on FHR patterns. However, it is important to
consider how interventions for FHR abnormalities might
affect the relationship between UA and neonatal outcomes. Three included studies reported increased rates
of FHR pattern abnormalities in labours with TS and another reported worsening of FHR traces to be temporally related to TS. In Bofill et al. labours with TS
were more likely to result in caesarean delivery for FHR
abnormalities. If increased UA leads to fetal distress, interventions for fetal distress such as caesarean delivery
might lessen the impact of increased UA and the observed effect on outcome could be weakened. Therefore,
differences in the management of TS and/or fetal distress are among the possible explanations for the disparity in reported results. Future studies should report on
delivery methods and their indications, as well as any
intrauterine resuscitation administered so that these
measures can be taken into account.
As an individual marker, it is unlikely that UA can accurately predict the condition of a fetus after delivery. It
is possible that increased UA is not on its own typically
sufficient to produce significant fetal hypoxia-ischemia
but that, in concert with other factors such as placental
insufficiency or prolonged labour, it may contribute to
adverse neonatal outcomes.
Based on current evidence, which is limited, tachysystole is common and mostly does not result in neonatal complications. There is inconsistent evidence to
support the hypothesis that increased UA is associated with neonatal markers of intrapartum hypoxiaischemia and depressed neurological function in the
