With nearly one billion online videos viewed everyday,
an emerging new frontier in computer vision research is
recognition and search in video.
While much effort has
been devoted to the collection and annotation of large scalable static image datasets containing thousands of image
categories, human action datasets lag far behind.
Current action recognition databases contain on the order of
ten different action categories collected under fairly controlled conditions. State-of-the-art performance on these
datasets is now near ceiling and thus there is a need for the
design and creation of new benchmarks. To address this issue we collected the largest action video database to-date
with 51 action categories, which in total contain around
7,000 manually annotated clips extracted from a variety of
sources ranging from digitized movies to YouTube. We use
this database to evaluate the performance of two representative computer vision systems for action recognition and
explore the robustness of these methods under various conditions such as camera motion, viewpoint, video quality and
occlusion.
1. Introduction
With several billion videos currently available on the internet and approximately 24 hours of video uploaded to
YouTube every minute, there is an immediate need for robust algorithms that can help organize, summarize and retrieve this massive amount of data.
While much effort
has been devoted to the collection of realistic internetscale static image databases , current action recognition datasets lag far behind. The most popular
benchmark datasets, such as KTH , Weizmann or the
IXMAS dataset , contain around 6-11 actions each. A
typical video clip in these datasets contains a single staged
actor with no occlusion and very limited clutter. As they
are also limited in terms of illumination and camera position variation, these databases are not quite representative
of the richness and complexity of real-world action videos.
Figure 1. Sample frames from the proposed HMDB51 (from
top left to lower right, actions are: hand-waving, drinking, sword
ﬁghting, diving, running and kicking). Some of the key challenges
are large variations in camera viewpoint and motion, the cluttered
background, and changes in the position, scale, and appearances
of the actors.
Recognition rates on these datasets tend to be very high.
A recent survey of action recognition systems reported
that 12 out of the 21 tested systems perform better than 90%
on the KTH dataset. For the Weizmann dataset, 14 of the 16
tested systems perform at 90% or better, 8 of the 16 better
than 95%, and 3 out of 16 scored a perfect 100% recognition rate. In this context, we describe an effort to advance
the ﬁeld with the design of a large video database containing 51 distinct action categories, dubbed the Human Motion DataBase (HMDB51), that tries to better capture the
richness and complexity of human actions (see Figure 1).
Related work.
An overview of existing datasets is shown
in Table 1. In this list, the Hollywood and UCF50 
datasets are two examples of recent efforts to build more realistic action recognition datasets by considering video clips
taken from real movies and YouTube. These datasets are
more challenging due to large variations in camera motion,
object appearance and changes in the position, scale and
viewpoint of the actors, as well as cluttered background.
The UCF50 dataset extends the 11 action categories from
the UCF YouTube dataset for a total of 50 action categories
with real-life videos taken from YouTube. Each category
has been further organized by 25 groups containing video
clips that share common features (e.g. background, camera
position, etc.).
The UCF50, its close cousin, the UCF Sports dataset
 , and the recently introduced Olympic Sports dataset
 , contain mostly sports videos from YouTube. As a result of searching for speciﬁc titles on YouTube, these types
of actions are usually unambiguous and highly distinguishable from shape cues alone (e.g., the raw positions of the
joints or the silhouette extracted from single frames).
To demonstrate this point, we conducted a simple experiment: using Amazon Mechanical Turk, 14 joint locations
were manually annotated at every frame for 5 randomly selected clips from each of the 9 action categories of the UCF
Sports dataset. Using a leave-one-clip-out procedure, classifying the features derived from the joint locations at single frames results in a recognition rate above 98% (chance
level 11%). This suggests that the information of static joint
locations alone is sufﬁcient for the recognition of those actions while the use of joint kinematics is not necessary. This
seems unlikely to be true for more real-world scenarios. It is
also incompatible with previous results of Johansson et al.
 , who demonstrated that joint kinematics play a critical
role for the recognition of biological motion.
We conducted a similar experiment on the proposed
HMDB51 where we picked 10 action categories similar to
those of the UCF50 (e.g. climb, climb-stairs, run, walk,
jump, etc.) and obtained manual annotations for the 14 joint
locations in a set of over 1,100 random clips. The classiﬁcation accuracy of features derived from the joint locations
at single frames now reaches only 35% (chance level 10%)
and is much lower than the 54% obtained using motion features from the entire clip (Section 4.1). We also computed
the classiﬁcation accuracy of the 10 action categories of the
UCF50 using the motion features and obtained an accuracy
These small experiments suggest that the proposed
HMDB51 is an action dataset whose action categories
mainly differ in motion rather than static poses and can thus
be seen as a valid contribution for the evaluation of action
recognition systems as well as for the study of relative contributions of motion vs. shape cues, a current topic in bio-

Contributions.
The proposed HMDB51 contains 51 distinct action categories, each containing at least 101 clips
for a total of 6,766 video clips extracted from a wide range
of sources. To the best of our knowledge, it is to-date the
largest and perhaps most realistic available dataset. Each
clip was validated by at least two human observers to ensure consistency. Additional meta information allows for
a precise selection of testing data, as well as training and
evaluation of recognition systems. The meta tags for each
clip include the camera view-point, the presence or absence
of camera motion, the video quality, and the number of actors involved in the action. This should permit the design
of more ﬂexible experiments to evaluate the performance
of computer vision systems using selected subsets of the
We use the proposed HMDB51 to evaluate the performance of two representative action recognition systems. We
consider the biologically-motivated action recognition system by Jhuang et al. , which is based on a model of the
dorsal stream of the visual cortex and was recently shown
to achieve on-par with humans for the recognition of rodent
behaviors in the homecage environment . We also consider the spatio-temporal bag-of-words system by Laptev
and colleagues .
We compare the performance of the two systems, evaluate their robustness to various sources of image degradations and discuss the relative role of shape vs. motion information for action recognition. We also study the inﬂuence
of various nuisances (camera motion, position, video quality, etc.) on the recognition performance of these systems
and suggest potential avenues for future research.
2. The Human Motion DataBase (HMDB51)
2.1. Database collection
In order to collect human actions that are representative
of everyday actions, we started by asking a group of students to watch videos from various internet sources and digitized movies and annotate any segment of these videos that

upper (30.5%)
camera motion (59.9%)
no motion (40.1%)
front (40.8%)
back (18.2%)
left (22.1%)
right (19.0%)
low (20.8%)
medium (62.1%)
good (17.1%)

represents a single non-ambiguous human action. Students
were asked to consider a minimum quality standard like a
single action per clip, a minimum of 60 pixels in height for
the main actor, minimum contrast level, minimum 1 second of clip length, and acceptable compression artifacts.
The following sources were used: digitized movies, public
databases such as the Prelinger archive, other videos available on the internet, and YouTube and Google videos. Thus,
a ﬁrst set of annotations was generated with over 60 action
categories. It was reduced to 51 categories by retaining only
those with at least 101 clips.
The actions categories can be grouped in ﬁve types:
1) General facial actions: smile, laugh, chew, talk; 2) Facial actions with object manipulation: smoke, eat, drink;
3) General body movements: cartwheel, clap hands, climb,
climb stairs, dive, fall on the ﬂoor, backhand ﬂip, handstand, jump, pull up, push up, run, sit down, sit up, somersault, stand up, turn, walk, wave; 4) Body movements
with object interaction: brush hair, catch, draw sword, dribble, golf, hit something, kick ball, pick, pour, push something, ride bike, ride horse, shoot ball, shoot bow, shoot
gun, swing baseball bat, sword exercise, throw; 5) Body
movements for human interaction: fencing, hug, kick someone, kiss, punch, shake hands, sword ﬁght.
2.2. Annotations
In addition to action category labels, each clip was annotated with meta information to allow for a more precise
evaluation of the limitation of current computer vision systems. The meta information contains the following ﬁelds:
visible body parts / occlusions indicating if the head, upper
body, lower body or the full body is visible, camera motion
indicating whether the camera is moving or static, camera
view point relative to the actor (labeled front, back, left or
right) , and the number of people involved in the action (one,
two or multiple people).
The clips were also annotated according to their video
quality. We consider three levels: 1) High – detailed visual
elements such as the ﬁngers and eyes of the main actor identiﬁable through most of the clip, limited motion blur and
limited compression artifacts; 2) Medium – large body parts
like the upper and lower arms and legs identiﬁable through
most of the clip; 3) Low – large body parts not identiﬁable
due in part to the presence of motion blur and compression
artifacts. The distribution of the meta tags for the entire
dataset is shown in Figure 2.
2.3. Training and testing set generation
For evaluation purposes, three distinct training and testing splits were generated from the database. The sets were
built to ensure that clips from the same video were not used
for both training and testing and that the relative proportions
of meta tags such as camera position, video quality, motion,
etc. were evenly distributed across the training and testing
sets. For each action category in our dataset we selected
sets of 70 training and 30 testing clips so that they fulﬁll the
70/30 balance for each meta tag with the added constraint
that clips in the training and testing set could not come from
the same video ﬁle.
To this end, we selected the three best results by the de-
ﬁned criteria from a very large number of randomly generated splits. To ensure that selected splits are not correlated
with each other, we implemented a greedy approach by ﬁrst
picking the split with the most balanced meta tag distribution and subsequently choosing the second and third split
which are least correlated with the previous splits. The correlation was measured by normalized Hamming distance.
Because of the hard constraint of not using clips from the
same source for training and testing, it is not always possible to ﬁnd an optimal split that has perfect meta tag distribution, but we found that in practice the simple approach
described above provides reasonable splits.
2.4. Video normalization
The original video sources used to extract the action clips
vary in size and frame rate. To ensure consistency across
the database, the height of all the frames was scaled to 240
pixels. Te width was scaled accordingly to maintain the
original aspect ratio. The frame rate was converted to 30
fps for all the clips. All the clips were compressed using the
DivX 5.0 codec with the ffmpeg video library.
2.5. Video stabilization
A major challenge accompanying the use of video clips
extracted from real-world videos is the potential presence
of signiﬁcant camera motion, which is the case for approximately 2/3 of the clips in our database as shown in Figure 2.
As camera motion is assumed to interfere with the local motion computation and should be corrected, it follows that
video stabilization is a key pre-processing step. To remove
the camera motion, we used standard image stitching techniques to align frames of a clip.
Figure 3. Examples of a clip stabilized over 50 frames showing
from the top to the bottom, the 1st, 30th and 50th frame of the
original (left column) and stabilized clip (right column).

To do this, a background plane is estimated by detecting
and matching salient features in two adjacent frames. Corresponding features are computed using a distance measure
that includes both the absolute pixel differences and the Euler distance of the detected points. Points with a minimum
distance are then matched and the RANSAC algorithm is
used to estimate the geometric transformation between all
neighboring frames. This is done independently for every
pair of frames.
Using this estimated transformation, all
frames of the clip are warped and combined to achieve a
stabilized clip. We visually inspected a large number of the
resulting stabilized clips and found that the image stitching techniques work surprisingly well. Figure 3 shows an
example. For the evaluation of the action recognition systems, the performance was reported for the original clips as
well as the stabilized clips.
3. Comparison with other action datasets
To compare the proposed HMDB51 with existing realworld action datasets such as Hollywood, Hollywood2,
UCF Sports, and the UCF YouTube dataset, we evaluate
the discriminative power of various low-level features. For
an ideal unbiased action dataset, low-level features such as
color should not be predictive of the high-level action category. For low-level features we considered the mean color
in the HSV color space computed for each frame over a
12 × 16 spatial grid as well as the combination of color and
gray value and the use of PCA to reduce the feature dimension of those descriptors. Here we report the results “color
+ gray + PCA”.
We further considered the low-level global scene information (gist) computed for three frames of a clip. Gist
is a coarse orientation-based representation of an image that
has been shown to capture well the contextual information
in a scene and shown to perform quite well on a variety of
recognition tasks, see . We used the source code provided by the authors.
Lastly, we compare these low-level cues with a common
mid-level spatio-temporal bag-of-words cue (HOG/HOF)
by computing spatial temporal interest points for all clips.
A standard bag of words approach with 2,000 , 3,000 , 4,000
, and 5,000 visual words was used for classiﬁcation and the
best result is reported. For evaluation we used the testing
and training splits that came with the datasets, otherwise a
3- or 5-fold cross validation was used for datasets without
speciﬁed splits. Table 2 shows the results sorted by the number of classes (N) in each dataset. Percent drop is computed
for the performance down from HOG/HOF features to each
of the two types of low-level features. A small percentage
drop means that the low-level features perform as well as
the mid-level motion features.
Results obtained by classifying these very simple features show that the UCF Sports dataset can be classiﬁed by
scene descriptors rather than by action descriptors as gist
is more predictive than mid-level spatio-temporal features.
We conjecture that gist features are predictive of the sports
actions (i.e., UCF Sports) because most sports are locationspeciﬁc. For example, ball games usually occur on grass
ﬁeld, swimming is always in water, and most skiing happens on snow. The results also reveal that low-level features
are fairly predictive as compared to mid-level features for
the UCF YouTube and UCF50 dataset. This might be due
to low-level biases for videos on YouTube, e.g., preferred
vantage points and camera positions for amateur directors.
For the dataset collected from general movies or Hollywood
movies, the performance of various low-level cues is on average lower than that of the mid-level spatio-temporal features. This implies that the datasets collected from YouTube
tend to be biased and capture only a small range of colors
and scenes across action categories compared to those collected from movies. The similar performance using lowlevel and mid-level features for the Hollywood dataset is
likely due to the low number of source movies (12). Clips
extracted from the same movie usually have similar scenes.
4. Benchmark systems
To evaluate the discriminability of our 51 action categories we focus on the class of algorithms for action recognition based on the extraction of local space-time information from videos, which have become the dominant trend in
the past ﬁve years . Various local space-time based approaches mainly differ in the type of detectors (e.g., the implementation of the spatio-temporal ﬁlters), the feature descriptors, and the number of spatio-temporal points sampled
(dense vs. sparse). Wang et al. have grouped these detectors
and descriptors into six types and evaluated their performance on the KTH, UCF Sports and Hollywood2 datasets
in a common experimental setup .
The results have shown that Laptev’s combination of a
histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) and histogram of oriented ﬂow (HOF) descriptors performed best for the Hollywood2 and UCF Sports. As HMDB51 contains movies
and YouTube videos, these datasets are considered the most
similar in terms of video sources. Therefore, we selected
the algorithm by Latptev and colleagues as one of our
benchmarks. To expand beyond , we chose for our second benchmark approaches developed by our group .
It uses a hierarchical architecture modeled after the ventral
and dorsal streams of the primate visual cortex for the task
of object and action recognition, respectively.
In the following we provide a detailed comparison between these algorithms, looking in particular at the robustness of the two approaches with respect to various nuisance
factors including the quality of the video and the camera
motion, as well as changes in the position, scale and viewpoint of the main actors.
4.1. HOG/HOF features
The combination of HOG, which has been used for the
recognition of objects and scenes, and HOF, a 3D ﬂowbased version of HOG, has been shown to achieve stateof-the-art performance on several commonly used action
datasets . We used the binaries provided by to
extract features using the Harris3D as feature detector and
the HOG/HOF feature descriptors. For every clip a set of
3D Harris corners is detected and a local descriptor is computed as a concatenation of the HOG and HOF around the
For classiﬁcation, we implemented a bag-of-words system as described in . To evaluate the best code book
size, we sampled 100,000 space-time interest-point descriptors from the training set and applied the k-means clustering
to obtain a set of k = visual
words. For every clip, each of the local point descriptors is
matched to the nearest prototype returned by k-means clustering and a global feature descriptor is obtained by computing a histogram over the index of the matched codebook entries. This results in a k-dimensional feature vector where k
is the number of visual words learned from k-means. These
clip descriptors are then used to train and test a support vector machine (SVM) in the classiﬁcation stage.
We used a SVM with an RBF kernel K(u, v)
exp(−γ ∗|u −v|2)). The parameters of the RBF kernel
(the cost term C and kernel bandwidth γ) were optimized
using a greedy search with a 5-fold cross-validation on the
training set.
The best result for the original clips was reached for
k = 8, 000 whereas the best result for the stabilized clips
was for at k = 2000 (see Section 5.1). To validate our reimplementation of Laptev’s system, we evaluated the performance of the system on the KTH dataset and were able
to reproduce the results for the HOG (81.4%) and HOF descriptors (90.7%) as reported in .
4.2. C2 features
Two types of C2 features have been described in the literature. One is from a model that was designed to mimic the
hierarchical organization and functions of the ventral stream
of the visual cortex . The ventral stream is believed to
be critically involved in the processing of shape information and the scale-and-position-invariant object recognition.
The model starts with a pyramid of Gabor ﬁlters (S1 units at
different orientations and scales), which correspond simple
cells in the primary visual cortex. The next layer (C1) models the complex cells in the primary visual cortex by pooling
together the activity of S1 units in a local spatial region and
across scales to build some tolerance to 2D transformations
(translation and size) of inputs.
The third layer (S2) responses are computed by matching
the C1 inputs with a dictionary of n prototypes learned from
a set of training images. As opposed to the bag-of-words
approach that uses vector quantization and summarizes the
indices of the matched codebook entries, we retain the similarity (ranging from 0 to 1) with each of the n prototypes.
In the top layer of the feature hierarchy, a n-dimensional
C2 vector is obtained for each image by pooling the maximum of S2 responses across scales and positions for each
of the n prototypes. The C2 features have been shown to
perform comparably to state-of-the-art algorithms applied
to the problem of object recognition . They have also
been shown to account well for the properties of cells in
the inferotemporal cortex (IT), which is the highest purely
visual area in the primate brain.
Based on the work described above, Jhuang et al. 
proposed a model of the dorsal stream of the visual cortex. The dorsal stream is thought to be critically involved
in the processing of motion information and the perception
of motion. The model starts with spatio-temporal Gabor
ﬁlters that mimic the direction-sensitive simple cells in the
primary visual cortex.
The dorsal stream model is a 3D (space-time) extension
of the ventral stream model. The S1 units in the ventral
stream model respond best to orientation in space, whereas
S1 units in the dorsal stream model have non-separable
spatio-temporal receptive ﬁelds and respond best to directions of motion, which could be seen as orientation in spacetime. It has been suggested that motion-direction sensitive
cells and shape-orientation cells perform the initial ﬁltering
for two parallel channels of feature processing, one for motion in the dorsal stream, and another for shape in the ventral
Beyond the S1 layer, the dorsal steam model follows the
same architecture as the ventral stream model. It contains
the C1, S2, C2 layers, which perform similar operations as
its ventral stream counterpart. The S2 units in the dorsal
stream model are now tuned to optic-ﬂow patterns that correspond to combinations of directions of motion whereas
the ventral S2 units are tuned to shape patterns corresponding to combinations of orientations. It has been suggested
that both the shape features processed in the ventral stream
and the motion features processed in the dorsal stream contribute to the recognition of actions. In this work, we consider their combination by computing both types of C2 features independently and then concatenating them.
5. Evaluation
5.1. Overall recognition performance
We ﬁrst evaluated the overall performance of both systems on the proposed HMDB51 averaged over three splits
(see Section 2.3). Both systems exhibited comparable levels
of performance slightly over 20% (chance level 2%). The
confusion matrix for both systems on the original clips is
shown in Figure 4. Errors seem to be randomly distributed
across category labels with no apparent trends. The most
surprising result is that the performance of the two systems
improved only marginally after stabilization for camera motion (Table 3).
As recognition results for both systems appear relatively low compared to previously published results on other
datasets , we conducted a simple experiment to
ﬁnd out whether this decrease in performance simply results from an increase in the number of object categories
and a corresponding decrease in chance level recognition or
an actual increase in the complexity of the dataset due for
instance to the presence of complex background clutter and
more intra-class variations. We selected 10 common actions in the HMDB51 that were similar to action categories
in the UCF50 and compared the recognition performance
of the HOG/HOF on video clips from the two datasets.
The following is a list of matched categories: basketball /

as walking with dog / walk.
Overall, we found a mild drop in performance from the
UCF50 with 66.3% accuracy down to 54.3% for similar categories on the HMDB51 (chance level 10% for both sets).
These results are also comparable to the performance of the
same HOG/HOF system on similar sized datasets of different actions with 51.7% over 12 categories of the Hollywood2 dataset and 58.9% over 11 categories of the UCF
YouTube dataset as shown in Table 2. These results suggest
that the relatively low performance of the benchmarks on
the proposed HMDB51 is most likely the consequence of
the increase in the number of action categories compared to
older datasets.

5.2. Robustness of the benchmarks
In order to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses
of the two benchmark systems on the HMDB51 in the
context of various nuisance factors, we broke down their
performance in terms of 1) visible body parts or equivalently the presence/absence of occlusions, 2) the presence/absence of camera motion, 3) viewpoint/ camera position, and 4) the quality of the video clips. We found that
the presence/absence of occlusions and the camera position
did not seem to inﬂuence performance. A major factor for
the performance of the two systems was the clip quality.
As shown on Table 4, from high to low quality videos, the
two systems registered a drop in performance of about 10%
(from 27.90%/28.62% for the HOG+HOF/C2 features for
the high quality clips down to 17.18%/17.54% for the low
quality clips).
A factor that affected the two systems differently was
camera motion: Whereas the HOG/HOF performance was
stable with the presence or absence of camera motion, surprisingly, the performance of the C2 features actually improved with the presence of camera motion. We suspect
that camera motion might actually increase the response of
the low-level S1 motion detectors. An alternative explanation is that the camera motion by itself might be correlated
with the action category. To evaluate whether camera motion alone can be predictive of the action category, we tried
to classify the mean parameters of the estimated frame-byframe motion returned by the video stabilization algorithm.
The result of 5.29% recognition shows that at least camera motion alone does not provide signiﬁcant information
in this case.
To further investigate how various nuisance factors may
affect the recognition performance of the two systems, we
conducted a logistic regression analysis to predict whether
each of the two systems will be correct vs. incorrect for speciﬁc conditions. The logistic regression model was built as
follows: the correctness of the predicted label was used as
binary dependent variable, the camera viewpoints were split
into one group for front and back views (because of similar appearances; front, back =0) and another group for side
views (left, right =1). The occlusion condition was split
into full body view (=0) and occluded views (head, upper
or lower body only =1). The video quality label was con-

verted into binary variables whereas the labels 10, 01 and
00 corresponded to a high, medium, and low quality video
respectively.
The estimated β coefﬁcients for the two systems are
shown in Table 5. The largest factor inﬂuencing performance for both systems remained the quality of the video
clips. On average the systems were predicted to be nearly
twice as likely to be correct on high vs. medium quality
videos. This is the strongest inﬂuence factor by far. However the regression analysis also conﬁrmed the assumption
that camera motion improves classiﬁcation performance.
Consistent with the previous analysis based on error rates,
this trend is only signiﬁcant for the C2 features. The additional factors, occlusion and camera viewpoint, did not have
a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the results of the HOG/HOF or C2
5.3. Shape vs. motion information
The role of shape vs. motion cues for the recognition of
biological motion has been the subject of an intense debate.
Computer vision could provide critical insight to this question as various approaches have been proposed that rely not
just on motion cues like the two systems we have tested but
also on single-frame shape-based cues, such as posture 
and shape , and contextual information .
We here study the relative contributions of shape vs. motion cues for the recognition of actions on the HMDB51.
We compared the HOG/HOF descriptor with the recognition of a shape-only HOG descriptor and a motion-only
HOF descriptor. We also compared the performance of the
previously mentioned motion-based C2 to those of shapebased C2. Table 6 shows the performance of the various
descriptors.
In general we ﬁnd that shape cues alone perform much
worse than motion cues alone, and their combination tends
to improve recognition performance very moderately. This
combination seems to affect the recognition of the original
clips rather than the recognition of the stabilized clips. An

earlier study suggested that “local shape and ﬂow for
a single frame is enough to recognize actions”. Our results
suggest that the statement might be true for simple actions
as is the case for the KTH dataset but motion cues do seem
to be more powerful than shape cues for the recognition of
complex actions like the ones in the HMDB51.
6. Conclusion
We described an effort to advance the ﬁeld of action
recognition with the design of what is, to our knowledge,
currently the largest action dataset.
With 51 action categories and just under 7,000 video clips, the proposed
HMDB51 is still far from capturing the richness and the full
complexity of video clips commonly found in the movies or
online videos. However given the level of performance of
representative state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms
with accuracy about 23%, this dataset is arguably a good
place to start (performance on the CalTech-101 database
for object recognition started around 16% ). Furthermore our exhaustive evaluation of two state-of-the-art systems suggest that performance is not signiﬁcantly affected
over a range of factors such as camera position and motion
as well as occlusions. This suggests that current methods
are fairly robust with respect to these low-level video degradations but remain limited in their representative power in
order to capture the complexity of human actions.
