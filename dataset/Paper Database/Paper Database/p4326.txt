Using the Deep Potential methodology, we construct a model that reproduces accurately the
potential energy surface of the SCAN approximation of density functional theory for water, from
low temperature and pressure to about 2400 K and 50 GPa, excluding the vapor stability region.
The computational eﬃciency of the model makes it possible to predict its phase diagram using
molecular dynamics. Satisfactory overall agreement with experimental results is obtained. The ﬂuid
phases, molecular and ionic, and all the stable ice polymorphs, ordered and disordered, are predicted
correctly, with the exception of ice III and XV that are stable in experiments, but metastable in
the model. The evolution of the atomic dynamics upon heating, as ice VII transforms ﬁrst into
ice VII′′ and then into an ionic ﬂuid, reveals that molecular dissociation and breaking of the ice
rules coexist with strong covalent ﬂuctuations, explaining why only partial ionization was inferred
in experiments.
The phase diagram of water is extremely rich. In the
temperature and pressure domain with T ⪅400 K and
P ⪅50 GPa, there are ten stable phases, nine solid (ice
Ih, II, III, V, VI, VII, VIII, XI and XV) and one liquid,
in addition to ﬁve metastable phases (ice IV, IX, XII,
XIII and XIV) . This large variety of structures are
made possible by hydrogen bonded arrangements of the
molecules. In ice, the oxygen sublattice is crystalline, but
the hydrogen sublattice can be either ordered or disordered, due to the vast number of nearly degenerate hydrogen (proton) conﬁgurations allowed by the ice rules. The
corresponding conﬁgurational or residual entropy stabilizes disordered polymorphs at high temperature. Thus,
near melting, all the stable phases are disordered (ice Ih,
III, V, VI, and VII). In ice Ih, VI, and VII, disorder is
complete and the residual entropy is well approximated
by kB ln 1.5 ≈0.4055kB/H2O . In ice III and V, disorder is partial and the entropy is less than Pauling’s estimate but still signiﬁcant . Upon cooling, ice
Ih, VI, and VII become less stable than their ordered
counterparts, ice XI , XV , and VIII , respectively. Ordered polymorphs are ferroelectric (XI) or antiferroelectric (II, XV, and VIII). Interestingly, ice II does
not have a disordered counterpart. See, e.g., Ref. for
a review of ice polymorphism.
At high pressure, the stability of the solid phases
extends to higher temperatures, the hydrogen bonds
weaken, and molecular dissociation into ions is promoted
by the increasing thermal ﬂuctuation. Molecular to ionic
transformation is continuous in the ﬂuid. In the solid,
for T ⪆850 K and pressures above ≈14 GPa, ice VII
transforms into ice VII′′, a superionic phase in which the
BCC oxygen sublattice of ice VII coexists with mobile
protons. Upon further heating, ice VII′′ melts into an
ionic ﬂuid .
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations give microscopic insight into the water phases and complement experiments with atomistic details .
The key ingredient of MD is the potential energy surface (PES),
which can be constructed either by ﬁtting a physically
motivated force ﬁeld to experiment, or, non-empirically,
from quantum theory (ab initio MD (AIMD)). Comparing the phase diagram predicted by MD to experiment is
the ultimate accuracy test of a model PES. Due to the
high computational cost of AIMD, extensive studies of
the water phase diagram have only been possible so far
with empirical force ﬁelds, which, however, face severe
diﬃculties with the ionic phases. By contrast, in AIMD,
the PES is constructed on-the-ﬂy from density functional
theory (DFT) and can describe molecular dissociation
processes. Indeed, this approach has been particularly
useful in modeling proton transfer in the liquid at ambient conditions , or the superionic ice phases at
high pressure and temperature .
Advances in machine learning (ML) are making possible MD simulations of ab initio quality at a cost of empirical force ﬁelds. Applications to water studied the phase
behavior at ambient and deeply undercooled 
conditions, isotopic eﬀects , infrared and Raman spectra , etc. A recent calculation reported
the phase diagram in the (T, P) range from 150 K to
300 K and from 0.01 GPa to 1 GPa, at the hybrid DFT
level, including nuclear quantum eﬀects . However, to
the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to
describe water in a wide thermodynamic range including
ordered and disordered ice, superionic ice, molecular and
ionic ﬂuid phases.
Here this goal is achieved with Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics (DPMD) , using an iterative concurrent learning scheme, Deep Potential (DP) Generator , to construct the PES with SCAN-DFT as
the reference. SCAN is a non-empirical functional
that describes well several properties of water . We
ﬁnd that a unique DP model can reproduce closely DFT
in a vast thermodynamic range, extending from ambient
pressure to ≈50 GPa and from ≈50 K to ≈2000 K,
excluding the vapor stability region. DPMD predicts the
stable phases, including ordered, disordered, and superionic ices, as well as molecular and ionic ﬂuid phases.
Overall, the phase diagram agrees well with experiment,
further validating the quality of the SCAN approximation. In the high (T, P) region the simulations reveal key
features of the temperature induced transitions from ice
VII to ice VII′′ and from the latter to an ionic ﬂuid.
To construct the model PES, a trial DP is built from
conﬁgurations of the liquid, at ambient conditions, and
of all the experimentally known stable and metastable
ice polymorphs for P ⪅50 GPa (Ih, Ic, II, III, IV, V, VI,
VII, VIII, IX, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV). The model is used
by DP Generator to explore a wide region of the phase
space with isothermal-isobaric (NPT ) DPMD trajectories. The protocol is iterated to reﬁne the model with
new DFT data until satisfactory accuracy is achieved.
The visited states can be roughly classiﬁed into three
groups: the low pressure (A), the high pressure (B), and
the superionic group (C). Group (A) includes states in
the range 50 ≤T ≤600 K and 10−4 ≤P ≤5 GPa,
starting from conﬁgurations of the ﬂuid and of all the
ices except VII and VIII. Group (B) includes states in
the range 50 ≤T ≤600 K and 0.1 ≤P ≤50 GPa,
starting from conﬁgurations of ice VII and VIII. Group
(C) includes states in the range 200 ≤T ≤2400 K and
1 ≤P ≤50 GPa, starting from ice VII and the ﬂuid.
DPMD samples almost uniformly the thermodynamic domains of the three groups. The deviation in the predicted
forces within a set of representative DP models is used to
label conﬁgurations for which new DFT calculations of
the energy, forces, and virial are necessary. The new data
are added to the training dataset and serve to reﬁne the
representative DP models entering the next iteration.
After 36 concurrent learning iterations the error in the
force is satisfactorily reduced and the procedure ends.
The accumulated number of snapshots in the training
dataset is 31058, a tiny fraction (∼0.05%) of the con-
ﬁgurations visited by DPMD. At this point, the relative energies of conﬁgurations within each phase are well
described, but deviations from DFT still aﬀect the averages. To reduce these deviations below a small threshold,
3519 additional training conﬁgurations are necessary 
(Supplementary Material (SM) Fig. S1).
The Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) version 5.4.4 is used for the DFT calculations.
DeePMD-kit is used for DP training and for running
DPMD, interfaced with LAMMPS . DP-GEN is
used for the concurrent learning process. See details in
Accuracy of the DP model. The error relative to DFT is
quantiﬁed with an independent testing dataset including
5141 conﬁgurations along 67 isothermal-isobaric DPMD
trajectories spanning the relevant thermodynamic domain (SM Fig. S2). In most cases, the root mean square
error (RMSE) of energy and force is ∼1meV/H2O and
∼50meV/˚A, respectively. Larger absolute errors may be
possible at high temperature, but since thermal ﬂuctuations are large, the relative RMSE is still of ∼10% or
Phase diagram. Thermodynamic integration is used to
compute the absolute Gibbs free energy of a single state
point of each phase . The algorithm of Ref. 
is used to generate the fully disordered structures of ice
Ih, IV, VI, and VII, and Pauling’s residual entropy contribution (0.4055kB/H2O) is added to their free energy.
For the partially disordered structures of ice III and V
and the corresponding entropies we follow Ref. . To
minimize ﬁnite size eﬀects we use cells with at least 128
molecules. Taking into account ﬁnite size, entropy approximation, DP error, and statistical uncertainty we estimate that the free energy error should be approximately
1 meV/H2O.
Then, using thermodynamic integration
with the composite Simpson rule we trace a family of
curves representing the variation with pressure along an
isotherm, or with temperature along an isobar, of the
free energy of each phase.
The intersections between
pairs of curves deﬁne phase coexistence points. Finally,
the phase boundary lines stemming from the coexistence
points are traced by integrating the Gibbs-Duhem equation with a second order Runge-Kutta method. See
SM, Sec. SIII A.
The numerical accuracy of the predicted phase boundaries can be gauged from the consistency of the predicted
triple points (TPs). Each TP can be inferred in three
independent ways from the intersection of two boundary

lines between the three coexisting phases. The average of
these estimates deﬁnes a TP, and the standard deviation
gives the estimated error. From the TPs in SM Tab. SV,
we infer that the numerical uncertainty of the calculated
phase boundaries is less than 5 K in temperature and less
than 0.02 GPa in pressure.
Overall, the DP phase diagram in Fig. 1 (a) agrees well
with experiment. All the stable ice phases are predicted
correctly, with two exceptions, ice III and XV, which are
metastable in the DP model. The Ih-F coexistence line
is displaced by ≈40 K to higher temperature than experiment, while the Ih-II line is displaced by ≈0.02 GPa
to higher pressure than experiment.
Thus, the stability of Ih is overestimated, consistent with the tendency
of the SCAN approximation to overestimate the hydrogen bond strength . On the other hand, the Ih-XI
boundary is predicted correctly, reﬂecting the close similarity of the hydrogen bond conﬁgurations in the two
systems. The shift to higher pressure of the Ih-II boundary may contribute to the metastability of ice III. The
metastability of ice XV may reﬂect a general diﬃculty
of gradient corrected functionals to predict the ground
state structure of this ice form .
Within the accuracy of the DP model, competing phases diﬀering in free
energy by ⪅1 meV/H2O should be considered degenerate. This happens to IV and VI in part of the stability
domain of the latter (SM Sec.SIII B). The coexistence
lines for P ⪆1 GPa including the ice-ﬂuid boundary, the
VII-VII′′ boundary, and the VII-VII′′-F TP are also in
good qualitative agreement with experiment. At pressures higher than reported in Fig. 1, ice VII transforms
into ice X .
This regime is beyond the domain of
validity of the present DP model and is not investigated.
It is instructive to compare the DP phase diagram with
the one derived from one of the most accurate empirical
water models, TIP4P/2005
 , which assumes rigid
molecules and is parameterized with experimental observations, such as, e.g., the temperature of maximal liquid density at ambient pressure, the densities of ice II,
III, and V at diﬀerent thermodynamic conditions, etc.
As shown in Fig. 1 (b), TIP4P/2005 works well at low
and intermediate pressures. At higher pressures, however, signiﬁcant deviations from experiment aﬀect the
boundary lines between ice VIII, VII, and VI. Moreover,
the rigid molecule approximation does not allow ionized
water conﬁgurations. At high pressure and temperature
TIP4P/2005 predicts a ﬁrst-order transition from ice VII
to a plastic phase, in which the BCC oxygen sublattice
coexists with freely rotating molecules . No experimental evidence has been found so far for this phase,
nor was such behavior observed in our DP simulations.
Ionic phases.
According to the DP model, at low
T , ice VII is a molecular crystal with full proton disorder and insigniﬁcant atomic diﬀusion. Upon heating,
however, H diﬀusion grows exponentially with T , while
O diﬀusion remains insigniﬁcant. This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 2(a) for the isobar at 30 GPa. Eventually H
diﬀusion saturates and remains approximately constant
over a ﬁnite T interval. At even higher T the diﬀusivities
of H and O jump to distinct macroscopic values signaling
transformation to a ﬂuid. Ice VII has been referred to as
ice VII′ and as ice VII′′ in the thermodynamic domains
of exponential growth and saturation of the H diﬀusivity . The enthalpy evolution along the 30 GPa isobar
is depicted in Fig. 2(b). It shows a smooth reversible variation in ice VII′ followed by a more rapid change when
ice VII′ turns into ice VII′′. This aﬀects enthalpy and
volume, and occurs spontaneously without apparent hysteresis over timescales of 100 ps in simulations with 438
molecules. Simulations with up to 3456 molecules show a
sharpening of the rapid change (SM Fig. S5), as expected
of a weakly ﬁrst-order phase transition. Since we cannot
associate a separate thermodynamic phase to ice VII′, we
retain for it the name of ice VII hereafter and in the phase
diagram. The VII-VII′′ transition shows the typical behavior of a type II superionic transition . A jump
in O diﬀusivity signals melting of ice VII′′, a transition
undetectable by monitoring the enthalpy on timescales
of 100 ps in a heat-until-melt simulation. Thus, to determine the melting temperature we used a two-phase simulation of 1728 molecules at 50 GPa, and extrapolated
the melting temperature to lower T with Gibbs-Duhem

integration. The predicted VII-VII′′-F TP is located at
(774 K 10.6 GPa), in relatively good agreement with the
most recent experimental result (850 K 14.6 GPa) .
Importantly, the same experiment conﬁrmed the ﬁrstorder nature of the VII-VII′′ transition, signaled by a
discontinuous change of the lattice parameter in X-ray
diﬀraction (XRD).
A magniﬁed view of the DP phase diagram in the VII-
VII′′-F domain is shown in Fig. 3, together with experimental and AIMD results. Overall there is good qualitative agreement: experiments conﬁrm the presence of
two ﬁrst-order transitions, a solid-solid and a solid-ﬂuid
one. Possibly, the signiﬁcant scatter in the experimental
data reﬂects the diﬃculty of detecting weakly ﬁrst-order
phase transitions at challenging thermodynamic conditions.
A two-step melting process for ice VII, with a
superionic intermediate, was ﬁrst proposed in Ref. 
based on AIMD simulations. The corresponding solidsolid phase transition was conﬁrmed experimentally in
Ref. , without structural details on the new solid
These were provided recently by XRD experiments that veriﬁed the BCC lattice structure of VII′′ .
The DP results are in semi-quantitative agreement with
AIMD simulations for the VII-VII′′ and VII′′-F boundaries . The diﬀerences between DPMD and
these earlier studies should be attributed mainly to the
adopted exchange-correlation functionals and to the relatively small size and time scales of the AIMD simulations.
DP simulations give insight on the atomistic processes
that underlie the two-step transition from ice VII to ionic
ﬂuid. The O-O, O-H, and H-H pair correlation functions
along the 30 GPa isobar shown in SM Fig. S4 illustrate
the progressive loss of long-range order as the system
progresses through ice VII, VII′′ and ionic ﬂuid. Interestingly, in spite of the large diﬀusivity of H in ice VII′′

and of H and O in the ﬂuid, the running O-H coordination
number retains a well deﬁned shoulder at a value equal
to 2, indicating that strong covalent ﬂuctuations favoring neutral water molecules remain eﬀective in presence
of ionization and breaking of the ice rules. The O sublattice is BCC in ice VII and VII′′. Thus, in ice VII, before
the onset of H diﬀusion each O has 8 O nearest neighbors
along the half-diagonals of a cube, 4 of which are occupied by an H atom satisfying the ice rules and 4 of which
are empty. Upon heating, ice rule breaking ﬂuctuations
occur, in which the H atoms oscillate along a bond creating OH−-OH+
3 defect pairs that either rapidly recombine or dissociate as the defects move further apart via
Grotthuss-like mechanisms . A rapid increase of the
proton mobility with T follows defect pairs dissociation.
This process is accompanied by partial occupation of the
empty O-O bonds due to molecular rotations, which occur along speciﬁc directions and are far from the free
rotations hypothesized for the plastic phase. As a consequence, the H population of the empty bond network
increases, that of the occupied bond network decreases,
and the overall H diﬀusion increases.
The occupation
of interstitial sites outside the bonds remains negligible
throughout. This trend continues until all the O-O bonds
are equally occupied and ice VII transforms to ice VII′′,
a process marked by a saturation of the H diﬀusivity and
a concomitant volume expansion due to diminished hydrogen bonding forces. Proton diﬀusion is associated to
rapid hops along the bonds with Grotthuss like mechanisms not only in ice VII′′ but also in the ionic ﬂuid. The
average population of ionic defects at 30 GPa is approximately 7.0 percent at 1250 K in ice VII′′, and becomes
10.8 percent at 1450 K in the ﬂuid. Thus, full ionization
is never achieved at these pressures, in agreement with
experiment .
In conclusion, we have shown that DP has made it
possible to predict the phase diagram of water from ab
initio quantum theory, over a vast range of temperatures
and pressures. With further training the potential constructed here could be extended to other thermodynamic
conditions, including the vapor and phases at higher temperatures and pressures. Extensions to model solutions
and interfacial water are also possible. Competing stable and metastable phases may have free energies within 1 meV/H2O or less, posing a severe challenge
both to the accuracy required from the reference quantum model, and to the faithfulness of its neural network
representation. Here we adopted the SCAN approximation of DFT in view of its good balance of eﬃciency and
accuracy, but more accurate functional approximations
and/or higher level quantum chemical methods would be
possible, in principle. Finally, the present study was entirely based on classical MD simulations, but it is known
that nuclear quantum eﬀects are responsible for the observed isotopic shifts in the thermodynamic properties
These shifts are typically smaller than the
deviations from experiment of the present classical formulation.
In future studies one can include these effects using path integral MD methods, as done, e.g., in
