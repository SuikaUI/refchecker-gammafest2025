This volume contains a selection of papers presented at the 7th symposium on
differential geometry and differential equations (=DD7),
which took place at Nankai
Institute of Mathematics, Tianjin, China, June 23
July 5, 1986. The subject was
partial differential equations. It was a culmination of a year-long
1985-1986 at the institute. A list of the other papers presented at the symposium
can be found at the end of this volume, some of which will be published elsewhere.
For the record I would like to give a list of the preceding DD-Symposia as follows:
