To Benjamin, Joachim, Rachel and Sarah, our favorite random generators!
Preface to the Second Edition
'What do you plan to do next?' de Wetherset asked, picking up a piece of
vellum covered with minute writing and studying it. Bartholomew rose to
leave. The Chancellor clearly was not interested in how they went about
getting the information, only in what they discovered.
-Susanna Gregory, An Unholy Alliance
It is a tribute to our profession that a textbook that was current in 1999 is
starting to feel old. The work for the first edition of Monte Carlo Statistical
Methods (MCSM1) was finished in late 1998, and the advances made since
then, as well as our level of understanding of Monte Carlo methods, have
grown a great deal. Moreover, two other things have happened. Topics that
just made it into MCSM1 with the briefest treatment (for example, perfect
sampling) have now attained a level of importance that necessitates a much
more thorough treatment. Secondly, some other methods have not withstood
the test of time or, perhaps, have not yet been fully developed, and now receive
a more appropriate treatment.
When we worked on MCSM1 in the mid-to-late 90s, MCMC algorithms
were already heavily used, and the flow of publications on this topic was at
such a high level that the picture was not only rapidly changing, but also
necessarily incomplete. Thus, the process that we followed in MCSM1 was
that of someone who was thrown into the ocean and was trying to grab onto
the biggest and most seemingly useful objects while trying to separate the
flotsam from the jetsam. Nonetheless, we also felt that the fundamentals of
many of these algorithms were clear enough to be covered at the textbook
level, so we swam on.
In this revision, written five years later, we have the luxury of a more
relaxed perspective on the topic, given that the flurry of activity in this area
has slowed somewhat into a steady state. This is not to say that there is no
longer any research in this area, but simply that the tree of publications, which
was growing in every direction in 1998, can now be pruned, with emphasis
Preface to the Second Edition
being put on the major branches. For this new edition, we thus spent a good bit
of time attempting to arrange the material (especially in the first ten chapters)
to be presented in a coherent, flowing story, with emphasis on fundamental
principles. In doing so the "Fundamental Theorem of Simulation" emerged,
which we now see as a basis for many Monte Carlo algorithms (as developed
in Chapters 3 and 8).
As a consequence of this coming-of-age of MCMC methods, some of the
original parts of MCSM1 have therefore been expanded, and others shrunken.
For example, reversible jump, sequential MC methods, two-stage Gibbs and
perfect sampling now have their own chapters. Also, we now put less emphasis
on some of the finer details of convergence theory, because of the simultaneous publication of Roberts and Tweedie , which covers the theory of
MCMC, with a comprehensive treatment of convergence results, and in general provides a deeper entry to the theory of MCMC algorithms.
We also spend less time on convergence control, because some of the methods presented in MCSM1 did not stand the test of time. The methods we
preserved in Chapter 12 have been sufficiently tested to be considered reliable. Finally, we no longer have a separate chapter on missing (or latent)
variables. While these models are usually a case study ideal for assessing simulation methods, they do not enjoy enough of a unified structure to be kept
as a separate chapter. Instead, we dispatched most of the remaining models
to different chapters of this edition.
From a (more) pedagogical point of view, we revised the book towards more
accessibility and readability, thus removing the most theoretical examples and
discussions. We also broke up the previously long chapters on Monte Carlo
integration and Gibbs sampling into more readable chapters, with increasing
coverage and difficulty. For instance, Gibbs sampling is first introduced via
the slice sampler, which is simpler to describe and analyze, then the twostage Gibbs sampler (or Data Augmentation) is presented on its own and
only then do we launch into processing the general Gibbs sampler. Similarly,
the experience of the previous edition led us to remove several problems or
examples in every chapter, to include more detailed examples and fundamental
problems, and to improve the help level on others.
Throughout the preparation of this book, and of its predecessors, we
were fortunate to have colleagues who provided help. George Fishman, Anne
Philippe, Judith Rousseau, as well as numerous readers, pointed out typos
and mistakes in the previous version, We especially grateful to Christophe Andrieu, Roberto Casarin, Nicolas Chopin, Arnaud Doucet, Jim Hobert, Merrilee
Hurn, Jean-Michel Marin, and Jesper M0ller, Fran<;ois Perron, Arafat Tayeb,
and an anonymous referee, for detailed reading of parts (or the whole) of the
manuscript of this second version. Obviously, we, rather than they, should
be held responsible for any imperfection remaining in the current edition! We
also gained very helpful feedback from the audiences of our lectures on MCMC
methods, especially during the summer schools of Luminy (France) in 2001

and 2002; Les Diablerets (Switzerland) and Venezia (Italy) in 2003; Orlando
in 2002 and 2003; Atlanta in 2003; and Oulanka (Finland) in 2004.
Thanks to Elias Moreno for providing a retreat in Granada for the launching of this project in November 2002 (almost) from the top of Mulhacen; to
Manuella Delbois who made the move to BibTeX possible by translating the
entire reference list of MCMCl into BibTeX format; to Jeff Gill for his patient
answers to our R questions, and to Olivier Cappe for never-ending Linux and
D.'IEX support, besides his more statistical (but equally helpful!) comments
and suggestions.

Preface to the First Edition
He sat, continuing to look down the nave, when suddenly the solution to
the problem just seemed to present itself. It was so simple, so obvious he
just started to laugh ...
-P.C. Doherty, Satan in St Mary's
Monte Carlo statistical methods, particularly those based on Markov chains,
have now matured to be part of the standard set of techniques used by statisticians. This book is intended to bring these techniques into the classroom,
being (we hope) a self-contained logical development of the subject, with
all concepts being explained in detail, and all theorems, etc. having detailed
proofs. There is also an abundance of examples and problems, relating the
concepts with statistical practice and enhancing primarily the application of
simulation techniques to statistical problems of various difficulties.
This is a textbook intended for a second-year graduate course. We do
not assume that the reader has any familiarity with Monte Carlo techniques
(such as random variable generation) or with any Markov chain theory. We do
assume that the reader has had a first course in statistical theory at the level
of Statistical Inference by Casella and Berger . Unfortunately, a few
times throughout the book a somewhat more advanced notion is needed. We
have kept these incidents to a minimum and have posted warnings when they
occur. While this is a book on simulation, whose actual implementation must
be processed through a computer, no requirement is made on programming
skills or computing abilities: algorithms are presented in a program-like format
but in plain text rather than in a specific programming language. (Most of
the examples in the book were actually implemented inC, with the S-Plus
graphical interface.)
Chapters 1-3 are introductory. Chapter 1 is a review of various statistical
methodologies and of corresponding computational problems. Chapters 2 and
3 contain the basics of random variable generation and Monte Carlo integration. Chapter 4, which is certainly the most theoretical in the book, is an
Preface to the First Edition
introduction to Markov chains, covering enough theory to allow the reader
to understand the workings and evaluate the performance of Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Section 4.1 is provided for the reader who
already is familiar with Markov chains, but needs a refresher, especially in the
application of Markov chain theory to Monte Carlo calculations. Chapter 5
covers optimization and provides the first application of Markov chains to simulation methods. Chapters 6 and 7 cover the heart of MCMC methodology,
the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the Gibbs sampler. Finally, Chapter 8 presents the state-of-the-art methods for monitoring convergence of the
MCMC methods and Chapter 9 shows how these methods apply to some statistical settings which cannot be processed otherwise, namely the missing data
Each chapter concludes with a section of notes that serve to enhance the
discussion in the chapters, describe alternate or more advanced methods, and
point the reader to further work that has been done, as well as to current
research trends in the area. The level and rigor of the notes are variable, with
some of the material being advanced.
The book can be used at several levels and can be presented in several ways.
For example, Chapters 1-3 and most of Chapter 5 cover standard simulation
theory, and hence serve as a basic introduction to this topic. Chapters 6-9 are
totally concerned with MCMC methodology. A one-semester course, assuming no familiarity with random variable generation or Markov chain theory
could be based on Chapters 1-7, with some illustrations from Chapters 8 and
9. For instance, after a quick introduction with examples from Chapter 1 or
Section 3.1, and a description of Accept-Reject techniques of Section 2.3, the
course could cover Monte Carlo integration (Section 3.2, Section 3.3 [except
Section 3.3.3], Section 3.4, Section 3.7), Markov chain theory through either
Section 4.1 or Section 4.2-Section 4.8 (while adapting the depth to the mathematical level of the audience), mention stochastic optimization via Section 5.3,
and describe Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs algorithms as in Chapters 6 and
7 (except Section 6.5, Section 7.1.5, and Section 7.2.4). Depending on the time
left, the course could conclude with some diagnostic methods of Chapter 8 (for
instance, those implemented in CODA) and/or some models of Chapter 9 (for
instance, the mixture models of Section 9.3 and Section 9.4). Alternatively,
a more advanced audience could cover Chapter 4 and Chapters 6-9 in one
semester and have a thorough introduction to MCMC theory and methods.
Much of the material in this book had its original incarnation as the French
monograph Methodes de Monte Carlo par Chaines de Markov by Christian
Robert , which has been tested for several years on
graduate audiences (in France, Quebec, and even Norway). Nonetheless, it
constitutes a major revision of the French text, with the inclusion of problems, notes, and the updating of current techniques, to keep up with the advances that took place in the past two years (like Langevin diffusions, perfect
sampling, and various types of monitoring).
Preface to the First Edition
Throughout the preparation of this book, and its predecessor, we were fortunate to have colleagues who provided help. Sometimes this was in the form
of conversations or references (thanks to Steve Brooks and Sid Chib!), and
a few people actually agreed to read through the manuscript. Our colleague
and friend, Costas Goutis, provided many helpful comments and criticisms,
mostly on the French version, but these are still felt in this version. We are
also grateful to Brad Carlin, Dan Fink, Jim Hobert, Galin Jones and Krishanu Maulik for detailed reading of parts of the manuscript, to our historian
Walter Piegorsch, and to Richard Tweedie, who taught from the manuscript
and provided many helpful suggestions, and to his students, Nicole Benton,
Sarah Streett, Sue Taylor, Sandy Thompson, and Alex Trindade. Richard,
whose influence on the field was considerable, both from a theoretical and a
methodological point of view, most sadly passed away last July. His spirit, his
humor and his brightness will remain with us for ever, as a recurrent process.
Christophe Andrieu, Virginie Brai'do, Jean-Jacques Colleau, Randall Douc,
Arnaud Doucet, George Fishman, Jean-Louis Foulley, Arthur Gretton, Ana
Justel, Anne Philippe, Sandrine Micaleff, and Judith Rousseau pointed out
typos and mistakes in either the French or the English versions (or both), but
should not be held responsible for those remaining! Part of Chapter 8 has a
lot in common with a "reviewww" written by Christian Robert with Chantal
Guihenneuc-Jouyaux and Kerrie Mengersen for the Valencia Bayesian meeting (and the Internet!). The input of the French working group "MC Cube,"
whose focus is on convergence diagnostics, can also be felt in several places of
this book. Wally Gilks and David Spiegelhalter granted us permission to use
their graph (Figure 2.5) and examples as Problems 10.29-10.36, for which we
are grateful. Agostino Nobile kindly provided the data on which Figures 10.4
and 10.4 are based. Finally, Arnoldo Frigessi (from Roma) made the daring
move of teaching (in English) from the French version in Oslo, Norway; not
only providing us with very helpful feedback but also contributing to making
Europe more of a reality!
