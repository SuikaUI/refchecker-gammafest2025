This draft: 2nd November 2003
This paper shows that realised power variation and its extension called realised bipower
variation that we introduce here is somewhat robust to rare jumps. We demonstrate that in
special cases realised bipower variation estimate integrated variance in stochastic volatility
models, thus providing a model free and consistent alternative to realised variance.
robustness property means that if we have a stochastic volatility plus infrequent jumps
process then the diﬀerence between realised variance and realised bipower variation estimates
the quadratic variation of the jump component. This seems to be the ﬁrst method which can
separate quadratic variation into its continuous and jump components. Various extensions
are given, together with proofs of special cases of these results. Detailed mathematical results
will be reported elsewhere.

Introduction
Motivation
The econometrics of ﬁnancial volatility has made very signiﬁcant recent progress due to the
harnessing of high frequency information through the use of realised variances. Here we discuss generalisations of objects of that type, studying sums of powers and products of powers
of absolute returns. We will show that these quantities, called realised power variation and
bipower variation, respectively, are both quite robust to rare jumps in the log-price process. In
particular we demonstrate that it is possible, in theory, to untangle the impact of the presence
of volatility and rare jumps by using power and bipower variation. Realised bipower variation
also provides a new asymptotically unbiased, model free econometric estimator of integrated
variance in stochastic volatility (SV) models. This estimator is robust to the presence of jumps.
Hence, in theory, we can now decompose quadratic variation into the contribution from the
continuous component of log-prices and the impact of jumps. Given that quadratic variation
plays a crucial role in the theory of measuring the risk associated with an asset, being able to
separate the diﬀusion and jump risks seems interesting. We believe ours is the ﬁrst paper to do
this without making strong parametric assumptions.
To start, let us establish some notation. Suppose that ℏ> 0 is some ﬁxed time period (e.g.
a trading day or a calendar month) and that the log-price of an asset is written as y∗(t) for
t ≥0. Then the i-th ℏ“low frequency” return is
yi = y∗(iℏ) −y∗((i −1) ℏ) ,
i = 1, 2, ... .
For concreteness we will often refer to the i-th period as the i-th day. Suppose, in addition to
yi, that we record the prices at M equally spaced time points during the i-th day. Then we can
deﬁne the “high frequency” returns as
yj,i = y∗¡
(i −1) ℏ+ ℏjM −1¢
(i −1) ℏ+ ℏ(j −1) M −1¢
j = 1, 2, ..., M.
Here yj,i is the j-th intra-ℏreturn for the i-th day (e.g. if M = 288, then this is the return for
the j-th 5 minute period on the i-th day). As a result, for example, yi = PM
To illustrate this notation we will look at the ﬁrst three days of the Olsen and Associates’
dollar/DM high frequency series. It starts on 1st December 1986 and ignores weekend breaks.
This series is constructed every ﬁve minutes by the Olsen group from bid and ask quotes which
appeared on the Reuters screen for
details). The log values of the raw data, having being preprocessed in a manner discussed in
the Appendix of Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard , are shown in the top left of Figure
1. We have shifted the data to start at zero at time zero. This series constitutes an empirical
counterpart, recorded every ﬁve minutes, to our y∗process. The top right part of the Figure
shows the ﬁrst three daily returns y1,i = yi, i.e. M = 1, calculated oﬀthis series. Hence in
this case i = 1, 2, ..., 3. These returns are shown as large squares. The bottom left part shows
yj,i, for j = 1, 2, ..., 8 and i = 1, 2, 3. These are 3 hour returns. Finally, the bottom right graph
shows the eﬀect of taking M = 48, which corresponds to 30 minute returns.
In this paper we begin by recalling the well known connections between realised variance
y*(t), with y*(0)=0
Returns yj,i M=1.
Returns yj,i M=8
Returns yj,i M=48

and quadratic variation1. This is also linked to its square root version2, the realised volatility
j,i. The paper then progresses to work with more general aggregate volatility measures.
These will initially be based on realised power variation
and, to a lesser extent, its unnormalised version3 [y∗
j=1 |yj,i|r. These quantities have
recently been formalised by Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard . A review of some of the
work on this topic is given in Barndorﬀ-Nielsen, Graversen, and Shephard . When r = 2
1Realised variances have been used for a long time in ﬁnancial economics — see, for example, Poterba and
Summers , Schwert and Dacorogna, M¨uller, Olsen, and Pictet . Realised variance has been
studied from a methodological viewpoint by, for example, Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold, and Labys ,
Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard and Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard . See Andersen, Bollerslev,
and Diebold for a survey of this area, including a discussion of the related literature.
2Note that in econometrics sums of squared returns are sometimes called realised volatility.
3The similarly named p-variation, 0 < p < ∞, of a real-valued function f on [a, b] is deﬁned as
|f(xi) −f(xi−1)|p ,
where the supremum is taken over all subdivisions κ of [a, b]. If this function is ﬁnite then f is said to have
bounded p-variation on [a, b]. The case of p = 1 gives the usual deﬁnition of bounded variation. This concept of
p-variation has been studied recently in the probability literature. See the work of Lyons , Mikosch and
Norvaiˇsa and Lyons and Qian .
this yields the traditional realised variance. When r = 1 we produce realised absolute variation4
j=1 |yj,i|.
The most important contribution of this paper is the introduction of a generalisation of the
above ideas. This is called realised bipower variation
¶1−(r+s)/2) M−1
|yj,i|r |yj+1,i|s ,
In particular, for example, we will show that in the r = s = 1 case
|yj,i| |yj+1,i|
will, up to a simple known multiple, converge to the same probability limit as realised variance
when prices follow a SV process and that for (3) the limit does not change with the addition of
rare jumps. This provides a new way of making inference and predicting integrated variance in
SV models, perhaps the single most important term in the econometrics of volatility. Further,
it gives a simple way of measuring the impact of jumps on quadratic variation.
Outline of the paper
In Section 2 of this paper we review the well known probability limit of realised variance, which
is built on the theory of semimartingales and the quadratic variation process. We specialise the
theory to a class of continuous sample path stochastic volatility semimartingales. For this class
it is possible to extend the quadratic variation process to the power variation process, which
allows us to derive the probability limit of realised power variation. Finally, we introduce the
idea of bipower variation and study some of its properties.
Having established the probability limit for the various realised variations, in Section 3 we
ﬁnd the probability limit of realised power variation in the case where we add a compound
Poisson process to the SV process.
We see that sometimes the limit is not changed by the
addition of jumps. We then extend this analysis to realised bipower variation and see that the
robustness result holds so long as the maximum of the powers is less than two. This result is
the main contribution of the paper.
4Andersen and Bollerslev and Andersen and Bollerslev empirically studied the properties of
sums of absolute values of intra-day returns on speculative assets.
This was empirically attractive, for using
absolute values is less sensitive to possible large movements in high frequency data.
However, the approach
was abandoned in their subsequent work reported in Andersen and Bollerslev and Andersen, Bollerslev,
Diebold, and Labys due to the lack of appropriate theory for the sum of absolute returns as M →∞,
although recently Andreou and Ghysels have performed some interesting Monte Carlo studies in this
context, while Shiryaev and Maheswaran and Sims mention interest in the limit of
sums of absolute returns.
In Section 4 we conduct a simulation study of a SV plus jump process, demonstrating that
the theory seems to yield useful predictions. In Section 5 we apply the theory to some empirical
data and in Section 6 we indicate various possible extensions of our work. Section 7 concludes.
Basic development and ideas
Realised variance and quadratic variation
The i-th realised variance is based on squares of high frequency observations in the interval
of time between ℏ(i −1) and ℏi. To understand the properties of realised variance we need
to connect it to the quadratic variation process — which we will deﬁne in a moment. It is
traditional, convenient and elegant to write the theory of quadratic variation based on the
interval from time 0 to t. We will follow that route here and continue with it when we initially
discuss its generalisations to power variation. We can then back out the implication for items
such as realised variance, which are based solely on quantities calculated on the interval from
ℏ(i −1) to ℏi.
These speciﬁc realised variance results will be presented at the end of this
subsection.
The probability limit of realised variance (1) is known under the assumption that y∗is a
semimartingale (SM), using the theory of quadratic variation ). Recall if y∗∈SM, then we can write
y∗= α∗+ m∗,
where α∗, a drift term, has locally ﬁnite variation paths (FVloc) and m∗is a local martingale
(Mloc). One of the most important aspects of semimartingales is the quadratic variation (QV)
process. This is deﬁned as
[y∗](t) = p−lim
{y∗(tj) −y∗(tj−1)}2,
for any sequence of partitions t0 = 0 < t1 < ... < tM = t so long as supj{tj −tj−1} →0 for
In general
[y∗c](t) + [y∗d](t)
[y∗c](t) +
{∆y∗(s)}2 ,
where y∗c is the continuous local martingale component of y∗, y∗d the corresponding jump
process and ∆y∗(t) = y∗(t) −y∗(t−) is the jump at time t. If α∗∈FVc
loc (i.e. the subset of the
FVloc class that has continuous sample paths) then we obtain the simpliﬁcation
[y∗](t) = [m∗](t) = [m∗c](t) +
{∆m∗(s)}2 .
It is somewhat instructive to think of the economics of semimartingales and quadratic variation in the following way. We start with y∗∈SM so that
dy∗= dα∗+ dm∗.
loc (and so predictable) and if m∗∈M (a martingale) then the predictability of α∗
means that
E (dy∗(t)|F(t)) = dα∗(t),
where F(t) is the natural ﬁltration of y∗(t). Thus the drift can be thought of as
E (dy∗(u)|F(u)) ,
the integral of the expected instantaneous returns. Additionally, so long as m∗∈Mc is locally
square integrable then
Var(dy∗(u)|F(u))
Var(dm∗(u)|F(u)),
that is quadratic variation equals the integrated variance of the instantaneous returns. More
generally, allowing jumps in the martingale component of prices, so long as α∗∈FVc
loc, we have
Var(dm∗c(u)|F(u)) +
{∆m∗(s)}2 .
Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold, and Labys discuss the connection between [y∗](t) and
Var(m∗(t)|F(0)), which is important from a practical forecasting viewpoint.
The above analysis implies that if y∗∈SM
p→[y∗](ℏi) −[y∗](ℏ(i −1)) = [y∗]i,
meaning that realised variance consistently estimates daily increments of QV. In turn, so long
In addition, if α∗∈FVc
loc and m∗is square integrable, then
p→[m∗c]i + [m∗d]i =
Var(dm∗c(u)|F(u)) + [m∗d]i,
the integrated variance of the instantaneous returns of the continuous component plus the
quadratic variation of the jump part of m∗. This implies, importantly, that realised variance
cannot be informative about the separate contributions the diﬀusion or jump parts of m∗make
to QV. Instead, in order to break up these two components, we either have to make very speciﬁc parametric assumptions about y∗ ) or use
alternative aggregate volatility statistics. We follow the latter route in this paper.
Stochastic volatility
To extend the results on quadratic variation we will need some additional smoothness assumptions. We start by stating two, after recalling that y∗= α∗+ m∗.
(a) m∗is a stochastic volatility (SV) process5
σ(u)dw(u),
where w is standard Brownian motion, σ(t) > 0, the spot volatility process, is c`adl`ag and
locally bounded away from zero and the integrated variance process
satisﬁes σ2∗(t) < ∞for all t < ∞.
(b) the mean process α∗is continuous.
We call semimartingales satisfying (a) and (b) members of the continuous SV semimartingales class (denoted SVSMc). Clearly SVSMc ⊂SMc ⊂SM, where SMc is the class of
continuous semimartingales.6
Importantly, if y∗∈SVSMc then
[y∗](t) = σ2∗(t).
Under the additional assumption that σ is continuous7, ∂[y∗](t)/∂t = σ2(t). Finally, for all
i = σ2∗(ℏi) −σ2∗(ℏ(i −1)).
5The literature of SV models is discussed by, for example, Harvey, Ruiz, and Shephard , Taylor ,
Ghysels, Harvey, and Renault , Shephard and Kim, Shephard, and Chib .
6This construction looks, at ﬁrst sight, ad hoc. However, this is not true. All local martingales with absolutely
continuous quadratic variation can be written in the form of assumption (a). This result, which is due to Doob
 , is discussed in, for example, Karatzas and Shreve . If m∗∈Mc
loc and α∗is predictable
then, if we impose a lack of arbitrage opportunity, α∗∈BVc
loc. This condition is discussed in Andersen, Bollerslev,
Diebold, and Labys . Hence, in the context of ﬁnancial economics one might argue that assumption
(b) follows from (a). From the Dambis-Dubins-Schwartz Theorem we know that the diﬀerence between Mc
those given in assumption (a) are the local martingales which have only continuous, not absolutely continuous,
quadratic variation.
Hence assumptions (a) and (b) are only slightly stronger than saying prices must have
continuous sample paths.
7More generally, if D−{g(x)} denotes the left derivative of a function g, limε↓0 ε−1 {g(x) −g(x −ε)}, then
D−{[y∗](t)} = σ2(t−). This is relevant when the σ process exhibits jumps and Eraker, Johannes, and Polson ).
We call σ2
i the actual variance and actual volatility, respectively, of the SV component
over the i-th interval.
All these results on SV processes are very well known.
irrespective of the relationship between α∗, σ and w.
Power variation process
The quadratic variation process [y∗] was generalised to the power variation process by Barndorﬀ-
Nielsen and Shephard . Unlike the QV case, power variation is at least initially and Barndorﬀ-Nielsen, Graversen, and Shephard 
for a discussion of the more general case) deﬁned via an equally spaced discretisation of time.
Again we work on the time interval from 0 to t, but now we assume we have observations
every δ > 0 periods of time. Our interest will be in seeing what happens as δ ↓0. This will
determine the probability limit of realised power variation {y∗
deﬁned in (2), which will be
given explicitly at the end of this subsection.
The r-th order power variation process (r > 0) is deﬁned, when it exists, as
{y∗}[r] (t) = p- lim
δ↓0 δ1−r/2
|yj(t)|r ,
where the equally spaced j-th return is
yj = yj(t) = y∗(jδ) −y∗((j −1) δ).
Here, for any real number a, ⌊a⌋denotes the largest integer less than or equal to a.
The normalisation δ1−r/2 is essential in power variation.
1. When r = 2 the normalisation is one and so disappears.
2. When r > 2 the normalisation goes oﬀto inﬁnity as δ ↓0.
3. When r < 2 the normalisation goes to zero as δ ↓0.
The key property of power variation for SVSMc processes is given as follows.
Theorem 1 If y∗∈SVSMc and additionally (σ, α∗) are independent of w, then
{y∗}[r] (t) = µr
µr = E |u|r = 2r/2 Γ
for r > 0 where u ∼N(0, 1).
Proof. See Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard .
Remark 1 It is so far unclear to us how substantial is the impact of relaxing the independence
condition on (σ, α∗) and w. Note, no additional assumptions are made on the (σ, α∗) process
beyond those stated in (a) and (b).
This implies that if σ is continuous8,
{y∗}[r] (t)/∂t
The probability limit of realised power variation follows immediately from the deﬁnition of
the power variation process. Thus under the conditions of Theorem 1, as M →∞,
{y∗}[r] (ℏi) −{y∗}[r] (ℏ(i −1))
Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard have extended the above convergence in probability
to a distribution theory for {y∗}[r] (t) −µr
0 σr(s)ds. This will be discussed in Section 6.4 of
this paper. Andreou and Ghysels have used power variations to test for changes in the
level of volatility in ﬁnancial markets.
Bipower variation process
In the context of multivariate covariation Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard sometimes
found it helpful to study cross terms of the type
where we recall that yj = y∗(jδ) −y∗((j −1) δ). Here we provide an extension of this which will
allow us to understand realised bipower variation, the key innovation in this paper. First we
deﬁne the bipower variation (BPV) process as
{y∗}[r,s] (t) = p- lim
δ↓0 δ1−(r+s)/2
|yj|r |yj+1|s ,
provided this exists. We will deﬁne a more general k-th order power variation process in Section
6.2. Clearly the value of r + s is crucial here, as it determines the δ normalisation. Importantly
{y∗}[r,0] (t) = {y∗}[0,r] (t) = {y∗}[r] (t).
Hence special cases of the BPV process include the power variation process and so, obviously,
If y∗∈SVSMc and additionally (σ, α∗) are independent of w, then we would expect that
for r + s > 0
8Otherwise
{y∗}[r] (t)
{y∗}[r,s] (t) = µrµs
σr+s(u)du,
µr = 2r/2 Γ
We will discuss a proof of this general result elsewhere. Again the importance of the assumed
independence assumption is unclear. Overall, this result provides a second way of accessing
integrated power volatility, extending previous work on realised power variation.
For now we
prove a special case.
Theorem 2 Suppose y∗∈SVSMc and additionally σ is independent of w and α∗= 0. Then,
for any r > 0, we have
{y∗}[r,r](t) = µ2
It is convenient to introduce the notation
δ}[r,r](t) = δ1−r
|yj|r|yj+1|r.
Here, and elsewhere, we use δ rather than M as lower index. The value of the bipower process
{y∗}[r,r] at time t is the probability limit, as δ ↓0, of {y∗
δ}[r,r](t). In determining this limit it
causes no loss of generality to assume that t/δ is an integer M, say.
Let σj > 0 be deﬁned by
j = σ2∗(jδ) −σ2∗((j −1)δ).
We then have
δ}[r,r](t) law
j+1|uj|r|uj+1|r
where the uj are i.i.d. standard normal. This means that
δ}[r,r](t) −µ2
j+1(|uj||uj+1| −µ2
Hence in our proof we need to show three things:
1. As δ ↓0
j+1(|uj||uj+1| −µ2
2. As δ ↓0
3. As δ ↓0
p→σ2r∗(t).
Point 3 is straightforward using Riemann integrability of σ(t) ).
We now take up part 1. To prove (11), let R′ be an independent copy of R and note that
R + R′ can be rearranged as the sum of two sums each of the form
j+1 applies to such a sum, as we indicate
below, yielding S
p→0. Therefore R + R′
p→0 and as R and R′ are independent the same is true
To see that S
cMj = δ1−r
x = w2 −µ2r
where w is standard normal. Then, as is simple to verify, the following three conditions are
1≤j<M cMj →0
MP{|x| ≥c−1
and thus Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard applies.
It only remains to prove part 2 with (12). In fact we have the stronger result that
To establish this rewrite the diﬀerence as follows
Further, letting ψj = δ−1/2σj we ﬁnd
By condition (a) we have, in particular, that
0≤s≤t σ(s) ≤inf ψj ≤sup ψj ≤sup
uniformly in δ. From this it is immediate that ψ2r
M is uniformly bounded from above.
Furthermore,
inf0≤s≤t σ2r(s)
where inf0≤s≤t σ2r(s) > 0 and, by the c`adl`ag property of σ,
p→[σ2r](t),
which implies, together with (14), result (13) and hence (10).
Following the initial draft of this paper, Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard have shown
that the result is not eﬀected by replacing the α∗= 0 condition by a much weaker smoothness
assumption on α∗.
The above result implies the realised bipower variation
σr+s(u)du.
r ∈(0, 2),
a consistent estimator of integrated variance and so gives the same result as the realised variance.
Further, we have the simple result in the SVSMc case that
r ∈(0, 2).
We will see in the next Section that when there are jumps this term will not have a zero
probability limit, but rather will converge to a positive, ﬁnite quantity. It will become clear that
this diﬀerence can be used to test for the presence of jumps.
We now introduce an additional regularity condition.
Condition (V′). The volatility process σ has the property
|σr(ηj) −σr(ξj)| = 0,
for some r > 0 (equivalently for every r > 0) and for any ξj = ξj(δ) and ηj = ηj(δ) such that
0 ≤ξ1 ≤η1 ≤δ ≤ξ2 ≤η2 ≤2δ ≤· · · ≤ξM ≤ηM ≤t.
Using this condition we may strengthen Theorem 2 to the following statement.
Theorem 3 Let the situation be as in Theorem 2 and suppose moreover that σ satisﬁes condition
(V′). Then
|yj|r|yj+1|r = µ2
σ2r(s)ds + op(δ1/2).
Proof By the proof of Theorem 2, particularly the conclusion (13), it suﬃces to note that when
conditions (a) and (V′) hold, then together they imply that
j −σ2r∗(t) = op(δ1/2).
This latter relation is in fact the content of Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard .
The result (15) given in Theorem 3 is essential in deriving distributional limit results for
realised power variation. See Section 6.4 below. Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard have
recently shown that in the case where r = 1 condition (V′) can be dispensed with.
SV process plus large but rare jumps
Rare jumps and quadratic variation
So far we have seen that in SVSMc models realised variance, realised power variation and
realised bipower variation converge to integrals of powers of spot volatility. When we use special
cases of realised bipower variation, then the probability limit is the same as that achieved by
realised variance. In this section we will see how this result changes when we introduce jumps.
Consider the log-price process
y∗(t) = y(1)∗(t) + y(2)∗(t),
with y(1)∗∈SVSMc and
y(2)∗(t) =
where N is a ﬁnite activity, simple counting process9 such that N(t) < ∞(for all t > 0) and
{ci} is a collection of non-zero random variables. In the special case where N is a homogeneous
Poisson process and {ci} are i.i.d. from some distribution D then y(2)∗is a compound Poisson
process (written CPP). Such jump process models have often been used as components of price
processes , Andersen, Benzoni, and Lund , Johannes, Polson, and
Stroud and Chernov, Gallant, Ghysels, and Tauchen ).
The QV for this jump plus SVSMc process is well known ) and is reported below in the following proposition.
Proposition 1 Suppose y(1)∗∈SVSMc and y(2)∗is given in (17), then
Proof. Trivial from (6) and (8).
Rare jumps and power variation
We can generalise the above discussion to deal with power variation. This captures the theoretical eﬀect we are concerned with in this paper.
9A ﬁnite activity counting process is a simple counting process which, with probability one, has a ﬁnite number
of events happening in a ﬁxed interval of time. This rules out inﬁnite activity L´evy processes such as the normal
inverse Gaussian process which have an inﬁnite number of jumps in ﬁnite intervals of time. These processes will
be discussed in Section 6.
Theorem 4 Let y∗= y(1)∗+ y(2)∗with y(1)∗and y(2)∗being independent.
Suppose y(1)∗∈
SVSMc, that is y∗= α∗+ m∗, and additionally that (σ, α∗) are independent of w and y(2)∗is
given in (17). Then
{y∗}[r] (t) =
Remark 2 The same setting has been independently studied recently by Woerner , who
reaches the same conclusion in a general semimartingale framework using a diﬀerent technique.
See also L´epingle for an earlier investigation.
Proof. It is clear that as δ ↓0, then generally
j (t) = y(2)∗(jδ) −y(2)∗((j −1) δ).
It follows from this that when we also normalise the sum, as δ ↓0
for β > 0, r ∈(0, 2)
[y(2)∗](t)
for β = 0, r = 2
for β < 0, r > 2.
Hence the power variation of y(2)∗is either zero, the quadratic variation or inﬁnity, depending
upon the value of r. Furthermore
|yj(t)|r =
+ Op(N(t)),
as there are only N(t) contributions to y(2)∗. As a result we have that
for β = 1 −r/2, r ∈(0, 2)
for β = 0, r = 2
for β < 0, r > 2.
This delivers the required result by deﬁnition of {y∗}[r] (t).
Theorem 4 implies that:
1. When r ∈(0, 2) the probability limit of realised power variation is unaﬀected by the
presence of the jumps.
2. When r > 2 the probability limit is determined by the jump component and so scaling
means this goes oﬀto inﬁnity.
3. When r = 2 both components contribute.
The result is not very sensitive for it would hold for any jump process as long as there are a
ﬁnite number of jumps in any ﬁnite period of time. In particular, then, the jumps can be serially
dependent, or dependent on the ﬁltration generated by w and σ. The above implies that when
r < 2 and σ is continuous10 then σ(t) =
∂{y∗}[r](t)
Rare jumps and bipower variation
The logic of the proof of Theorem 4 carries over to the bipower variation process. In particular
we deliver the stimulating result on bipower given in the following theorem11. The only part of
the result we will use in practice is the max (r, s) < 2 case.
Theorem 5 Let the setting be as in Theorem 4. Then for r > 0 and s > 0
{y∗}[r,s] (t) =
σr+s(u)du,
max (r, s) < 2,
max (r, s) = 2,
max (r, s) > 2,
where x∗(t) is some stochastic process.
Proof. Deﬁning
̸= 0, y(2)
we have an indicator which is one either if there are no jumps or the jumps are contiguous. Then
δ1−(r+s)/2
|yj|r |yj+1|s
δ1−(r+s)/2
|yj|r |yj+1|s dj,j+1 + δ1−(r+s)/2
|yj|r |yj+1|s (1 −dj,j+1) .
The impact of the jumps on the ﬁrst term in (20) of any contiguous jumps goes to zero as δ ↓0
so long as r + s < 2, for the jumps contribute a ﬁnite number of terms to the sum and so
δ1−(r+s)/2
|yj|r |yj+1|s dj,j+1 −δ1−(r+s)/2
10Otherwise when r < 2 then
{y∗}[r] (t)
11We thank Xin Huang from Duke University for pointing out an error in an earlier version of this result and
for deriving the max(r, s) = 2 case.
as the contribution from the contiguous jumps is killed by the scaling δ1−(r+s)/2 ↓0 as δ ↓0.
The condition on r and s can be relaxed to max (r, s) < 2 as long as the probability of two
contiguous jumps goes to zero at rate δ, which is true for simple counting processes. Of course,
under the conditions of the Theorem
δ1−(r+s)/2
for all r and s.
We now work with
|yj|r |yj+1|s (1 −dj,j+1) = O(N(t)),
as the terms in the sum are zero unless there is a jump and there are N(t) jumps. The focus of
attention is on
δ1−(r+s)/2
|yj|r |yj+1|s (1 −dj,j+1)
δ1−(r+s)/2
j+1 + y(2)
(1 −dj,j+1)
+δ1−(r+s)/2
(1 −dj,j+1)
j+1 + y(2)
(1 −dj,j+1)
(1 −dj,j+1) .
So long as s < 2 then
j+1 + y(2)
(1 −dj,j+1)
while likewise if r < 2 then
(1 −dj,j+1)
This delivers the ﬁrst result in (19), while if max(r, s) > 2 both of these terms explode which is
clearly enough to guarantee the third result in (19).
The only issue which remains is when max(r, s) = 2. In that case
δ1−(r+s)/2
|yj|r |yj+1|s (1 −dj,j+1)
has a stochastic limit which combines the jumps and the volatility process.
Remark 3 This result has a special case, of a great deal of applied interest. When r ∈(0, 2)
2−r {y∗}[r,2−r] (t) =
integrated variance. Hence the integrated variance can be consistently estimated in the presence
of rare but large jumps. It also immediately implies that
[y∗] (t) −µ−1
2−r {y∗}[r,2−r] (t) =
the jump contribution to the QV. We believe this is the ﬁrst analysis which has been able to
feasibly decompose the quadratic variation into the contributions from the continuous and jump
components of the log-price. Trivially, we also have that
2−r {y∗}[r,2−r] (t) =
Var(dm∗c(u)|F(u)),
even when there are jumps in m∗and so in y∗.
Remark 4 The above results imply that realised bipower variation has the feature that when
r ∈(0, 2), then
Var(dm∗c(u)|F(u)),
j=N(ℏ(i−1))+1
Thus the use of these statistics can, in theory, separately identify the risk associated with the
diﬀuse element of prices and the jumps.
Some simulations of SV plus large rare jumps
Basic simulation
In this Section we will illustrate some of these results on realised bipower variation by simulating
an SV plus jump process. Throughout we focus on using two special cases of the results given
in (21) and (22). In particular we will study
|yj,i| |yj+1,i|
|yj,i| |yj+1,i|
j=N(ℏ(i−1))+1
Our aim is to see if these convergence results are of any relevance in ﬁnite samples.
We start with a discussion of the spot volatility process. We use a Feller or Cox, Ingersoll,
and Ross square root process for σ2
dσ2(t) = −λ
dt + ωσ(t)db(λt),
where b is a standard Brownian motion process. The square root process has a marginal distribution
σ2(t) ∼Γ(2ω−2ξ, 2ω−2) = Γ (ν, a) ,
with a mean of ξ = ν/a, a variance of ω2 = ν/a2 and
σ2(t), σ2(t + s)
= exp(−λ |s|).
In the context of SV models this is often called the Heston model. We take α∗= 0 and
σ(u)dw(u) +
We rule out leverage and Nelson ) by assuming Cor {b(λt), w(t)} = 0.
We take ℏ= 1, λ = 0.01, ν = 0.1 and a = 0.2. We randomly scatter 10 jumps in a time interval
of 50 days, while the jumps are NID(0, 0.64ν/a). The latter means that when there is a jump,
the jump has the same variance as that expected over 64% of a day period of trading when there
is no jump. Thus these are large but quite rare jumps.
We report results based on M = 12, M = 72 and M = 288, which are typical practical
values for these types of methods. The ﬁrst row of Figure 2 corresponds to M = 12, the second
has M = 72 and the third M = 288. Figures 2(a), (c) and (e) show the sample path of the
y∗and N processes recorded at the resolution of M. Notice we have not used a standard time
series plot here; rather we plot the processes using dots so that it is possible to see the jumps.
As M increases the sample path of the discretised process reveals the jump in the process.
Figures 2(b), (d) and (f) show the sample paths of the daily realised variances, while we
also draw the corresponding daily increments in the quadratic variation, which is obviously the
sum of the integrated variance and the sums of squared jumps. We see that the RV becomes
more accurate with M, as we expect from theory. However, we can also see that it is quite an
inaccurate estimator.

Figures 3(a), (c) and (e) show the more innovative results. It displays our estimator of the
integrated variance, using the theory of realised bipower variation. In particular, as mentioned
above, we are using r = s = 1 in this work. This is contrasted with the actual increment of
the integrated variance. We can see that when M = 12 this is a poor estimator and is, in
particular, inﬂuenced by the large jumps which appear in the sample. However for moderate
M the statistic seems to be quite informative, while when M = 288 the estimator is reasonably
accurate. Figures 3(b), (d) and (f) show the diﬀerence between the realised variance and the
realised bipower variation. The theory suggests this is a consistent estimator of the quadratic
variation of the jump component. For small M it is very inaccurate, but for moderate and large
M the estimator works rather well.
We back up these results by repeating the above analysis but using 5, 000 days, having jumps
of the same size as before but now on average every 20 days. We then focus on the distribution
of the estimation errors. In particular we look in detail at

the realised bipower variation error and, deﬁning
|yj,i| |yj+1,i| ,
we also examine
|yj,i| |yj+1,i|
the realised jump error. The results are given in Table 1. This records the mean error, to see if
the estimators are unbiased, as well as the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles.
For each measure there is little bias even for small M. In the realised variance case the 95%
range of the error falls quite quickly, although the interval is still substantial when M = 576.
An interesting feature is that the errors are roughly symmetric in this analysis. For the realised

bipower variation error the results are rather similar to the RV case. Interestingly the 95%
interval is larger for this error than for the corresponding RV case. For the realised jump error,
the 95% intervals are roughly symmetric.
No jump case
Interestingly, when we repeat the analysis, removing all jumps and comparing the performance
as estimators of σ2
i , we obtained the results given in Table 2 which
indicate that the RV is slightly preferable in terms of accuracy.
A theoretical conﬁrmation of
this result is indicated in Section 6 of this paper.

Improving the ﬁnite sample behaviour
It is clear that
i = [y∗]i −σ2
j=N{ℏ(i−1)}+1
while the estimator
can be negative. Hence it would be sensible to sometimes replace it by the consistent estimator
This would suggest the following estimator of the actual variance of the SV component
Repeating the above experiment based on 5,000 days for the non-linear estimator of the QV
of the jump component (23), we produce the analysis of errors given in Table 3. We see that the
ﬁnite sample behaviour of estimator improves quite considerably. Importantly, the latter term
now has a very short right hand tail, which means we rarely overstate the presence of jumps by
a large amount. Of course this estimator has the disadvantage of being biased.
Jump error

quantiles of the sampling distribution.
Initial empirical work
To illustrate some of the new theory, we return to the dataset discussed in the introduction.
We now work with the full dataset from 1st December 1986 until 30th November 1996. All
calculations will be based on M = 288, that is we will employ 5 minute returns, calculating
aggregate volatility statistics for each day within the sample.
Figure 4(a) shows the time series of the daily realised variance, while 4(b) shows the corresponding realised bipower variation. The diﬀerence between these two estimates, which is our
estimate of the daily increments of QV of the jump component, is given in Figure 4(c). Finally,
4(d) shows the correlograms of the realised variances, the realised bipower variations and the
estimated jump components of QV. The main features of Figure 4 is that the estimate of the

integrated variance is the dominating component of the realised variance. Some of the estimates
of the jump QV are quite large, especially at the start of the period. However, these jumps tend
not to be very serially dependent. The serial dependence in the estimated integrated variances
is larger than for the RVs. This is interesting, although the increase in dependence is quite
modest. During this period, the average value of the jump component to daily QV is 0.0310.
Average realised variance is 0.528, hence the size of the jump component is quite modest for the
Figure 5 focuses on two time-periods with large realised variances12. In both cases we look
at 10 day periods of time, plotting in Figures 5(a) and (c) the log-price process every 5 minutes.
Throughout Figures 5(a) and (c) we plot the prices using dots, rather than the more standard
time series lines. In Figure 5(a) there is a large uptick in the price, with a movement of nearly
two percent in a ﬁve minute period. This occurred on January 15th 1988. The Financial Times
reported on its front page the next day ”The dollar and share prices soared in hectic trading
on world ﬁnancial markets yesterday after the release of oﬃcial ﬁgures showing that the US
trade deﬁcit had fallen to $13.22 bn in November from October’s record level of $17.63 bn.

and maintained the day’s highest levels in late New York business ... .” The 15th had a large
realised variance, shown in 5(b), but a much smaller estimate of the integrated variance. Hence
the statistics are attributing a large component of the realised variance to the jump.
This eﬀect contracts with Figure 5(c) where there is a three unit increase in the log-price,
but this happens over around an hour long period with many positive returns. This happened
on August 19th 1991. In the early hours of that day the Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev
was overthrown after a coup by Communist hardliners. We can see in Figure 5(d) that the
corresponding realised variance is very high, but so is the estimated integrated variance. Hence
in this case the statistics have not ﬂagged up a jump in the price, even though prices were
moving rapidly in one direction.
Extensions and discussion
Robust estimation of integrated covariance
A vital concept in ﬁnancial econometrics is covariance. We can formally base this on the concept
of quadratic covariation. We will discuss this in the context of a bivariate semimartingale (x∗, y∗).
Then the quadratic covariation between x∗and y∗is
[y∗, x∗](t) = p−lim
{y∗(tj) −y∗(tj−1)}{x∗(tj) −x∗(tj−1)}.
Note that using this notation
[y∗, y∗](t) = [y∗](t),
the QV of the y∗process. Quadratic covariation has been recently studied in the econometric
literature by, for example, Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard and Andersen, Bollerslev,
Diebold, and Labys .
In the context of multivariate SVSMc models ) we
= α∗(t) + m∗(t),
Θ(u)dw(u),
loc, the elements of Θ are assumed c`adl`ag and w is a vector of independent standard
Brownian motions. We write Σ(t) = Θ(t)Θ(t)′, and we need to make the additional assumption
0 Σk,l(u)du < ∞, k, l = 1, 2, to ensure that m∗is a local martingale. This setup has the
important property that
[y∗, x∗](t) =
Σ1,2(u)du,
the integrated covariance of the price process. Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold, and Labys 
emphasise the importance of estimating this type of term and they discuss the use of realised
covariation to achieve this.
A distribution theory for this estimator under the above type of
model structure is given in Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard .
An important property of quadratic variation is the so called polarisation result that
[y∗+ x∗](t) = [y∗](t) + [x∗](t) + 2[y∗, x∗](t),
which means that
[y∗, x∗](t) = 1
2 {[y∗+ x∗](t) −[y∗](t) −[x∗](t)} .
Hence we can use realised bipower variation to consistently estimate [y∗, x∗](t), or increments
of it, by estimating each of the individual terms. Further, straightforwardly, this estimator is
robust to jumps and we now have tools for assessing if the dependence between price processes
is aﬀected by the presence of jumps. We will explore this issue elsewhere in some detail.
Generalisation to multipower variation
We deﬁned the bipower variation as
δ↓0 δ1−(r+s)/2
|yj(t)|r |yj+1(t)|s ,
It is clear we can generalise this object by multiplying together a ﬁnite number of absolute
returns raised to some non-negative power. In general we call this idea multipower variation. In
particular the tripower variation process is
{y∗}[r,s,u] (t) = p −lim
δ↓0 δ1−(r+s+u)/2
|yj(t)|r |yj+1(t)|s |yj+2(t)|u ,
r, s, u > 0,
while the quadpower variation process is
{y∗}[r,s,u,v] (t) = p−lim
δ↓0 δ1−(r+s+u+v)/2
|yj(t)|r |yj+1(t)|s |yj+2(t)|u |yj+3(t)|v ,
r, s, u, v > 0.

another new estimator of integrated variance. Figure 6 repeats the experiments reported in
Figure 3 but replaces bipower with tripower. In particular we have plotted the time series of
the realised tripower term

instead of
|yj,i| |yj+1,i| .
1/2 {y∗}[1/2,1/2,1/2,1/2] (t) =
This result is interesting as it is estimating integrated variance based on square roots of absolute
returns, which is quite a robust item. Figure 7 again repeats the previous experiments, but now
based on this quadpower concept. The realised version of the quadpower is
|yj,iyj+1,iyj+2,iyj+3,i|.
We see from Figure 7 that we do not produce very diﬀerent answers.

of this graph is that for one period the estimate of the QV of the jump component is highly
negative. This makes little sense, as we know the jump component has to be non-negative. We
discussed this issue in the context of bipower in Section 4.3. If we use the same strategy here
then we produce much more sensible results. They are plotted in Figure 8. This suggests that
the estimators are reasonably accurate even for quite small samples.

A more robust object of this type is

We will return to this in a moment when we discuss testing for jumps.
Some inﬁnite activity L´evy processes
In our analysis we have shown that the realised power variation of a compound Poisson process
converges in probability to zero when the power is less than two.
An interesting extension of
this result is to L´evy processes with inﬁnite numbers of jumps in ﬁnite time intervals. Then the
question is whether bipower variation is robust to these types of jumps. Here we explore this
problem, without giving a complete solution.
Recall L´evy processes are processes with independent and stationary increments. Examples
of this type of process are the normal gamma (or variance gamma) process and the normal
inverse Gaussian process. These are due to Madan and Seneta and Madan, Carr, and
Chang in the former case and Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Barndorﬀ-Nielsen in
the latter case.
Let z denote a L´evy process. It is characterised by the L´evy-Khintchine representation which
says that we can write
log E exp {iζz(1)} = aiζ −1
1 −eiζx + iζx1B(x)
where a ∈R, σ ≥0, B = [−1, 1] and the L´evy measure W must satisfy
min{1, x2}W(dx) < ∞
and W has no atom at 0.
In this exposition we will assume the drift a and the volatility σ are zero, so z is a pure
jump process. The L´evy measure controls the jumps in the process. If
R W(dx) < ∞then the
process is a compound Poisson process and so has a ﬁnite number of jumps. If this does not
R min{1, |x|}W(dx) < ∞then we say the process is of inﬁnite activity ﬁnite variation
(IAFV). It has an inﬁnite number of jumps in any ﬁnite time interval.
However, bounded
variation feature of the process means that it can be decomposed into
z(t) = z+(t) −z−(t),
where z+ and z−are independent subordinators. Recall a subordinator is a L´evy process with
non-negative increments. Under the more general condition (25) this decomposition into positive
and negative jumps is not possible.
We believe that the results of Section 3 extend to cases where the jump process is of the
L´evy B-activity type and a discussion of this will be given elsewhere. Following the initial draft
of this paper, Woerner has formally studied robustness results of this type, extending the
derivations we have given to cases which allow inﬁnite numbers of jumps in ﬁnite time periods.
Asymptotic distribution
An important question is whether we can extend the convergence in probability result we saw for
realised bipower variation to convergence in distribution. This type of result has been developed
for realised variance by Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard and Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and
Shephard . It has been extended considerably in their work on realised power variation by
Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard and Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard . Following
the initial draft of this paper, Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard have derived the joint
asymptotic distribution of realised bipower and quadratic variation in the r = s = 1 case, under
some rather weak assumptions. Here we just outline the result, leaving the reader to look at
that paper for technical conditions. In particular they show that
|yj||yj+1| −
An implication is that the correlation between these two measures of integrated variance is
constant through time and independent of the model.
This analysis suggests that the realised
variance statistic is, as expected, slightly more eﬃcient than realised bipower variation. This
agrees with the results in Table 2. The correlation between the two statistics is approximately
0.875. The implication is that, under the SVSMc model, there is relatively little additional
information in the realised bipower variation compared to the realised variance. Indeed, as
the generalised least squares estimator of
0 σ2(s)ds, based on the realised variance and realised
bipower variation, will put weights on the realised variance and realised bipower variation which
are approximately one and zero, respectively.
Straightforwardly we can also look at the behaviour of the diﬀerence between realised variance and realised bipower variation. The above limit theory immediately implies that
|yj||yj+1|
→N (0, 0.6091) .
This can be used to test for jumps, using the above as the null distribution. Clearly, it may
be more desirable to look at the diﬀerence of the log of the realised variance and the realised
bipower variation. Using the delta method on the multivariate distribution implies
|yj||yj+1|
→N (0, 0.6091) .
Following the argument in Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard we noted that in this type of
context it is helpful to use Jensen’s inequality which implies that
|yj||yj+1||yj+2||yj+3|
|yj||yj+1|
This suggests using the asymptotic approximation
|yj||yj+1|
0.6091 max
t , P⌊t/δ⌋−3
|yj||yj+1||yj+2||yj+3|
. ³P⌊t/δ⌋−1
|yj||yj+1|
→N (0, 1) .
To illustrate the above theory we return to the Olsen data discussed above and use a onesided test to see if there are jumps in the series. Table 4 gives the percentage of rejections for
the series, together with the associated critical value and signiﬁcance levels. The Table shows
there are around 1 in 5 rejections of the hypothesis of no jumps when we use a 5% signiﬁcance
This falls to around a 1 in 10 rejection when we move to a 1% level.
Following the
initial drafts of this paper, similar empirical results have been reported by Andersen, Bollerslev,
and Diebold who have also studied the use of the diﬀerence between realised variance
and bipower variation to test for jumps on this dataset. They have used such tests to then
build reduced form models to improve upon existing forecasting devices for predicting future
realised variances. Huang and Tauchen and Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard 
have independently and concurrently used simulations to study the ﬁnite sample performance of
these types of tests, reaching broadly similar conclusions that transformed versions of the tests
(such as the log version detailed above) are reasonably well behaved in empirically reasonable
sample sizes.

for it relies on the very ﬂexible auxiliary particle ﬁlters introduced by Pitt and Shephard ,
while corresponding ﬁltering work on discrete time models was carried out by Chib, Nardari,
and Shephard . Andersen, Benzoni, and Lund and Chernov, Gallant, Ghysels, and
Tauchen have used EMM methods to estimate and test some of these models. Maheu and
McCurdy have constructed a jump/GARCH discrete time model for daily data which
attempts to unscramble jumps and volatility changes, while Eraker, Johannes, and Polson 
look at the same issue based on SV models using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and Elerian, Chib, and Shephard
There is also a literature on discrete time parametric models of SV plus jumps.
Nardari, and Shephard use simulation based likelihood inference which allows one to test
for jumps in a standard manner. Other papers on this topic are pointed out in that paper’s
references.
A¨ıt-Sahalia has recently asked the generic question of whether a continuous time
Markov process exhibits jumps? He developed a theory for this based upon transition densities
and then applied this to ﬁnancial data. In some recent stimulating work Mancini , Mancini
 and Mancini has tried to estimate the jump component of quadratic variation.
She does this via the introduction of a jump threshold whose absolute value goes to zero as the
number of observations within each day goes to inﬁnity.
Finally, and closest to this paper, Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and Shephard have studied
the second order properties of realised variance under the assumption that the local martingale
component of prices is a time-changed L´evy process. Such models will have jumps in the price
process except in the Brownian motion special case.
For time-changed L´evy processes the
realised variance is an inconsistent estimator of the increments of the time-change. They used
their results to suggest simple quasi-likelihood estimators of these types of models.
Conclusion
In this paper we have studied the recently formalised concept of realised power variation in the
context of SV models where there can be occasional jumps. We have shown that sometimes the
probability limit of these quantities are unaﬀected by rare jumps. Realised power variation has
inspired us to introduce realised bipower variation. This shares the same robustness property,
but can also be set up to estimate integrated power volatility in SV models. In a range of cases
this produces an estimator of integrated variance in the presence of jumps. To our knowledge
this is the ﬁrst radical alternative to the commonly used realised variance estimator of this
quantity. Importantly when we add jumps to the SV model the probability limit of the bipower
estimator does not change, which means we can combine realised variance with realised bipower
variation to estimate the quadratic variation of the jump component.
Various extensions of our work have been developed. We have outlined multivariate versions
of the methods, a distribution theory and an assessment of the robustness to the α∗process.
We think our paper may open up a number of interesting research avenues for econometricians.
