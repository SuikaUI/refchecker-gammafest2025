Domain shift refers to the well known problem that a model
trained in one source domain performs poorly when applied
to a target domain with different statistics. Domain Generalization (DG) techniques attempt to alleviate this issue by
producing models which by design generalize well to novel
testing domains. We propose a novel meta-learning method
for domain generalization. Rather than designing a speciﬁc
model that is robust to domain shift as in most previous
DG work, we propose a model agnostic training procedure
for DG. Our algorithm simulates train/test domain shift during training by synthesizing virtual testing domains within
each mini-batch. The meta-optimization objective requires
that steps to improve training domain performance should
also improve testing domain performance. This meta-learning
procedure trains models with good generalization ability to
novel domains. We evaluate our method and achieve state of
the art results on a recent cross-domain image classiﬁcation
benchmark, as well demonstrating its potential on two classic
reinforcement learning tasks.
Introduction
Humans are adept at solving tasks under many different conditions. This is partly due to fast adaptation, but also to a
lifetime of encountering new task conditions providing the
opportunity to develop of strategies that are robust to different task contexts. If a human discovers that their existing
strategy fails in a new context they do not just adapt, but further try to update their strategy to be more context independent, so that next time they arrive in a new context they are
more likely to succeed immediately. We would like artiﬁcial
learning agents to solve many tasks under different conditions (domains) and similarly solve the second order task of
constructing models that are robust to change of domain and
perform well ‘out of the box’ in new domains. For example we might like computer vision systems to recognize objects immediately and without retraining, when the camera
type is changed , or reinforcement learning trained agents to perform well immediately when placed
in a new environment or subjected to changed morphology
 – without waiting for adaptation.

Standard learning approaches tend to break down when
applied in different conditions (i.e. to data with different
statistics) than used for training. This is known as domain
or covariate shift , and seriously affects the usefulness of machine learning models as
we do not always have access to training data that is exactly representative of the intended testing scenario. Approaches to addressing this issue can be categorized into domain adaptation (DA) and domain generalization (DG). DA
is relatively well studied, and addresses using unlabelled or
sparsely labelled data in the target domain to quickly adapt a
model trained in a different source domain . The less well studied DG addresses building models that by design function well even in new target/testing domains. In contrast to DA, a DG model is not
updated after training, and the issue is how well it works
out of the box in a new domain. The few existing DG methods typically train on multiple source domains and propose
mechanisms to extract some domain agnostic representation
or model that describes common aspects of known domains
 . They assume that
such a common factor among existing source domains will
persist to new testing domains, and thus provide a basis for
generalization. DG is a harder problem than DA in that it
makes fewer assumptions (target data not required) but for
the same reasons, it may be more valuable if solved.
We take a meta learning approach to DG. Rather than
proposing a speciﬁc model suited for DG , we propose
a model-agnostic training algorithm that trains any given
model to be more robust to domain shift. This is related to
the long standing idea of learning to learn , which has
recently seen a resurgence of popularity with applications
to few-shot learning and learning optimizers . The most related of these studies to ours is
the MAML approach of .
MAML takes a meta-learning approach to few-shot learning by training a single model on a set of source tasks
that is only a few gradient descent steps away from a good
task-speciﬁc model. This meta-optimization objective trains
models suited for few-shot ﬁne-tuning to new target tasks.

The DG problem is different because we to transfer across
domains rather than tasks, and because DG assumes zero,
rather than few training examples of the target problem.
meta-learning
generalization
(MLDG) provides a model agnostic training procedure that
improves the domain generality of a base learner. Specifically, MLDG trains a base learner on a set of source domains by synthesizing virtual training and virtual testing domains within each mini-batch. The meta-optimization objective is then: to minimize the loss on the training domains,
while also ensuring that the direction taken to achieve this
also leads to an improvement in the (virtual) testing loss.
We present analyses that give various perspectives on this
strategy, including as following an optimization trajectory
where the virtual training and virtual testing gradients are
aligned. Overall our MLDG approach has several key bene-
ﬁts: As a meta-learning procedure, it does not introduce any
new parameters, unlike other model-based DG approaches
that grow parameters linearly in the number of source domains resulting in large numbers of total parameters. Similarly MLDG does not place any constraint on the architecture of the base learner and moreover can be applied to both supervised and reinforcement
learning; where prior DG alternatives both constrain the model
architecture and address supervised learning.
To summarize our contributions: We develop a gradientbased meta-learning algorithm that trains models for improved domain generalization ability. Our algorithm can
train any type of base network and applies to both supervised and reinforcement learning settings. We evaluate our
approach on a very recent cross domain image recognition
benchmark and achieve state of the art results, as well as
demonstrating its promising applicability to two classic reinforcement learning tasks.
Related Work
Multi-Domain Learning (MDL)
MDL addresses training a single model that is effective for multiple known
domains . Domain generalization often starts with
MDL on some source domains but addresses training a
model that generalizes well to held out unknown domains.
Domain Generalization
Despite the variety of the different methodological tools, most existing DG methods are
built on three main strategies. The simplest approach is to
train a model for each source domain. When a testing domain comes, estimate the most relevant source domain and
use that classiﬁer . A second approach is
to presume that any domain is composed of an underlying
globally shared factor and a domain speciﬁc component.
By factoring out the domain speciﬁc and domain-agnostic
component during training on source domains, the domainagnostic component can be extracted and transferred as a
model that is likely to work on a new source domain . Finally, there is learning a
domain-invariant feature representation. If a feature representation can be learned that minimizes the gap between
multiple source domains, it should provide a domain independent representation that performs well on a new target domain. This has been achieved with multi-view autoencoders and mean map embeddingbased techniques .
It has also been achieved based on gradient reversal domain
confusion losses in deep networks . Here multiple source domains
are trained with an additional multi-task loss that prefers a
shared representation for which domains are indistinguishable. Although initially proposed for DA rather than DG,
these approaches can be adapted to the DG setting . In contrast to these studies, ours is the ﬁrst to addresses domain generalization via meta-learning.
Neural Network Meta-Learning
Meta-learning for neural networks has a long history , but have resurged
in popularity recently. Recent meta-learning studies have focused on learning good weight initializations for few-shot
learning , meta-models that generate the parameters of other models , or
learning transferable optimizers . Our approach is most related to
those that learn transferable weight initializations, notably
MAML . In MAML a single
shared source model shared is trained using multiple source
tasks. The meta-learning process simulates transfer learning
by ﬁne-tuning, so the global model is updated to solve each
source task in turn based on a few examples and a few gradient descent steps. By training the source model such that
all simulated testing tasks ﬁne-tune well, meta-learning produces a source model that is easy to adapt. Both MAML and
our MLDG are model agnostic in that they apply to any base
architecture and both supervised and to reinforcement learning settings. However, MAML addresses few-shot transfer
to new tasks, rather than zero-shot transfer to new domains.
In our case a different meta-learning objective is necessary
because in DG we will not have access to target examples for
ﬁne-tuning during the actual testing. Therefore we propose
a new meta-learning objective based around simulating domain shift and training such that steps to improve the source
domain also improve the simulated testing domains.
Methodology
Meta-Learning Domain Generalization
In the DG setting, we assume there are S source domains
S and T target domains T . All of them contain the same
task (same label space, and input feature space) but have
different statistics. We deﬁne a single model parametrized
as Θ to solve the speciﬁed task. DG aims for training Θ on
the source domains, such that it generalizes to the target domains. To achieve this, at each learning iteration we split the
original S source domains S into S−V meta-train domains
¯S and V meta-test domains ˘S (virtual-test domain). This is
to mimic real train-test domain-shifts so that over many iter-

ations we can train a model to achieve good generalization
in the ﬁnal-test evaluated on target domains T . The overall methodological ﬂow is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1
and summarized in Algorithm 1. This model-agnostic approach can be ﬂexibly applied to both supervised and reinforcement learning as elaborated in the following sections.
Supervised Learning
We ﬁrst describe how to apply our method to supervised
learning. We assume a loss function l(ˆy, y) between the predicted and true labels ˆy and y. For example in multi-class
classiﬁcation the cross-entropy loss: l(ˆy, y) = −ˆy log(y).
The process is outlined in the steps below.
Meta-Train
The model is updated on all the S −V metatrain domains ¯S in aggregate, and the loss function is,
Figure 1: Illustration of our Meta-Learning Domain Generalization method. Symbols represent different data domains.
where y(i)
indicates the jth point among Ni in the ith domain. The model is parametrized by Θ, so the gradient of Θ
calculated respect to this loss function is ∇Θ, and optimization will update the model as Θ
′ = Θ −α∇Θ.
In each mini-batch the model is also virtually evaluated on the V meta-test domains ˘S. This meta-test
evaluation simulates testing on new domains with different
statistics, in order to allow learning to generalize across domains. The loss for the adapted parameters calculated on the
meta-test domains is as below,
ℓΘ′ (ˆy(i)
where, Ni is the number samples of the ith meta-test domain, and the loss on the meta-test domain is calculated using the updated parameters Θ
′ from meta-train. This means
that for optimization with respect to G we will need the second derivative with respect to Θ.
The meta-train and meta-test are optimized simultaneously, so the ﬁnal objective is:
F(Θ) + βG(Θ −αF′(Θ))
where α is the meta-train step size and β weights meta-train
and meta-test. Objective (Eq. 3) is itself trained by gradient
descent (Alg. 1).
Final-Test
After Eq. 3 is optimized to convergence on the
source domains, we deploy the ﬁnal model Θ on the truly
held-out target domain(s).
Reinforcement Learning
In application to the reinforcement learning (RL) setting, we
now assume an agent with a policy π that inputs states x
and produces actions a in a sequential decision making task:
at = πΘ(xt). The agent operates in an environment deﬁned
by a Markov decision process (MDP) q(xt+1|xt, at) and its
goal is to maximize its return, the (potentially discounted)
sum of rewards R = 
t δtRt(xt, at).
While tasks in a supervised learning setting map to reward
functions in an RL setting ,
domains map to solving the same task (reward function)
with differences in the environment (MDP or observation
function). Thus DG is to achieve an agent with improved
generalization ability in the sense of maintaining ability to
maximize reward when subject to changes in its operating
environment (MDP) – without being allowed any rewarded
 ), or un-rewarded
 ) trials in the target environment for adaptation. The key idea is still to achieve DG by simulating traintest domain shift during training. Meta-optimization then
trains for generalization across environmental conditions.
The overall process is summarized in Algorithm 2 and elucidated in the steps below. Note that the MLDG strategy can
be straightforwardly applied on-policy with policy-gradient
(PG) , or off-policy with Q-learning . For simplicity we describe the PG variant.
Meta-train:
In meta-training, the loss function F(·) now
corresponds to the negative return R of policy πΘ, averaged over all the meta-training environments in ¯S. Update
of the policy parameters Θ is performed by REINFORCE
 ), leading
to updated parameters Θ
Meta-test:
Similarly to the SL approach, we now evaluate
the model on V meta-test domains ˘S. The meta-test loss G is
again the average negative return on meta-test environments.
For RL calculating this loss requires rolling out the metatrain updated policy Θ
′ in the meta-test domains to collect
new trajectories and rewards.
Analysis of MLDG
We provide some analysis to help better understand the proposed method and its motivation. The MLDG objective is:
F(Θ) + βG(Θ −αF′(Θ))
where F(.) is the loss from the aggregated meta-train domains (Eq. 1), G(.) is the loss from the aggregated meta-test
domains (Eq. 2), and F′(Θ) is the gradient of the training
loss F(Θ) w.r.t ‘Θ’. This can be understood as: “tune such
that after updating the meta-train domains, performance is
also good on the meta-test domains”.
For another perspective on the MLDG objective, we can
do the ﬁrst order Taylor expansion for the second term, i.e.
G(x) = G( ˙x) + G′( ˙x) × (x −˙x)
where ˙x is an arbitrary point that is close to x. The multivariable form x is a vector and G(x) is a scalar.
Assume we have x = Θ −αF′(Θ), and we choose the ˙x
to be Θ. Then, we have
G(Θ −αF′(Θ)) = G(Θ) + G′(Θ) · (−αF′(Θ))
and the objective function becomes
F(Θ) + βG(Θ) −βα(G′(Θ) · F′(Θ)).
This reveals that we want to: (i) minimize the loss on
both meta-train and meta-test domains, and (ii) maximize
the dot product of G′(Θ) and F′(Θ). Minimizing the loss
on both domains (i) is intuitive. To understand (ii), recall
the dot operation computes the similarity of two vectors:
a · b = ||a||2||b||2 cos(δ), where δ is the angle between vectors a and b. If a and b are unit normalized, this computes
cosine similarity exactly. Though G′(Θ) and F′(Θ) are not
normalized, the dot product is still larger if these vectors are
in a similar direction.
Since G′(Θ) and F′(Θ) are loss gradients in two sets
of domains, then ‘similar direction’ means the direction of
improvement in each set of domains is similar. Thus the
overall objective can be seen as: “tune such that both domains’ losses are minimized, and also such that they descend in a coordinated way”. In a conventional optimization of arg minΘ F(Θ) + G(Θ), there is no such constraint
on coordination. The optimizer will happily tune asymmetrically, e.g., focusing on which ever domain is easier to minimize. The regularization provided by the third term in Eq. 7
prefers updates to weights where the two optimization surfaces agree on the gradient. It reduces overﬁtting to a single
domain by ﬁnding a route to minimization where both subproblems agree on the direction at all points along the route.
Alternative Variants of MLDG
Based on the discussion above, we propose some variants
inspired by the vanilla MLDG method. Variant MLDG-GC
in Eq. 8 is based on the Taylor expansion and gradient alignment intuition discussed earlier – with the regulariser updated to normalize the gradients so that it indeed computes
cosine similarity.
F(Θ) + βG(Θ) −βα
F′(Θ) · G′(Θ)
∥F′(Θ)∥2∥G′(Θ)∥2
Another perspective on ‘similar direction’ gradients is that
once meta-train has converged, you also no longer need to
update the parameters on the meta-test domains. I.e., at a
good solution, meta-test gradients are close to zero. With
this intuition variant MLDG-GN is proposed in Eq. 9.
F(Θ) + β∥G′(Θ −αF′(Θ))∥2
Clearly MLDG-GN needs a good initialization to be reasonable, so we initialize MLDG-GN with the domain aggregation baseline. In the experiments section we will compare
these alternative variants to the initially proposed MLDG.
Related Methods
Related to MLDG-GN, squared gradient magnitude loss (SGM) was concurrently proposed in
 for few-shot recognition. The
objective function with SGM loss has the form F(Θ) +
2. This similar to Eq. 9 when α = 0, but the difference is that, F and G are classiﬁcation losses for a large
dataset and a small dataset respectively (to simulate the fewshot learning scenario), and there is no domain (distribution)
shift between these two datasets, though the small one is inadequate to ﬁt the classiﬁer well. These methods are similar
in that they are both looking for matched classiﬁers (between
large and small datasets v.s. between meta-train and metatest datasets), but their motivations are different: to reduce
the required training data v.s. to make the model domain invariant.

Experiments
To evaluate our method, we compare it with various alternatives on four different problems, including an illustrative
synthetic experiment, a challenging recent computer vision
benchmark for multi-class classiﬁcation across different domains, and two classic reinforcement learning problems,
Cart-Pole and Mountain Car. In each case we compare to
the baseline of aggregating the data from all source domains
to train a single model that ignores domains entirely, as well
as various alternative DG methods. As shown in , the former simple baseline can be very effective and
outperform many purpose designed DG models.
Experiment I: Illustrative Synthetic Experiment
To illustrate our approach, we construct a synthetic binary
classiﬁcation experiment. We synthesize nine domains by
sampling curved deviations from a diagonal line classiﬁer.
We treat eight of these as sources for meta-learning and hold
out the last for ﬁnal-test. Fig. 2a shows the nine synthetic domains which are related in form but differ in the details of
their decision boundary. A one-hidden layer MLP (50 hidden neurons, RELU activation) is used as the base classiﬁer.
Baselines:
MLP-All: Simple baseline of aggregating all
source domains for training. MLDG: Our main proposed
MLDG method (Eq. 4). MLDG-GC and MLDG-GN: variants of our method in Eq. 8 and Eq. 9 respectively.
From the results Fig. 2 we can see that the baseline MLP-ALL over-ﬁts on the training domains. Despite
aggregating eight sources, it ﬁts a curve in the bottom left
corner rather than the underlying diagonal line. Our methods
all draw nearly straight lines. These results illustrate that the
MLDG approach helps to avoid overﬁtting to speciﬁc source
domains and learn a more generalizable model.
Experiment II: Object Recognition
We next evaluate the efﬁcacy of MLDG on a recent challenging object recognition DG task in computer vision. Specifically, we used the PACS multi-domain recognition benchmark, a new dataset designed for the cross-domain recognition problems 1. This dataset has 9991 images in total across 7 categories (‘dog’, ‘elephant’, ‘giraffe’,
‘guitar’, ‘house’, ‘horse’ and ‘person’) and 4 domains of different stylistic depictions (‘Photo’, ‘Art painting’, ‘Cartoon’
and ‘Sketch’). The diverse depiction styles provide a significant domain gap. The goal is to train in set of domains and
recognize objects in a disjoint domain. E.g., recognize photos given only various artistic depictions for training.
Baselines:
We use the ImageNet pre-trained AlexNet
CNN as the base
network in each competitor for fair comparison, and compare the following models: D-MTAE: a multi-task auto encoder designed for the DG problems .
Deep-All: Vanilla AlexNet trained on the aggregation of
data from all source domains. This baseline that outperforms many prior DG methods as presented in . DSN: The domain separation network learns speciﬁc
and shared representation components for the source and
target domains . We re-purpose the
original DSN from the domain adaptation to the DG task.
AlexNet+TF: the low-rank parametrized network provides
prior state of the art on this benchmark .
We implement MLDG in Tensorﬂow. We use
SGD optimizer with learning rate 5e −4 (exponential decay
is used with decay step 15k and decay rate 0.96) and minibatch 64. Meanwhile, parameters α, β, γ are set to 5e−4, 1.0
and 5e −4. For ﬁnal-test, we use the best performing model
on the validation set after 45k iterations.
The comparison with state of the art on the PACS
benchmark is shown in Table 1. From the results, we can see
that MLDG surpasses the other baselines including the best
prior method AlexNet+TF . We note that this
good performance is achieved without any special architecture design and without growing the size of the model in
proportion to the number of domains (both of which are required in each of D-MTAE, DSN, and AlexNet+TF). This
illustrates the ﬂexibility of MLDG, and also highlights that
its scalability compared to alternatives. AlexNet+TF for example requires approximately 2GB of memory per domain
with batch size 64, meaning that it cannot be applied to more
than 5 source domains on a contemporary GPU.
Analysis of MLDG learning:
We next perform some ablation experiments to understand: (i) whether it is important
to use MLDG end-to-end way within a CNN, and (ii) verify
the impact of the meta-optimization strategy speciﬁcally.
To answer the ﬁrst question of where it is important to employ MLDG learning, we compare the variant MLDG (FC):
Only apply MLDG learning on the FC layers of AlexNet.

This is in contrast to our full model MLDG (CNN) , which
applies learning to all layers of AlexNet. Comparing MLDG
(FC) to vanilla Deep-All AlexNet in Table 2, we see a beneﬁt
of ≈1.6% is obtained by MLDG learning on the FC layers.
Comparing full MLDG we see that a further ≈1.1% beneﬁt
is obtained by applying MLDG learning to the convolutional
layers, for a total of ≈2.7% margin over Deep-All.
To verify the impact of the meta-optimization strategy, we
apply MLDG with setting α = 0, in which case the objective
is merely the sum of the training and validation (meta-test)
domains’ losses. From the results in Table 2, we see that it
performs comparably with Deep-All. Thus the key beneﬁt of
MLDG is indeed in the meta-optimization step.
Analysis of MLDG variants:
In the Table 3, the original MLDG method is compared to the two variants also
proposed in the methodology. In this experiment we found
that while the MLDG-GC (cosine) and MLDG-GN (gradient
norm) variants provide some beneﬁt compared to Deep-All,
the vanilla MLDG performs best.
Experiment III: Cart-Pole
We next demonstrate that MLDG also applies to RL problems. First we study the classic Cart Pole problem . The objective is to balance a pole upright
by moving a cart. The action space is discrete – left or right.
The state it has four elements: the position and velocity of
cart and angular position and velocity of the pole.
We perform two sub-experiments by modifying
the OpenAI Gym simulator to provide environments with
different properties. In the ﬁrst we vary one domain factor
by changing the pole length. We simulate 9 domains with
pole lengths [0.5, 1.0, . . . , 4.5]. In the second we vary multiple domain factors – pole length [0.5, 2.5, 4.5] and cart mass
 . In both experiments we randomly choose 6 source

domains for training and hold out 3 domains for (true) testing. Since the game can last forever if the pole does not fall,
we cap the maximum steps to 200. We train on the observed
domains for 500 games per domain. Then, for each held-out
domain, we play 500 games, and report the average reward.
For fair comparison, the policy architecture for all models is
a 1-hidden layer neural network with 50 hidden units. The
reward structure is +1 for each time-step the pole is successfully balanced, so the maximum reward is 200. All methods are trained with vanilla REINFORCE policy gradient
 .
Baselines:
We compare the following alternative approaches: RL-All: The reinforcement-learning analogy to
‘Deep-ALL’ in the recognition experiment. Trains a single policy by aggregating the reward from all six source
domains. RL-Random-Source: Different from RL-All, it
trains on a single randomly selected source domain. Total
training trials are controlled so it gets the same number of
trials in one domain as RL-All gets in multiple domains.
RL-Undobias: Adaptation of the (linear) undo-bias model
of updated to non-linear multi-layer network as per . The neural network is trained to
factor domain-speciﬁc and a single domain-agnostic components on six source domains. The domain agnostic component is then transferred for testing on held out ﬁnal-testing
domains. RL-MLDG: Our MLDG. RL-MLDG-GC: Our
MLDG variant. RL-MLDG-GN: Our MLDG variant. In
each mini-batch, we split the S = 6 source domains into
V = 2 meta-test and S −V = 4 meta-train domains.
All experiments are repeated 10 times to reduce the impact of speciﬁc observed/held-out domain sampling. From the results in Tables 4 and 5, we see the impact of domain shift. No methods reach 200 (upper bound

the proposed MLDG provides the best domain generalization and signiﬁcantly outperform the baselines. It is interesting to note that RL-Random-Source outperforms RL-All
in Table 4, which is different than in vision problems where
simply aggregating more domains is usually a reasonable
strategy. Although RL-All is exposed to more diverse data,
learning a single policy by naively ‘averaging’ over rewards
for multiple distinct problems can sometimes be detrimental
 ,
Analysis of MLDG variants:
Comparing MLDG with its
variants MLDG-GC and MLDG-GN we found that MLDG-
GN is comparable to vanilla MLDG on this problem, while
MLDG-GC is slightly worse.
Experiment IV: Mountain Car
Our second RL experiment is the classic mountain car problem . The car is positioned between
two mountains, and the agent needs to drive the car (back or
forth) so that it can hit the peak of the right mountain. The
difﬁculty of this problem is that the car engine is not strong
enough to drive up the right mountain directly. The agent has
to ﬁgure out a solution of driving up the left mountain to ﬁrst
generate momentum before driving up the right mountain.
The state observation in this game consists two elements:
the position and velocity of the car. There are three available
actions: drive left, do nothing, and drive right.
We simulate domain bias by randomly drawing the height of the mountains in each domain. Similar to
Cart-Pole, we simulate 9 domains in total, and 3 domains
are held-out. In contrast to Cart-Pole, it is very difﬁcult for a
random policy to ﬁnish a full game, as it is likely to be stuck
forever. Thus instead of policy gradient, we use Q learning
 for this problem as the base RL
algorithm, more specially DQNs . For held
out domains we play 100 games each without updating. The
reward structure is -1 each time step before reaching the target. The Q-network is again a 1 hidden layer MLP.
Baselines:
We evaluate the following alternatives
Random-Source: Trains a single policy on one random
source domain. RL-All: Trains a single policy on 6 source
domains in aggregation. RL-Undobias: DG parametrized
Q-network adaptation of 
as per cart-pole. RL-MLDG: Our MLDG. And its variants
RL-MLDG-GC and RL-MLDG-GN. In each mini-batch,
we split the S = 6 source domains into V = 2 meta-test
domains, and S −V = 4 meta-train domains.
All experiments are repeated 10 times to reduce
the impact of random observed/held-out domain splits. From
the results in Table 6, we again observe the performance
drops from observed domains and held-out domains. In this
benchmark, succeeding within 110 steps is a good outcome.
So a reward of -110 is a good score for within domain evaluation. I.e., in the absence of domain shift. Since it is possible for an agent to never succeed on this benchmark, particularly when testing in a distinct domain from training,
we apply a limit of 20, 000 steps maximum. For DG testing, most methods have some failed trials (> 20, 000 steps)
in ﬁnal-test. The average reward is calculated by ignoring
those failed cases. Therefore we report both failure rate and
the average reward (negative time to success) in the successful cases. The results show that our vanilla MLDG method
outperforms the alternatives: (i) Its average reward is better
than RL-All and similar to RL-UndoBias. However (ii) its
fail rate is lower than RL-UndoBias. Unlike Cart-Pole here
RL-All is more effective than Random-Source.
Analysis of MLDG variants:
Only vanilla MLDG performed well here. MLDG-GC had low failure rate but low
return, while MLDG-GN had very high failure rate.
Discussion
The experiments show that MLDG-based meta-learning can
effectively alleviate domain-shift in diverse problems including supervised and re-reinforcement learning scenarios.
Whether training on the aggregate of multiple source domains was a good strategy turned out to be problem dependent (yes for PACS vision benchmark and mountain car,
but not for cart pole). The extended variants of the MLDG
model MLDG-GC (explicit gradient direction alignment)
and MLDG-GN (gradient norm) also had mixed results with
MLDG-GC performing second best on PACS, but MLDG-
GN performing best on Cart-Pole. Nevertheless the core
MLDG strategy was highly effective across all problems and
always outperformed prior alternatives.
We note that studies have used the terms ‘domain’ and
‘task’ in different ways . Some problems we
solved here (e.g., poles of different length) have been termed
‘tasks’ in other studies , which would use ‘domain’ to refer to Cart-Pole versus Mountain Car. We use the term domain in the sense
of the pattern recognition community , where
one can learn a model with better ‘cross domain generalization’. E.g. a recognition model that is robust to recognizing
photos vs sketches; or a policy that is more robust being deployed with poles of a different length than it was trained
on. Note that if parameters like pole-length were observed,
this would be a ‘parametrized’ or ‘contextual’ policy situation - for which methods already exist .
But in our case what meta-learning has achieved is to learn a
policy that is robust to (i.e., obtains high reward despite of)
hidden changes in the underlying MDP. For example balancing poles of diverse but unknown lengths.
Conclusion
We proposed a meta-learning algorithm for domain generalization. Our method trains for domain generalization
by meta-optimization on simulated train/test splits with
domain-shift. Unlike prior model-based domain generalization approaches, it scales well with number of domains. It
is model agnostic so can be applied to different base network types, and both to supervised and reinforcement learning problems. Experimental evaluation shows state of the art
results on a recent challenging visual recognition benchmark
and promising results on multiple classic RL problems.
