of various purchases of 8-candle 100-volt Edison-Swan lamps

lamps that we have received contained among them certain
lamps marked " 100 B. 8," which not only differed in the
marking but also in the filament being of a simple horse-shoe

Lamb and Basset, we find that even when friction is
neglected lon. ,.g waves in a rectangular canal, must neeessaril, y
change their term as they advance; becoming steeper an front
and less steep behind t.
Yet since the investigations of
de Boussinesq$, Lord Rayleigh§, and St. Venant II on the
solitary wave, there has been some cause to doubt the truth
of this assertion.
Indeed, if the reasons adduced were really
decisive, it is difficult to see why the solitary wave should

make an exception*; but even Lord Rayleigh and McCowan ¢,
who have successfully and thoroughly treated the theory of
this wave, do not directly contradict the statement in question.
They are, as it seems to us, inclined to the opinion that the
solitary wave is only stationary to a certain approximation.
It isthe desire to settle this question definitively which has
led us into the somewhat tedious calculations which are to be
found at the end of our paper.
We believe, indeed, that from
them the conclusion may be drawn, that in a frictionless liquid
there may exist absolutely stationary waves and that the form
of their surface and the motion of the liquid below it may be
eXpressed by means of rapidly convergent series.
order that these lengthy calculations might not obscure other
results, which were obtained in a less elaborate way, we have
postponed them to the last part of our paper.
First, then, we investigate the deformation of a system
of waves of arbitrary shape but moving in one direction only,
i. e. we consider one of the two systems of waves, starting in
opposite directions in consequence of any disturbance, after
their complete separation from each other.
By adding to the
motion of the fluid a uniform motion with velocity equal
and opposite to the velocity of propagation of the waves, we
may reduce the surface of such a system to approximate, but
t perfect, rest.
n°If, then, 1T ~ (7 being a small quantity) represent the
elevation of the surface above the bottom at a horizontal dis-
tance x from the origin of coordinates, we have succeeded in
deducing the equation
where a is a small but arbitrary constant, which is in close
connexion with the exact velocity of the uniform motion given
to the liquid, and where o-----½18- T1 depends upon the depth
1 of the liquid, upon the capillary tension T at its surfac% and
upon its density p.
On assuming ~t =0 we of course obtain the differential
Though the theory of the solitary wave is duly discussed in the
treatise of Basset~ the inconsistency of his result with the doctrine of
the necessary chau~e of form of long waves seems not to have sufficiently
attracted the attentmn of the author.

equation for stationary waves, and it is easily shown that the
well-known equation
of the solitary wave is included as a particular case in the
general solution of this eTlation.
But, in referring to this
kind of wave, we have to notice the result that, taking
capillarity into account, a negative wave will become the sta-
tionary one, when the depth of the liquid is small enough.
On proceeding then to the general solution, a new type of
long stationary wave is detected, the shape of the surface
being determined by the equation

We propose to attach to this type of wave the name of
enoldal waves (in analogy with siuusoidal waves).

values of k they bear more and more resemblance to sinusoidal
waves, though their general aspect differs in this respect, that
their elevations are narrower than their hollows; at least
when the liquid is not too shallow, in which latter case this
peculiar feature is reversed by the influence of capillarity.
For very large values of k these cnoidal waves coincide
with the train of oscillatory waves of unchanging shape dis-
covered by Stokes ~, which therefore in the theory of long
waves t constitutes a particular case of the enoidal form.
Indeed the equations obtained by Stokes, when written in
our notation~ becomes

This is a small fraction only when ~1~ the modulus, is small,
but the cnoidal waves then resemble sinusoidal waves ; and it
is obvious that in this case the equation of their surface may
be developed in a rapidly convergent Fourier-series, of which
Sir G. Stok'es has given the first two terms.
After some more discussion about these cnoidal waves~ con-
cerning their velocity of propagation and the motion of the
particles of fluid below their surfac% we proceed to a closer
examination of the deformation of long waves.
To this effect
we apply the equation for ~
to various types of non-shationary
waveg~ and it will appear that~ though sinusoidal waves be-
come steeper in front when advancing, other types of waves
may behave otherwise.
I. The Formula for d~l
In our investigations (in accordance with the method used
by Lord Rayleigh, Phil. Mag. 1876~ vol. i. p. "257~ whose
paper has been or' great influence on our researches)~ we start
from the supposition that the horizontal and vertical u and v
of the fluid may be expressed by rapidly convergent series of

v=y~l +Y~¢~+ . . .
where y represents the height of a particle above the bottom
of the canal, and where f~f1,. • • ~bl~ ~,.. • are functions of x
Of course the validity of this assumption must be
proved later on by the fact that series of this description can
be found satisfying all the conditions of the problem.
From one of these conditions~ viz, the incompressibility of
the liquid~ which is expressed by ~-~+~

It is obvious that this solution coincides with the one usually
given for the case of long waves of arbitrary shape made
stationary by attributing to the fluid a velocity equal and
opposite to that of the waves, on the assumption that the
velocity in a vertical direction may be neglected and that
the horizontal velocity may be considered uniform across each
section of the canal.

When k=0 they determine the motion of the fluid for a
solitary wave.
In the first place we now will endeavour to calculate the
velocity of propagation.
For the solitary wave this is simple
enough. If we consider that the liquid at infinity is brought
to rest when a uniform motion with a horizontal velocity
is added to the motion expressed by (21) and (22), it is clear
that this velocity, with reversed sign, must be taken for the
velocity of propagation of the solitary wave.
But for a train of oscillatory waves Sir G. Stokes has
shown * that various definitions of this velocity may be given,
leading at the higher order of approximation to different
values. It seemed to us most rational to define it as the
velocity of propagation of the wave-form when the ]wrlzontal
momentum of the liquid has been reduced to zero by the
addition of a uniform motion. This definition corresponds
to the second one of Sir G. Stokes. According to it, we have
to solve the equation

IV. Deformation of _hfon-Stationa~j Waves.
In order to study the deformation of non-stationary waves,
we will now apply our formula (1"2) to various types of waves.

wave whose surface is given by

C]~ange of Form of Long Waves.
~vh~ch the first is due to a true change of form of the wave-
surface, whilst the second may be attributed to a small
advancing motion of the wave~ which is left after the addition
of the uniform motion with velocity q0= v/fl • To this effect
we have still at our disposal the quantity a, whose close con-
nexion with the uniform motion, which we have added in
order to make the wave nearly stationary~ has been indicated
One of the best ways to obtain the desired separation is
certainly to make stationary the highest point of the wave,
and this is effected by fulfilling the condition
'~ (a + 2~p ') = 3 (4~p ~ -- 10,
~ = 4(rp2--~h ;
for in that case equation (32) is simplified to
d~ __ _ 3q~ (4ap ~- h) sech ~ Tx. tanh ~ px ; . (33)
and then~ for x= O,
is zero together with ~--~.
In discussing this equation (33), we see at once that a
solitary wave (31) is stationary when h---4(rp~; and this is in
accordance with the equation (17) of the stationary solitary
wave which we have obtained above.
When h>4¢p ~, the
change of form of the wave, calculated from (33), is shown
by the dotted line in fig. 2.
ttere the wave becomes steeper in front*, whilst for
h < 4~T ~ the figure would show the opposite change of form,
when, contrary to the opinion expressed by Airy and others,
the wave becomes less steep in front and steeper behind.
• The left side of the figure is the front side of the wave, because the
wave has been made stationary by the application of a positive velocity
(i. e. from left to right) to the fluid.

If, now, we take account of the fact that, as may easily
be inferred from (31), the wave-surface becomes steeper in
proportion as p is increased, we are then justified in saying
that a solitary wave which is steeper than the stationary on%
corresponding to the same height, becomes less steep in front
and steeper behind, but that its behaviour is exactly opposite
when it is less steep than the stationary one.
Cnoidal Waves.--Applying formula (12) to the cnoidal

gore fig. 3 shows the change of form calculated for the
case h --4~p ~ > 0.
When h--~r3l~p~=O, the waves are stationary in accord-
ance with (20), whilst for h--4~M~< 0 they become steeper
behind; and this last result~ since/) is inversely proportional
to the wave-length~ may be stated by saying that cnoidal
waves become less steep in front and steeper behind when,
for a given modulus and a given height, their length is smaller
than the one required for the stationary wave of this modulus
and height.
In proportion as M is taken smaller the cnoidal waves
more and more resemble sinusoidal waves. They would take
the sinusoidal form for M-- 0, but then an infinitely small wave-
length would be required for the stationary case.
reason sinusoidal waves may always be considered as enoidal
waves whose length is too large to be stationary, that is, they
are always becoming steeper in front.

From the equations (46), (47), (48), (51), (52), (53), the
six quantities q~ r, s, t~ a, and b may be calculated, and if we
had retained everywhere terms of one higher order, we mi_~ht
have got eight equations with eight unknown quantities, &c.

VI. Calculation of the E!tuation of the Surface.
We will now show how for the equation of the surface of a
stationary train of waves a more correct expression than (20)
can be deduced•
For this purpose we have to integrate
the differential equation (39)7 or rather we have to prove that
a series can be given which solves this equation to any desired

Now such a series may be obtained in
the following manner.
,,=t,~en~½'~Va(h,+k~) (M=,,/
Vhl + kl ]
represent,the solution of an equation
,lW~=av,(hl--qql)(kl+vl), . . . .
where hi and kl have values which are slightly different from
those of h and k in (39); then these values and the coefficients
a~/~ &c., of a series
may be determined in such a way* that this series (62)
satisfies the equation (39).
Indeed, substituting (62) in (39) and taking into account
(61), equation (39) reduces to
(~, + ~,e,7, + 3,),,7,' + ...)'(h,--,~,)(k, +,1,)
= (~, +,e,7, + ,,,,,~,' + ...)(h - ~,,~, --,e,,, ~-,,/,,'~ +...)
(k + ~,,7,
+B,£' ÷ ~,,7, ~ + ...)(:1 + b~,7, + (bB + e,,),,* +...),
and it is only necessary to equalize the coefficients of the
corresponding terms of both members of this equation.
If we retain all terms to the fourth order, we find in this
way~ after some reductions :--
,:,, (t,, - kl)-
a"(h -- k) -- (ba~-- 3,S)hk = 0 . . . . . .
_as + a4_ (ha4_ 2~/~) (h-- k) -- (e~ ~ -- "2ba~/3 + 8~-- 5a~)hk = 0 (65)

--419~--6nT+ca'+4ba~t~+3at~+3a~7=O." . . . . . .
To a first approximation these equations are satisfied by
hi--h; k~=k; a----i; /2=hi 7=b~+½o
If then we substitute in (63)~ (64), (65)~ and (66)
hl=h +e~ kl=k +ae, a=l+al~ /~----b+fll
where a 1 and ~1 are quantities of the first~ e and ~ of the
second order, we find from these equations by second approxi-
* The coefficient a in (61) might also have been chosen slightly
different in value from a in (39), but this would only have introclueed
an unnecessary indeterminateness ia the solution,

~=--b(1~--k);
Bl=(--2~+~)(1~--k)..
Substituting as a tMrd approximation :--
h~=h--bhk + ¢1 ; kl--k +bhk +cel, a=l--b(h--k) +a~,
we obtain finally~
~ = ½~7~k(-1~ + 2k); ~, = ~ ~l~k(~l~-k) ; ~ = (t~-- ~, ~)(la- l~k + k~).(T0)
Hence the equation of the surface of the waves is, including
all terms of the third order :--
,= [1 --bq,--k) + (b~--~c) (t~-- 1~k + k~)],l + [b + (--2b ~
where ~]l=hlcn'~,Ja(]~l..{-]¢l)(l~'-~~)., ((,0)
hi = h -- bhk + ½ch# ( -- h + 2k); k~ = k + bhk + ~ chk (2h -- k). (72)

; b--~+...;
whereas the value of c and more correct expressions for a and
b could only have been obtained by means of s~ill more tedious
calculations, which we have not executed.
If we confine ourselves to that degree of approximation for
which all the calculations have been effected~ we may write
for the equatioa of the wave-surface :--
3 (1~//-- k)]~l + ~ ~/1' . . . . .
~,=h ~n~-i(1- 5(I~-k)~. /~h +/~)

For the solitary wave, when k---O, we have ~

been deduced by McCowan, Phil. Meg. vol. xxxii. (1891), p. 48.
