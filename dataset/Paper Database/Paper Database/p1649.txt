Falciparum malaria persists in hard-to-reach areas or demographic groups that are missed by conventional healthcare
systems but could be reached by trained community members in a malaria post (MP). The main focus of a MP is to
provide uninterrupted and rapid access to rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and artemisinin-based combination therapy
(ACT) too all inhabitants of a village. RDTs allow trained community members to perform malaria diagnosis accurately and prescribe appropriate treatment, reducing as much as possible any delay between the onset of fever and
treatment. Early treatment with ACT and with a low-dose of primaquine prevents further transmission from human
to mosquito. A functioning MP represents an essential component of any malaria elimination strategy. Implementing
large-scale, high-coverage, community-based early diagnosis and treatment through MPs requires few technological
innovations but relies on a very well structured organization able to train, supervise and supply MPs, to monitor activity and to perform strict malaria surveillance.

Background
Despite recent significant progresses towards elimination
in several countries in Asia, Africa and South America,
malaria remains a major health issue in many tropical
regions where it thrives in countries with a weak healthcare system . In the last 20 years significant increases
in investment have resulted in the development of new
tools to combat this parasitic disease, the most common
of mankind. Some of the newest tools require expensive and complex technologies that are not available to
national malaria programmes, or are still under trial (vaccines, insecticides, genetically modified mosquitoes) .
Others are already available, such as long-lasting insecticidal bed nets (LLINs), rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and
artemisinin-based combination treatment (ACT). Their
large-scale deployment probably explains most of the
decrease in malaria-related morbidity and mortality in
Southeast Asia and Africa as well as renewed interest in
malaria elimination . However, in order to control
malaria (reduction of morbidity and mortality) and eliminate it (interruption of the transmission cycle), it is
essential to identify and treat infected individuals early in
the course of the illness. To achieve this goal, everyone
living in malaria-endemic areas must have easy access to
reliable diagnostics and effective treatment. This is one of
the most difficult tasks encountered by national malaria
programmes.
The aim of the present article is to discuss in detail the
concept of early diagnosis and treatment (EDT) of falciparum malaria cases. First, the rationale for communitybased EDT and the concept of the malaria post (MP) are
presented. Second, the novelties in tools and approaches
for the successful deployment of MPs are detailed. Third,
evidence of the impact of widespread deployment of
community-based EDT is described, followed by the
requirements for regional integration of an MP network
as part of a falciparum malaria elimination strategy.
Finally, an outline of the challenges to be met to ensure
the sustainability of EDT by MPs is provided.
Rationale for community‑based EDT
EDT provides a means of decreasing transmission of
Plasmodium falciparum from symptomatic individuals.

In P. falciparum infections symptoms usually occur
when the density of asexual parasites reaches a pyrogenic threshold, approximately 12–14 days after an infective bite . Mature gametocytes are the sexual stages
that are infective for mosquitoes. They emerge seven to
15 days after the onset of symptoms . Treating P. falci‑
parum-infected patients within 24–48 h after fever onset
is likely to prevent further transmission of the parasite.
Conversely, patients who delay treatment are more likely
to remain infectious even after being treated because
gametocytes may persist for several weeks after clearance of asexual parasites . Patients who experience
a recurrence of their infection because they received an
ineffective or incomplete treatment have higher gametocyte carriage and contribute disproportionately to transmission .
The malaria post
Most healthcare delivery systems have a concentric
structure centred on a referral hospital. At the periphery are dispensaries or health posts where people from
surrounding villages go when they are ill. But individuals living in endemic regions face many barriers
to accessing malaria diagnosis and treatment because
of geographic distances or travel difficulties, as well as
socio-cultural, economic, political, and legal factors
 . Most of these problems can best be addressed
through diagnosis and treatment based within the community .
Community-based EDT for malaria is implemented
through a simple structure: the malaria post (MP). An
MP is defined by three main criteria: (1) trained personnel; (2) quality RDT; and, (3) effective anti-malarial
drugs. The MP is a simple structure that provides continuous access to reliable diagnosis and effective treatment for any clinical malaria cases from the community
within 24–48 h of fever onset. The minimalistic nature of
the MP makes it feasible to set up and maintain in difficult settings where malaria persists. An effective MP
presents several important particularities: it offers free
services and continuous availability of staff and supplies;
it ensures diagnosis and treatment of clinical malaria; and
it is part of a dense network designed to have an impact
on malaria at the regional level. These attributes allow
large-scale implementation of efficient malaria EDT by
MP in almost any setting. A network of MP is the necessary backbone on which to build a P. falciparum malaria
elimination programme (Fig.  1). MP should be located
within an easy walking distance (e.g., 15 min) from any
home, keeping in mind that a short geographical distance
is a necessary factor for access, but not sufficient if social,
behavioural and other barriers are overlooked.
Costs and cost‑effectiveness of MP for malaria elimination
Apart from ACT and RDTs, an MP requires very little
equipment: pregnancy tests and antimalarial treatment
for pregnant women, paracetamol for non-malaria fever,
a watch or clock to ensure timely reading of RDT and a
scale for ACT dosing (see Additional file 1 for a complete
list of supplies). MPWs should be provided with a reference handbook, including drug-dosing tables and decision algorithms. Used RDTs should be collected monthly
for quality control and adequate disposal. In the largescale deployment of EDT in Eastern Myanmar realized by
the METF (Fig. 1), the monthly cost of an MP is around
US$160, including the management of the MP network
(Fig. 2) . Community-based treatment, LLIN deployment and combined strategies have been assessed in a
modelling work in the context of Southeastern Myanmar.
In a malaria control perspective, the combined strategy
was the most cost-effective, especially in communities
where access to healthcare was difficult, even though
transportation costs increased . In METF, costs of MP
are compatible with estimated values of standard community health workers in Myanmar, although the distribution
of these costs differs significantly (Fig. 2) .
New tools and approaches driving MP efficacy
In the 1950s, pioneering programmes in Latin America
and Southeast Asia relied on village-based volunteers to
collect blood smears of suspected cases. Since microscopy was the only diagnosis confirmation available, volunteers had to provide presumptive treatment or to refer
to a central or mobile microscopy-equipped facility for
diagnosis confirmation, resulting in delayed treatment
 . Populations living in remote areas were frequently
neglected. Today RDTs overcome many bottlenecks
encountered by microscopy: it is faster to train unskilled
personnel to use RDTs than to train a good microscopy
technician; there is no ‘fatigue’ or loss of blood smear
reading skills because of a rarity of positive cases in a
context of decreasing incidence; and, RDTs are easy to
supply . Recent systematic reviews have concluded that RDT interpretation and performance are satisfactory when handled by trained community members
and can result in the appropriate prescription of ACT for
confirmed P. falciparum cases . Recent improvements in RDT sensitivity and specificity mean that they
perform as well as microscopy for symptomatic falciparum malaria infections in many settings . RDTs can
reliably discriminate between P. falciparum and P. vivax
infections . The good performances achieved
by RDTs should be taken as strong encouragement to
further develop this tool. For example, it is crucial to
 
Landier et al. Malar J 15:363
work on the detection of P. falciparum parasites lacking PfHRP2. These parasites are of concern in South
America and should be monitored elsewhere to ensure
the sustained efficacy of the RDT in use . Additionally, it is important to improve the specifications of RDTs
so that results can remain readable over a longer time
period to facilitate monitoring of activities and quality
ACT and low‑dose primaquine
ACT rapidly kills asexual stage P. falciparum parasites,
preventing gametocytogenesis . Artemisinins
are also active against stages I–IV gametocytes but not
against the mature infectious gametocytes (stage V) . These forms develop in patients who present late
for treatment, making such patients important sources of
transmission . Primaquine is the only currently available anti-malarial active against mature P. falciparum
gametocytes . The single, low dose recommended
by WHO is unlikely to cause severe haemolytic anaemia
even in individuals with G6PD deficiency . When
administered early in the course of the disease in combination with an ACT it shows a dramatic effect on transmissibility of P. falciparum .
In many regions, the efficacy of malaria treatment is
threatened by the use of counterfeit or sub-standard
drugs . Widely available quality drugs limit the number of patients exposed to sub-therapeutic doses of antimalarials, contributing to the fight against the emergence
and the selection of drug-resistant parasites.
Trained and supported MP workers
Malaria post workers (MPW) should be members of the
community that they will serve, and should be selected by
their peers. They should have at least some basic education
and should have previously shown some interest in healthrelated work. MPWs must have an occupation that does
not require them to leave their village for more than a day
at a time. Their training should include an introduction to
malaria, the use of RDT and ACT, when to refer patients,
and the recording and reporting of their activities (Table 1).
In order to maintain an adequate standard of care, close

(METF). Drug and multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria is a major threat in the Thailand-Myanmar border region. In the past drug-resistant malaria
has emerged in this area, and other parts of Southeast Asia, and subsequently spread globally. Elimination of falciparum malaria in the region is
the only solution to avoid a repeat of history with artemisinin resistance. With this goal in mind, the METF was set up in 2014 and targets over 1200
villages in Eastern Kayin State, Myanmar . The high-level divisions (area, zone) are represented. Each zone corresponds to a territory under the
responsibility of one health community-based organization
 
Landier et al. Malar J 15:363
supervision and regular quality control of RDT results are
necessary, especially during the initial weeks and months
after an MP opening . This allows for retraining or
replacement of MPWs if necessary. MPWs should receive
fair compensation for their activities and constant availability . Community-based programmes often rely on
unpaid volunteers or provide activity-based compensation
(e.g., per consultation or per RDT) but these types of incentives are not adapted to a context of highly seasonal illness
or expected decreases in malaria incidence throughout an
effective elimination programme. While some individuals
may find it extremely rewarding to provide health services
to their community on a voluntary basis , remuneration of MPWs can promote objective-driven motivation
and drastically reduce attrition and corruption.
In some settings, private drug retailers might already
exist in a community. In a context of malaria elimination, provision of free EDT to rare malaria cases will not
represent a significant loss of income to such drug retailers. If they provide a valuable health service, it is desirable that this service should be monitored and quality
assured. As any other member of the community meeting
the requirements, they can be appointed as MPWs if they
agree to be trained and to follow MP principles.
Community engagement
Taking into account local context is crucial to setting up a
quality service that becomes a long-term part of community life . This observation is not new but increased
awareness that village-based EDT programmes will fail
unless there is acceptance and support from the population has led to the promotion of active engagement strategies . The community engagement (CE) team must
have a deep understanding of the local population and
develop and maintain trust with the community. They
should meet with the people, their leaders and representatives in order to explain the objectives, technicalities and
benefits of the MP. Unlike past attempts at communitybased malaria interventions, the MP can provide care to
uncomplicated malaria cases without delay or referral
 . Entrusting this responsibility to the community represents a significant step of empowerment especially for
vulnerable or marginalized populations.
Large‑scale deployment of community‑based EDT
for falciparum elimination
Evidence of the impact of the deployment
of community‑based EDT with ACT
Reports from a wide range of spatial and demographic
scales in various geographic settings describe downward
trends in clinical falciparum malaria incidence after the
deployment of EDT using ACT and RDTs over the last
15 years . Monitoring in settings where EDT has
been consistently available over long periods of time suggests that EDT in combination with vector control measures can achieve near-elimination of falciparum malaria.
Fig. 2  Distribution of monthly costs in an METF-supported MP.
Costs of METF MP are around US$160, similar to other programs
in Myanmar . The costs of training, transportation (supervision,
supply, patient referrals), data transmission (smartphone and SMS)
and management of the MP network (36 % of total), emphasize the
necessary investment on constant availability of supplies, regular
monitoring and weekly malaria surveillance in MP. Stock-outs, lack
of refresher trainings and/or monitoring visits have been reported as
major risks for losing the trust of the communities and demotivation
of workers in other programs of malaria EDT , and are a major
threat to elimination programs (see also “Challenges” section)

On the Thai-Myanmar border, 15 years of EDT with ACT
in clinics serving migrant and displaced populations drastically reduced the incidence of falciparum malaria .
Malaria elimination efforts in Thailand were largely effective for much of the central plains region of the Kingdom
but deteriorated with distance . Tak Province is an
example of a remote malarious region along the Thailand-
Myanmar border. In 2001–2002 a community-based EDT
strategy (The Tak Malaria Initiative) was deployed in all
five sub-districts of the province . In addition to the 92
existing provincial health facilities, 100 community-based
malaria treatment posts were set up in villages and areas
where access to health services was low. Over the following 2  years clinical P. falciparum incidence was reduced
by 54 %, malaria-related deaths by 52 % and P. falciparum
prevalence was significantly lower in intervention villages
in comparison to controls . Malaria vectors were still
present but the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) was
very low . In Asia, similar declines in morbidity and
mortality were reported from Cambodia after countrywide implementation . Reports of ACT deployment
on the African continent are equally encouraging: in the
quasi-experimental setting of Dielmo village in Senegal,
deployment of ACT at a local clinic in 2006 and mass
distribution of LLINs in 2008 impacted both P. falcipa‑
rum incidence and prevalence so drastically that in 2012
malaria was nearly eliminated . Deployment of community-based EDT was also followed by decreases in P.
falciparum-related morbidity, mortality and re-infection in
clinical trials . After regional implementation, similar decreases in incidence of morbidity and mortality were
observed in Kwazulu-Natal and a decreased prevalence
of P. falciparum infection was reported from Ethiopia .
Requirements for regional integration in an elimination
Even if a significant impact can be measured at village scale, the largest and longest term impacts towards
elimination can only be achieved if the MP programme
is deployed in all villages of a region (i.e., a geographical
unit defined by a population, political boundaries and
accessibility criteria). Coordination at regional (province, district, state) and central administrative levels of a
country offers a wide geographical spread, the ability to
take local specificities into account (different seasonality, for example) with relevant administrative divisions to
interface with the health system in place. It is, however,
advisable to always adapt divisions of a programme to
local constraints, especially in peripheries and on borders
where the population is usually less well covered.
Exhaustive
communities
region  Detailed data on the distribution of human settlements across malarious landscapes are frequently lacking making it difficult or impossible to know the true
malaria burden and or the healthcare needs. Systematic
geographic and demographic surveys are therefore a
prerequisite to acquire accurate baseline data. Prior to
the deployment of a network of MP, a detailed map of
all communities in the target region must be drawn with
geographic coordinates and estimated numbers of households for all settlements, the location of existing health
facilities and access to communication networks (Fig. 1).
This step is crucial to ensure that MPWs are deployed in
all human settlements and not according to perceived
access or other biased measures. It also allows for documentation of higher-level health structures on which the
MP support system can rely and to build a geographic
information system to follow the implementation of the
programme and its efficiency.
Malaria surveillance and  MP activity monitoring
through real‑time data reporting  Reporting of cases and
inventory is key for surveillance and logistics. Information
can be collected quickly on smartphones using dedicated
entry forms, and transmitted effortlessly through internet or SMS in regions where phone network is available
 . In regions lacking a phone network, paper data
sheets can be effectively collected and transported to central collection and data entry points. Weekly analysis of
malaria incidence reports allows identification of communities where falciparum malaria is not following the
expected decreasing trends. Spatio-temporal analysis of
weekly incidence reports allows regional-scale assessment of villages or clusters of villages where persisting or
higher-than-expected P. falciparum incidence is detected
and to adjust the magnitude of targeted interventions in
response . Analysis of weekly MP reports also provides alerts on possible MP malfunction or interruption
of service (missing reports, lack of activity, supply shortage, etc.), which is used to target supervision visits.
Integration within the regional health system network  In
many nations the health care system does not reach all
communities. The MP network is specifically designed
to address this critical gap, while avoiding redundancies.
If there are available healthcare units (e.g., health clinics), these can be used as focal points for MP located in
surrounding villages. They will be the referral centre for
patients that cannot be treated at MP. They can also act
as the last logistic node: dispatch MP supplies, collect and
transmit weekly data reports. The medical staff can supervise MPW activities. At higher levels, health districts and
sub-districts can handle the supervision of the network
(MPW training, MPW monitoring and supervision) and
its management (logistic, financial, administrative). Like-
 
Landier et al. Malar J 15:363
wise, data collection and surveillance tasks can be integrated within an existing health management information system (HMIS) if it is able to sustain the frequency of
reporting and timeliness required for malaria elimination
surveillance. Alternatively, a specific system can be set
up. As it is relying on high-resolution spatial and temporal data, it can easily be interfaced with existing reporting frameworks and can also become the backbone of a
future HMIS.
Challenges
Maintaining the MP and the network
The main challenges are to continuously maintain MP
supplies, to ensure regular collection of accurate and
complete data records and to monitor the activities
of MPWs and the quality of services, as was recently
described in studies of village health workers performing malaria EDT in Myanmar . Real-time, spatially explicit monitoring of activity and surveillance, as
described in the previous section, will only be relevant if
a strong organization with deep local roots and a dense
network is acting in the field to conduct routine activities and follow-up on alerts. This organization can merge
with and benefit from existing health structures where
possible. Community engagement at regional level will
involve coordination with community-based organizations, governmental and traditional authorities.
Vertical malaria-centred treatment is necessary to
properly address persistent falciparum malaria in places
where it has otherwise been difficult or impossible to
eliminate. Over 90 % of malaria resurgence events were
at least partly associated with failure to maintain malaria
control programme interventions . MPWs may lose
focus, motivation or become complacent when falciparum malaria cases become increasingly rare . MP will
remain at the centre of the elimination strategy in regions
where P. vivax is also present. In other areas it may be
necessary to switch to integrated community case management (ICCM) of additional diseases in order to retain
the focus on EDT for all potential malaria patients .
ICCM can increase public health relevance and cost
effectiveness of the MP in a malaria elimination setting,
where costs per case treated by an MP are expected to
rise as malaria cases decrease . ICCM represents
an additional step in community-based health provision
and new activities can benefit from training, supervision,
reporting, and logistic backbone already implemented for
malaria elimination.
P. falciparum drug resistance
Malaria has decreased several times before in history and
gains were lost when drug-resistant P. falciparum arose
 . The development of chloroquine resistance
in falciparum malaria and its subsequent spread globally inflicted a catastrophic blow to elimination efforts.
Collection of P. falciparum-positive RDTs or additional
collection of dried blood spots from all MP or from a
selection of sentinel sites, allows the monitoring of markers of resistance to artemisinin (K13 polymorphism)
as well as partner drugs (e.g., PfMDR1 for mefloquine/
lumefantrine) . Treatment and containment strategies can then be developed and implemented based on
the drug resistance surveillance network.
Vivax malaria
If complete malaria elimination is the goal, vivax malaria
must be eliminated in regions where it is prevalent. A different approach from that used for P. falciparum elimination is required because of differences in the life cycle of
the two parasites. A typical MP is only equipped to treat
the asexual blood stages of P. vivax. Plasmodium vivax
gametocytes emerge much earlier in the course of an
infection, sometimes prior to clinical presentation. EDT
is therefore not expected to be as efficient at breaking the
transmission cycle of P. vivax compared with P. falcipa‑
rum . Plasmodium vivax is characterized by liverstage hypnozoites which cause relapsing blood-stream
infections without exposure to new infective bites. These
hypnozoites are not killed by chloroquine and relapses
are therefore not prevented by early treatment at the MP
 . The only available treatment for the radical cure for
P. vivax is a 14-day course of primaquine but it is rarely
used because of poor adherence and potential toxicity
in case of G6PD deficiency . Point-of-care G6PD
tests and better treatments of the hypnozoites are needed
to eliminate P. vivax.
Conclusions
In the context of rising artemisinin- and multidrugresistance, significant gains can still be achieved by
making EDT available to everyone. The MP is a simple
structure relying on three equally crucial components
to provide EDT: RDTs, ACT+ primaquine, and trained
and paid MPWs originating from the community. Setting up, monitoring, supplying, and collecting activity
data from MP in the hardest-to-reach malaria endemic
areas represents a logistic and organizational challenge but will yield a major impact. A coordinated MP
network can be expected to trigger a regional rapid
decrease in falciparum malaria clinical case incidence
and prevalence, a highly desirable outcome in a malaria
elimination strategy. In addition to this generalized MP
coverage, elimination could be quickened by a limited
number of targeted interventions, such as mass-drug
administration and adapted vector control in high-risk
communities.
