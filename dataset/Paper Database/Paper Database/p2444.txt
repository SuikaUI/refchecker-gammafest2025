certain conditions the employment of a similar range of
thought, even if the former does not come before the mind
directly either in its methods or in its results. The boundless
domain of the effect of accumulated experience belongs here.
This effect results from the frequent conscious occurrence of
any condition or process, and consists in facilitating the occurrence and progress of similar processes. This effect is not
fettered by the condition that the factors constituting the experience shall return in toto to consciousness. This may incidentally be the case with a part of them; it must not happen to
a too great extent and with too great clearness, otherwise the
course of the present process will immediately be disturbed.
Most of these experiences remain concealed from consciousness and yet produce an effect which is significant and which
authenticates their previous existence.
Section 2. Memory in its Dependence
Along with this bare knowledge of the existence of memory
and its effects, there is abundant knowledge concerning the
conditions upon which depend the vitality of that inner survival
as well as the fidelity and promptness of the reproduction.
How differently do different individuals behave in this respect!
One retains and reproduces well; another, poorly. And not only
does this comparison hold good when different individuals
are compared with each other, but also when different phases
of the existence of the same individual are compared: morning and evening, youth and old age, find him different in this
Differences in the content of the thing to be reproduced are
of great influence. Melodies may become a source of torment
by the undesired persistency of their return. Forms and colors
are not so importunate; and if they do return, it is with noticeable loss of clearness and certainty. The musician writes for the
orchestra what his inner voice sings to him; the painter rarely
relies without disadvantage solely upon the images which his
inner eye presents to him; nature gives him his forms, study
governs his combinations of them. It is with something of a
struggle that past states of feeling are realized; when realized,
and this is often only through the instrumentality of the movements which accompanied them, they are but pale shadows of
themselves. Emotionally true singing is rarer than technically
correct singing.
If the two foregoing points of view are taken together – differences in individuals and differences in content – an endless
number of differences come to light. One individual overflows
with poetical reminiscences, another directs symphonies from
memory, while numbers and formulae, which come to a third
without effort, slip away from the other two as from a polished
Very great is the dependence of retention and reproduction
upon the intensity of the attention and interest which were
attached to the mental states the first time they were present.
Our Knowledge Concerning Memory
The language of life as well as of science in attributing a memory to the mind attempts to point out the facts and their interpretation somewhat as follows:
Mental states of every kind, – sensations, feelings, ideas, –
which were at one time present in consciousness and then
have disappeared from it, have not with their disappearance
absolutely ceased to exist. Although the inwardly-turned look
may no longer be able to find them, nevertheless they have not
been utterly destroyed and annulled, but in a certain manner
they continue to exist, stored up, so to speak, in the memory.
We cannot, of course, directly observe their present existence,
but it is revealed by the effects which come to our knowledge
with a certainty like that with which we infer the existence of
the stars below the horizon. These effects are of different kinds.
In a first group of cases we can call back into consciousness
by an exertion of the will directed to this purpose the seemingly lost states (or, indeed, in case these consisted in immediate sense-perceptions, we can recall their true memory images)
that is, we can reproduce them voluntarily. During attempts of
this sort, – that is, attempts to recollect – all sorts of images toward which our aim was not directed, accompany the desired
images to the light of consciousness. Often, indeed, the latter
entirely miss the goal, but as a general thing among the representations is found the one which we sought, and it is immediately recognised as something formerly experienced. It would
be absurd to suppose that our will has created it anew and, as
it were, out of nothing; it must have been present somehow
or somewhere. The will, so to speak, has only discovered it and
brought it to us again.
In a second group of cases this survival is even more striking.
Often, even after years, mental states once present in consciousness return to it with apparent spontaneity and without
any act of the will; that is, they are reproduced involuntarily.
Here, also, in the majority of cases we at once recognise the returned mental state as one that has already been experienced;
that is, we remember it. Under certain conditions, however,
this accompanying consciousness is lacking, and we know only
indirectly that the “now” must be identical with the “then”;
yet we receive in this way a no less valid proof for its existence
during the intervening time. As more exact observation teaches
us, the occurrence of these involuntary reproductions is not an
entirely random and accidental one. On the contrary they are
brought about through the instrumentality of other immediately present mental images. Moreover they occur in certain
regular ways which in general terms are described under the
so-called ‘laws of association.’
Finally there is a third and large group to be reckoned with
here. The vanished mental states give indubitable proof of their
continuing existence even if they themselves do not return to
consciousness at all, or at least not exactly at the given time.
Employment of a certain range of thought facilitates under

to the number of repetitions? How do these relations vary with
the greater or less intensity of the interest in the thing to be
reproduced? These and similar questions no one can answer.
This inability does not arise from a chance neglect of investigation of these relations. We cannot say that tomorrow,
or whenever we wish to take time, we can investigate these
problems. On the contrary this inability is inherent in the nature of the questions themselves. Although the conceptions in
question – namely, degrees of forgetfulness, of certainty and
interest – are quite correct, we have no means for establishing
such degrees in our experience except at the extremes, and
even then we cannot accurately limit those extremes. We feel
therefore that we are not at all in a condition to undertake
the investigation. We form certain conceptions during striking
experiences, but we cannot find any realisation of them in the
similar but less striking experiences of everyday life. Vice versa
there are probably many conceptions which we have not as
yet formed which would be serviceable and indispensable
for a clear understanding of the facts, and their theoretical
The amount of detailed information which an individual has at
his command and his theoretical elaborations of the same are
mutually dependent; they grow in and through each other. It
is because of the indefinite and little specialised character of
our knowledge that the theories concerning the processes of
memory, reproduction, and association have been up to the
present time of so little value for a proper comprehension of
those processes. For example, to express our ideas concerning their physical basis we use different metaphors-stored up
ideas, engraved images, well-beaten paths. There is only one
thing certain about these figures of speech and that is that they
are not suitable.
Of course the existence of all these deficiencies has its perfectly
sufficient basis in the extraordinary difficulty and complexity
of the matter. It remains to be proved whether, in spite of the
clearest insight into the inadequacy of our knowledge, we shall
ever make any actual progress. Perhaps we shall always have to
be resigned to this. But a somewhat greater accessibility than
has so far been realised in this field cannot be denied to it, as
I hope to prove presently. If by any chance a way to a deeper
penetration into this matter should present itself, surely, considering the significance of memory for all mental phenomena,
it should be our wish to enter that path at once. For at the very
worst we should prefer to see resignation arise from the failure
of earnest investigations rather than from persistent, helpless
astonishment in the face of their difficulties.
The burnt child shuns the fire, and the dog which has been
beaten runs from the whip, after a single vivid experience. People in whom we are interested we may see daily and yet not be
able to recall the color of their hair or of their eyes.
Under ordinary circumstances, indeed, frequent repetitions are
indispensable in order to make possible the reproduction of
a given content. Vocabularies, discourses, and poems of any
length cannot be learned by a single repetition even with the
greatest concentration of attention on the part of an individual
of very great ability. By a sufficient number of repetitions their
final mastery is ensured, and by additional later reproductions
gain in assurance and ease is secured.
Left to itself every mental content gradually loses its capacity
for being revived, or at least suffers loss in this regard under
the influence of time. Facts crammed at examination time soon
vanish, if they were not sufficiently grounded by other study
and later subjected to a sufficient review. But even a thing so
early and deeply founded as one’s mother tongue is noticeably
impaired if not used for several years.
Section 3. Deficiencies in our Knowledge concerning Memory
The foregoing sketch of our knowledge concerning memory
makes no claim to completeness. To it might be added such a
series of propositions known to psychology as the following:
“He who learns quickly also forgets quickly,” “Relatively long
series of ideas are retained better than relatively short ones,”
Old people forget most quickly the things they learned last,”
and the like. Psychology is wont to make the picture rich with
anecdote and illustration. But – and this is the main point –
even if we particularise our knowledge by a most extended use
of illustrative material, everything that we can say retains the
indefinite, general, and comparative character of the propositions quoted above. Our information comes almost exclusively
from the observation of extreme and especially striking cases.
We are able to describe these quite correctly in a general way
and in vague expressions of more or less. We suppose, again
quite correctly, that the same influences exert themselves, although in a less degree, in the case of the inconspicuous, but
a thousand-fold more frequent, daily activities of memory. But
if our curiosity carries us further and we crave more specific
and dependencies, both those already mentioned and others, –
if we put questions, so to speak, concerning their inner structure – our answer is silence. How does the disappearance of
the ability to reproduce, forgetfulness, depend upon the length
of time during which no repetitions have taken place? What
proportion does the increase in certainty of reproduction bear
