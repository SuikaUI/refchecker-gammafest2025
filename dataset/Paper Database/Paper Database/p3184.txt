ABSTRACT Spontaneous rupture of ovarian endometriomas (OEs) may cause serious injury to patients.
However, in traditional clinical diagnosis, it is vulnerable to be ignored or misdiagnosed for the symptoms of
the acute abdomen caused by it are quite similar to those of some common gynecological emergencies, which
leads to serious complications to patients. In view of this, this study investigates the AI-enabled, early and
accurate diagnosis of spontaneous rupture of OEs. Although artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has been proved to be
a powerful tool to help to make accurate clinical diagnosis, however, as far as we know, there is so far no report
on AI-enabled diagnosis of spontaneous rupture of OEs yet. Speciﬁcally, this study proposes a particle swarm
optimization (PSO) enhanced random forest (RF) classiﬁcation model, called PSO-RF, to make diagnosis,
where RF is used to rank feature importance and make diagnosis considering that an OE is ruptured or not
is a typical 0-1 classiﬁcation problem, and PSO is leveraged to ﬁne-tune the essential parameters of RF. The
performance of the proposed PSO-RF model is evaluated with practical data collected from a local hospital
and fully benchmarked by comparing with eight other machine learning models whose key parameters are
sufﬁciently optimized as well by grid search or PSO, for the sake of fairness. The experiment results show that
the proposed PSO-RF model outperforms all the other models, with the accuracy of 97.47%, the area under
the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.996, the sensitivity of 94.12% and the speciﬁcity of 98.39%. It can be concluded
that the PSO-RF model is a highly effective AI-enabled tool for preoperatively diagnosing spontaneous
rupture of OEs.

I. INTRODUCTION
Ovarian endometrioma is a kind of endometriosis, patients
of which have ectopic endometrial tissues in ovary and
suffer from various clinical symptoms including pelvic pain,
irregular menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrheal, dyspareunia
and infertility . It is one of the most common diseases in
reproductive women aging from 25 to 45 years old, with a
high incidence of 10%-15% . Although ovarian endometrioma is a common benign disease, the size of the cyst typically
increases gradually, and with a small probability, spontaneous

rupture of cyst may occur during or after menstruation ,
 . If the rupture can not be diagnosed and treated correctly
in time, the severe cases may cause massive hemorrhage
in the abdominal cavity, leading to hemorrhagic shock .
However, the symptoms of the acute abdomen caused by
spontaneous rupture of ovarian endometrioma are similar
to those of ectopic pregnancy, rupture and hemorrhage of
corpus luteum, torsion of ovarian cyst pedicle and appendicitis , . Consequently, it is vulnerable to be ignored or
misdiagnosed clinically which causes serious complications
to patients. Early and accurate diagnosis the spontaneous
rupture of ovarian endometrioma could signiﬁcantly help to
avoid serious injury.

Considering the high misdiagnosis of spontaneous rupture
of ovarian endometrimas, researches on it has been widely
carried out. Some of them have tried to ﬁnd suitable biomarkers to assist diagnosis of rupture of ovarian endometrimas
preoperatively and have reported that spontaneous rupture
of ovarian endometrimas are typically accompanied by high
levels of serum CA125 and CA19-9 , , – . In
particular, Xinyu Dai et al. have evaluated the clinical signiﬁcance of serum CA125 and CA19-9 in the patients with
spontaneous rupture of ovarian endometromas by statistical methods . The results have shown that the levels of
CA125 and CA19-9 in patients with spontaneous rupture
of ovarian endometromas increased signiﬁcantly. Currently,
it is believed that the combined biomarkers of CA125 and
CA19-9 is helpful for the early diagnosis of spontaneous
rupture of ovarian endometriomas.
In the other hand, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), especially
machine learning (ML), has been widely used in medical diagnosis . The innovative AI-enabled methods are
important assistances in precision medicine, which may help
to make accurate clinical diagnosis at low cost and early.

leveraging
Kawakami et al. have developed an ovarian cancer-speciﬁc
predictive framework for clinical stage, histotype, residual
tumor burden, and prognosis based on multiple biomarkers
 . The results have revealed that AI-enabled models can
provide accurate diagnoses and prognostic predictions for
patients with epithelial ovarian cancer prior to initial intervention. In , an optimized random forest (RF) classiﬁer
has been used to detect nodules inside the lungs. In ,
Y. Shi et. al have proposed a hybrid QPSO-RF (Quantum
particle swarm optimization - RF) model to predict the
disease progression of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis using
Computed Tomography (CT). Speciﬁcally, QPSO algorithm
has been used to search the optimal feature subsets and RF has
been used for classiﬁcation. In , four machine learning
algorithms, namely support vector machine (SVM), partial
least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), RF, and logistic regression (LR), have been applied to develop the model
for identifying metabolomic biomarkers in cervicovaginal
ﬂuid for EC detection. Pergialiotis et al. have investigated
the diagnostic accuracy of three different machine learning
algorithms, i.e. LR, artiﬁcial neural networks and classiﬁcation and regression trees (CARTs) for the prediction of
endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding or endometrial thickness ≥5 mm, as determined by ultrasound examination . E. Pashaei et al.
have proposed a binary version of black hole algorithm for
solving feature selection problem in biological data .
A novel one-dimensional deep densely connected neural
network (DDNN) has been constructed in to detect
atrial ﬁbrillation in 12-lead electrocardiogram waveforms.
The proposed model has been proved to be sufﬁciently
effective to be applied to clinical diagnosis of atrial ﬁbrillation. In the study of Obrzut et al., the usefulness of six
AI-enabled methods have been evaluated for 5-year overall
survival prediction in patients with cervical cancer treated
by radical hysterectomy . It has demonstrated that the
best model, namely the probabilistic neural network model,
achieves a high prediction accuracy of 0.892 and sensitivity
Machine learning models have also been used in the
diagnosis of endometrial tumor related diseases. In , decision trees have been used to analyze the effectiveness of treatment of patients with recurrent pelvic cyst who underwent
surgical intervention. The study of Günakan has constructed
a naive Bayes model to make predictions of lymph node
involvement in endometrial cancer . In , automated
image analysis and RF models have been used to classify
normal, premalignant, and malignant endometrial tissues.
However, as far as we known, no study on ML-enabled
diagnostics of spontaneous rupture of ovarian endometriomas
has been reported so far.
Inspired by the above observations, this paper proposes
a machine learning model to make accurate diagnosis of
spontaneous rupture of ovarian endometriomas preoperatively. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst model the problem of cyst rupture as a 0-1 classiﬁcation problem. Practical physiological
data involving plenty of features are collected from women
with ovarian endometriomas who have treated in the First
Afﬁliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University between
2006 and 2017. Considering the effectiveness of random forest algorithm in feature selection and classiﬁcation and
therefore it has been widely used to make intelligent medical
diagnoses – , , , we design a random forest
model to rank the importance of different features and further
solve the 0-1 classiﬁcation problem. In order to improve the
performance of random forest model, we further leverage
particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize
the parameters of the random forest model. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time to adopt the machine learning
technique in the diagnosis of spontaneous rupture of ovarian
endometriomas.
The proposed PSO enhanced RF model, PSO-RF for
short, is comprehensively benchmarked by comparing
with other ﬁne-tuned machine learning models, including
the gridsearch optimized random forest model (GO-RF),
the naive Bayesian classiﬁcation model (NBC), the gridsearch optimized k-nearest neighbor model (GO-KNN),
the PSO enhanced KNN (PSO-KNN), the gridsearch optimized lightGBM model (GO-lightGBM), the PSO
enhanced lightGBM model (PSO-lightGBM), the gridsearch
optimized logical regression model (GO-LR), and the
PSO enhanced logical regression model (PSO-LR). The
results show that the PSO-RF model outperforms all the other
models, with the accuracy of 95.57%, the area under the
ROC curve (AUC) of 0.996, the sensitivity of 94.12% and
the speciﬁcity of 98.39%.

TABLE 1. Baseline characteristics of endometriosis patients.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The
methodology of the proposed PSO-RF is given in detail in
Section II. Section III presents the experimental veriﬁcation
and analysis. Finally, Section IV concludes the paper and
proposes the future work.
II. METHODS
A. DATA ACQUISITION AND PREPROCESSING
Physiological data were collected by complete blood counts,
laparoscopic surgery and laparotomy from premenopausal
female patients with ovarian endometriomas. The dataset
includes 193 records where 53 patients have been diagnosed with spontaneous ruptured ovarian endometriomas
and 140 patients with unruptured ovarian endometriomas.
Each sample in the dataset includes the age, the leukocyte
count and the physiological features obtained by laparoscopic surgery or laparotomy, such as the carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA) level, the CA125 level, the alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level, the CA19-9 level, the position of the ovarian
endometrioma, the endometrioma stage1 and the size of the
ovarian endometrioma, as shown in Table 1. All the data have
been normalized by x∗=
The dataset has been divided into the training set and the
test set by repeated random sampling until the P values with
respect to all the features between the two sets are greater
than 0.2. This results in a division of 114 patients in the
training set (32 patients with ruptured ovarian endometriomas
and 82 patients with unruptured ovarian endometriomas in
the training set) and 79 patients in the test set (21 patients
with ruptured ovarian endometriomas and 58 patients with
unruptured ovarian endometriomas), as listed in Table 1.
1These patients were classiﬁed into four stages according to the revised
classiﬁcation made by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine
FIGURE 1. Structure of a RF model.
B. RANDOM FOREST MODEL
Random forest (RF) is an ensemble learning model for
classiﬁcation and regression. RF runs efﬁciently on large
data bases, seldom overﬁts, and has the ability of giving
estimates of which features are important in the classiﬁcation.
In particular, RF is able to achieve a good accuracy rate for
the classiﬁcation of discrete high-dimensional datasets. With
this in mind, in this work, RF is leveraged to diagnose the
spontaneous rupture of ovarian endometriomas.
The RF model consists of multiple classiﬁcation and
regression trees (CARTs) . Each CART is a binary decision tree that is grown by recursively partitioning the data in
a parent node into child nodes. The structure of the RF model
is shown in Fig. 1.
1) SAMPLING AND SPLITTING
The overall samples in the training set are further divided
into two parts. Speciﬁcally, 60% of the samples are used
to train the CARTs, the set of which is denoted as D =
{s1, s2, . . . , s|D|} where si, i
1, 2, . . . , |D| is the ith
VOLUME 8, 2020
M. Zhou et al.: AI-Enabled Diagnosis of Spontaneous Rupture of Ovarian Endometriomas: A PSO Enhanced Random Forest Approach
multi-dimensional sample in D. The rest are the pretest samples used to measure the classiﬁcation accuracy rate of this
CARTs, the set of which is denoted as ˆD = {ˆs1, ˆs2, . . . , ˆs| ˆD|}
where ˆsi, i
1, 2, . . . , | ˆD| is the ith multi-dimensional
sample in ˆD.
Each CART is grown with a bootstrap sample set which
is taken by randomly sampling with replacement from D.
Concretely, one sample is randomly drawn from D as a training sample at a time, and then, this sample is put back. This
process of sampling with replacement is repeated m times so
that to generate a new sample set with the same size as D.
The new created sample set is then used as the root, e.g. the
training set of a CART, denoted as Ri, i = 1, . . . , NT , where
NT is the number of CATRs in RF. Apparently, in this way,
some samples may appear multiple times in the new training
set, while others, namely about 36.8%2 of the samples in the
original dataset, may never appear. Therefore, the samples
that do not appear in the new dataset are taken as the test set.
The training set of each CART will be split as a binary
tree. Let NF be the number of features of each sample. At
each node of the decision tree, randomly select Nf , Nf ≪NF
features for splitting. In the other words, at each node,
the splitting feature is selected among a random subset of the
original set of features. This randomness further enhances the
generalization of RF model.
The criteria of splitting in this work is the Gini index
of impurity. Formally, denote the sample set at node t as
St = {st,1, . . . , st,|St|} where st,i = {ft,i,1, . . . , ft,i,NF } is the
ith sample in node t and ft,i,j is the value of the jth feature in
st,i. The class assignment of st,i is denoted as Ct,i ∈{−1, 1}
where -1 indicates an unruptured ovarian endometrioma and
1 indicates a ruptured ovarian endometrioma. The Gini index
at node t is given by
pk|t(1 −pk|t),
where pk|t is the probability of class k estimated from the
samples in node t, e.g.
At each step in the algorithm, the node t is split at the
feature j and value ft,j into a pair of child nodes, denoted as
tL = {x ∈t|xj ≤ft,j} and tR = {x ∈t|xj > ft,j}, respectively,
where j and ft,j are determined by
1Gt|j,ft,j,
1Gt|j,ft,j =
 Gt −pL|tGL|t −pR|tGR|t
2Assuming there are m samples in the original data set, the probability
of each sample being selected is 1/m, and the probability of a sample
not being selected in all of the m sampling is (1 −1/m)m. Moreover,
limm→∞(1 −1/m)m = e−1 ≈0.368
pL|t and pR|t are the probabilities of assigning a sample to the
left child and right child, respectively.
The process of splitting repeats until the terminal condition
is satisﬁed, that is, 1) the depth of the CART reaches the
predeﬁned maximum value dmax, or 2) |St| is less than the
predeﬁned minimum value Ns,min. In this way, a CART
is formed. The set of the CARTs in RF is denoted as
T = {T1, . . . , TNT }.
Finally, all the CARTs involved in a RF cast votes for their
inputs, after which RF aggregates their results and determines
the output by majority voting of the CARTs. Taking in consideration the different classiﬁcation abilities of CARTs in RF
model, in this work, the voting weight of each CART is set
separately according to its classiﬁcation accuracy. In essence,
after the training, the weight of each CART is estimated by
the pretest samples in ˆD as follows:
wTi = N correct
, i = 1, 2, . . . , NT ,
where N correct
is the number of samples classiﬁed correctly
The voting strategy is to summarize the classiﬁcation
results of all the CARTs, and then take the weighted mode of
the classiﬁcations as the ﬁnal classiﬁcation results as follows:
Csi = arg max
 Csi | Ti = k
where Csi|Ti is the classiﬁcation result of feature si made by
In summary, the procedure of random forest model is
shown in Algorithm 1.
3) FEATURE IMPORTANCE
One of the most attractive advantages of RF is that it gives
estimates of what features are important in the classiﬁcation.
There are many biomarkers and factors associated with the
rupture of ovarian endometriomas among which some may
have very weak correlation with it. So, it will be of great
signiﬁcance to rank the importance of all the features to eliminate irrelevant or weak correlated features, so as to reduce
the complexity of RF model and improve the accuracy of the
RF uses Gini index to evaluate the importance of a feature.
Speciﬁcally, the importance of feature j to node t of Ti,
denoted as V im
j,t,i, is evaluated as follows.
j,t,i = max
1Gj,t,i|ft,j.
Let Mj,i be the set of nodes where feature j is included in Ti.
The importance of feature j to Ti can be calculated as
Further, the importance of feature j to RF model is

C. PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION BASED ON PSO
Generally, in RF, some parameters such as the maximum
depth of a CART (dmax), the minimum number of samples in a
node (Ns,min) and the number of CARTs (NT ), etc., need to be
tune for achieving the optimal performance of RF. A feasible
solution is to ﬁne-tune these parameters by an appropriate
optimization algorithm, such as various heuristic algorithms.
In this study, we leverage particle swarm optimization ,
which is a metaheuristic algorithm simulating the behavior of
birds catching food, to tune the essential parameters of the RF
model to further improve the accuracy. The essence of PSO
is to use the current position, global extremum and individual
extremum information to guide the next iteration position of
particles, which enables it to approach the optimal solution
with a fast convergence speed, and hence effectively optimize
the parameters of the model , . Another signiﬁcant
advantage of PSO is that it can adjust the maximum step size
at each iteration, making it possible to ﬁnd an approximate
optimal solution in a wide range of possible parameters
 . In addition, PSO has some attractive features, such as
easy to implement, less parameters, computationally cheap
and so on.
PSO searches the optimal solution through agents, or called
particles. A large number of particles form a swarm.
A particle i is characterized by its location vector Li and
velocity vector vi which are updated iteratively by
Li(t + 1) = Li(t) + vi(t + 1),
vi(t + 1) = wivi(t) + c1r1
 Li,best −Li(t)
 Lgbest −Li(t)
where wi is the selected weighting factor for particle i,
Li,best is the location at which particle i previously had the
best ﬁtness measure, Lgbest is the global optimal location
of the whole swarm, c1 and c2 are the cognitive acceleration constant and the social acceleration constant, respectively, generally with the value of 2, and r1 and r2 are two
random parameters within the range . The iteration
terminates if 1) reach the maximum number of iterations,
or 2) convergence is reached based on the ﬁtness measure.
In summary, the procedure of the proposed PSO-RF is as
S1 Determine the parameters of PSO, including the
maximum number of iterations, the maximum speed of
particles and the search space, i.e., the feasible region of
solutions.
S2 Randomly generate a swarm where each particle is a
three dimensional vector {dmax, Ns,min, NT }. The size of
the swarm is denoted as NPSO.
S3 Start PSO iteration procedure to obtain the optimal dmax,
Ns,min and NT .
S3.1 For each particle in the swarm, perform the RF
algorithm deﬁned in Algorithm 1 to evaluate the
ﬁtness, i.e., the diagnostic accuracy.
S3.2 For each particle i, i
∈{1, 2, . . . , NPSO} in the
swarm, compare the particle’s current ﬁtness with
the ﬁtness of Li,best. If the current location ﬁts
better, then replace Li,best with the current location.
S3.3 Update Lgbest if the new global optimal location of
the current swarm ﬁts better.
S3.4 For each particle i, i
∈{1, 2, . . . , NPSO} in the
swarm, update vi and Li by Eq.(12) and Eq.(11).
S3.5 Repeat S3.1 - S3.4 until convergence is reached.
S4 Perform the RF algorithm deﬁned in Algorithm 1 with
the optimal dmax, Ns,min and NT obtained in Step S3 to
make diagnosis.
The Pseudo code and the ﬂow diagram of the PSO-RF
procedure are shown in Algorithm 2 and Fig. 2, respectively.

A. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
1) ACCURACY
Diagnosis of spontaneous rupture of ovarian endometrioma
is a typical binary classiﬁcation problem, in which the
diagnosis results are labeled either as positive (P), indicating a ruptured ovarian endometrioma, or negative (N),
indicating an unruptured ovarian endometrioma. There are
four possible combinations of the diagnosis results and the
actuality, namely TP, FP, TN and FN which are explained as
• TP: both the diagnosis result and the actuality are P.
• FP: the diagnosis result is p and the actuality is N.
• TN: both the diagnosis result and the actuality are N.
• FN: the diagnosis result is n and the actuality is P.

2) SENSITIVITY & SPECIFICITY
Besides accuracy rate, sensitivity and speciﬁcity are also used
to measure the effectiveness of PSO-RF model. Sensitivity,
also known as true-positive rate (TPR), is used to measure
the ability of correctly identifying the cases with ruptured
ovarian endometriomas, whereas speciﬁcity, also known as
true-negative rate (TNR), is used to measure the ability of the
identifying those without the disease. The higher the sensitivity or the speciﬁcity is, the more effective the model is.
Sensitivity (TPR) and speciﬁcity (TNR) can be calculated by
TP + FN = TP
FP + TN = TN
respectively.
3) ROC AND AUC
Moreover, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC)
is used to illustrate the diagnostic ability of the PSO-RF.
ROC is a comprehensive indicator that is capable of evaluating TPR and false-positive rate (FPR) at various thresholds.
It is a two-dimensional graph in which TPR is plotted on
the Y axis and FPR is plotted on the X axis. FPR can be
calculated by
FP + TN = FP
N = 1 −TNR.
The AUC (area under the curve) is a concomitant of ROC
obtained by calculating the area under the ROC. AUC tells
how much the model is capable of distinguishing between
ruptured and unruptured ovarian endometriomas. Higher the
AUC, better the model is at predicting positives as positives
and negatives as negatives.
B. RESULTS
1) FEATURE SELECTION
The ranking of the feature importance for diagnosing the
rupture of ovarian endometriomas derived by PSO-RF is
shown in Fig. 3. The P values and the Pearson correlation
coefﬁcients (PCC) for the features related to the rupture of
OE are listed in Table 3.
It can be observed the ranking obtained by PSO-RF
is on the whole consistent with those obtained by statistical analyses. The level of CA19-9 and CA125 are
the top two important biomarkers, with the normalized
importance of 0.316 and 0.273, respectively, the P values
of 4.08 × 10−11 and 2.47 × 10−14, respectively, and the PPC
values of 0.4522 and 0.5128, respectively. This conclusion is
consistent with the clinical experience. Serum CA19-9 and
CA125, tumor associated antigens, have been used clinically to identify the recurrence and severity of endometriosis.
The endometrioma cyst ﬂuid was suspected to be rich of
biomarkers such as CA19-9 and CA125. However, in normal conditions, the large CA19-9 and CA125 glycoprotein
FIGURE 3. Ranking of the importance of features of ovarian
endometriomas.
TABLE 3. Association of ruptured/unruptured OEs with clinicopathologic
molecules were preventing by the thick wall of endometrioma
cyst from entering the peripheral circulation. The spontaneous rupture of the OE may lead the biomarkers into the
blood circulation, resulting the high elevation of the CA19-9
and CA125 in the serum . The level of CEA, with the
normalized importance of 0.231, P value of 7.35×10−11, and
PCC value of -0.4468, is the third important biomarker. The
leukocytes count and AFP level are also signiﬁcant biomarkers, however, are less important than CA19-9, CA125 and
In order to investigate the optimal combinations of features
to be input into the PSO-RF model, the effectiveness of any
single feature and various feature combinations on diagnosis
of ruptured ovarian endometriomas is evaluated. Speciﬁcally,
Fig. 4 plots the ROC curves and the corresponding AUC
values of the classiﬁcation results derived from PSO-RF
using a single feature. Not surprisingly, CA19-9, CA125 and
CEA output the most effective results, with the values of
AUC of 0.948, 0.902 and 0.819, respectively. In addition,
although the importance of the Leukocyte level is a bit
higher than that of the AFP level, the AUC value of AFP
level (0.806) is much greater than that of Leukocyte level
(0.725). The ROC Curves, AUC values and accuracy rates
of classiﬁcations using various features combinations derived
from PSO-RF are depicted in Fig. 4(b). It can be seen that
the best performance is achieved in the case of inputting

the following four features: CA19-9 level, CA125 level,
leukocyte count and AFP level, with the AUC of 0.996 and
the accuracy of 97.47%. The feature combination of CA19-9
level, CA125 level, leukocyte count, AFP level and CEA level
also results in the same high accuracy of 97.47%, however,
the AUC value is a bit lower, with the value of 0.99.
The box and jitter plots representing the distributions of
the selected four features for PSO-RF-based classiﬁcation
of ruptured and unruptured OEs are shown in Fig. 5. It can
be observed that the distributions are signiﬁcantly different
between the ruptured and unruptured OEs. The levels of
CA19-9, CA125, leukocyte count and AFP of the patients
with ruptured OEs are all signiﬁcantly higher than those of
patients with unruptured OEs.

PSO-lightGBM, PSO-LR and PSO-KNN, and the NBC
model. The parameters obtained by grid search are shown
in Table 2. NBC model has no parameter tuning for there is
no parameter to be ﬁne-tuned in it.
Table 4 summarizes the performance of all the nine
models, including the classiﬁcation accuracy rates, the sensitivity and the speciﬁcity. Besides the performance results
obtained from the dataset fragmentation shown in Table 1,
Table. 4 also lists the accuracy rates obtained by holdout cross-validations (40% holdout samples, 100 times) and
10-fold cross-validations, respectively, to evaluate the performance more comprehensively. The distributions of the
cross-validation results are presented as box plots, as shown
in Fig. 6. For each test in the 40% holdout cross-validations,
the dataset is divided into a training set and a test set by
repeated random sampling until the P values with respect
to all the four features between the two sets are greater
than 0.2 to ensure that there is no signiﬁcant correlation
between the samples of the two sets. As to the 10-fold
cross-validations, the P values are not guaranteed to be greater

FIGURE 6. Box plots of cross-validations.
It can be observed that the performances of PSO-RF in
both cross-validations are the highest. Speciﬁcally, for 40%
holdout cross-validations, PSO-RF achieves the highest average accuracy rate of 95.47%, with the minimum standard
deviation (S.D.) of 1.36%. The red box of PSO-RF in Fig. 6
is the highest one, and also the narrowest one, with an
interquartile range (IQR) of 1.27% and a min-max range
of 7.59%. PSO-RF also performs the best in the 10-fold
cross-validations, with the highest average accuracy rate
of 92.84%. The GO-RF model and the PSO-lightGBM model
also achieve high average accuracy rates, i.e., 93.58% and
93.68% in 40% holdout cross-validations, and 91.26% and
92.54% in 10-fold cross-validations, respectively.
Table 4 also shows that PSO does improve the performance
of these models. It slightly improves the accuracy rates of
the RF model, the lightGBM model, the LR model and the
KNN model by 1.89%, 2.13%, 1.52% and 1.01%, respectively, in the 40% holdout cross-validations, and 1.58%,
0.97%, 2.53% and 0.47%, respectively, in the 10-fold crossvalidations. The reason why the performance improvements
are limited is that the parameters of the original models
have also been optimized by grid search. However, the time
complexity of PSO is O(NiterNPSO log NPSO) where Niter is
the number of iterations and NPSO is the size of the swarm.
Whereas that of the gridsearch approach is O
ni, i = 1, 2, . . . , j is number of potential values of feature i
and j is the number of features to be ﬁne-tuned, which is much
higher than that of PSO.
The superiority of the PSO-RF model is also presented
in Fig. 7 where the ROCs of these models are plotted. It can
be observed intuitively that the curve of PSO-RF is the closest
one to the upper left corner (AUC = 0.996), implying that it
outperforms all the others for its highest the overall accuracy.
The ROCs of the PSO-lightGBM model and the GO-RF
model are also quite closer to the upper left corner, with
slightly lower AUC values, i.e., 0.996 for the PSO-lightGBM
model and 0.995 for GO-RF model, respectively.
The confusion matrices of the PSO-RF model and the
benchmark models are shown in Fig. 8. PSO-RF performs
pretty well. There is only one false positive case and one
false negative case, respectively. By contrast, one false negative and two false positives are made by the GO-RF model
and the PSO-lightGBM model. The PSO-LR model, the
GO-lightGBM model and the NBC model recognize all the
patients with unruptured ovarian endometriomas, however,
make three, four and ﬁve false positives, respectively. In
addition, the PSO-KNN model makes two false positives and
two false negatives, the GO-LR makes one false negative
and four false positives, whereas the GO-KNN model makes
four false negatives and two false positives, all of which are
inferior to the proposed PSO-RF model.
In addition to the classiﬁcation accuracy, the efﬁciency
of these classiﬁers is also evaluated. For PSO enhanced
models, the convergence performances are evaluated since
they train the models iteratively to approach the sub-optimal
solutions. Fig. 9 shows the comparisons of the convergence

performance among PSO enhanced models. The ﬁtness
of all the algorithm is the accuracy rate. It can be
observed that the accuracy rate of the PSO-RF model gradually rises in the beginning (within 80 iterations). Then
it converges to the stable value of 97.47%. The other
three PSO enhanced models, namely the PSO-LR model,
the PSO-KNN model and the PSO-lightGBM model converge after the 120th iteration, moreover, with lower accuracy
Fig. 9 only presents the convergence performance along
with iterations. However, the time complexities per iteration
of difference models vary greatly. In view of this, next,
we evaluate the per iteration time complexities of these models. Considering that RF, lightGBM, KNN, NBC and LR are
not iterative algorithms, the CPU time required to train a
model and then to make a classiﬁcation are measured instead
of the convergence rate. The results averaged from 100 tests
are shown in Fig. 9(b), where it can be observed that the CPU
time needed by RF is the longest. The reason is that the time
complexity of RF is O(NT dmax · mn), that is, it is determined
not only by the number of samples (m) and the number of
features (n), but also by the number of CARTs (NT ) and the
depth of a CART (dmax). As a contrast, the time complexity
of LR is only O(mn); that of NBC is O(cmn) where c is the
number of classes; that of KNN is O(kmn) where k is the
number of neighbors; and the time complexity of lightGBM
is co-determined by the procedures of gradient-based oneside sampling and exclusive feature bundling, with the time
complexities of O(lmn) and O(lmnb), respectively, where l
is the number of leaves and nb
≫n is the number of
bundles. Speciﬁcally, in this work, NT = 94, dmax = 2,
c = 2, k = 7 and l = 9, so that NT · dmax ≫k, l, 2, 1,
results in a much longer CPU time of RF than those of other
models. Nevertheless, about 0.2 second CPU time training
and classiﬁcation can fully satisfy the requirements of the
classiﬁcation system.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
Spontaneous rupture of OE is vulnerable to be ignored or
misdiagnosed clinically, which may probably lead to serious
complications to patients. In this work, we proposed a PSO
enhanced RF model, namely PSO-RF, to assist in the preoperative diagnosis of spontaneous rupture of ovarian endometriomas. As far as we know, it is the ﬁrst work on ML-enabled
diagnostics of spontaneous rupture of OEs. The data used in
this work were collected by complete blood counts, laparoscopic surgery and laparotomy from premenopausal female
patients with ovarian endometriomas who have treated in
the First Afﬁliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University.
We ﬁrst leveraged the RF model to rank the importance
of the features and select the proper feature combination.
Then, we employed PSO to ﬁne-tune the essential parameters of the RF model to further improve the diagnosis
The PSO-RF model was comprehensively benchmarked
by comparing with other machine learning models, including
three PSO enhanced models and ﬁve gridsearch-optimized
models. The results showed that the PSO-RF model outperforms all the other models in accuracy, with the accuracy
of 97.47%, the AUC value of 0.996, the sensitivity of 94.12%
and the speciﬁcity of 98.39%, due to the excellent classi-
ﬁcation ability of RF and parameter tuning based on PSO.
Although the PSO-RF model costs the highest time complexity, the overall complexity is totally acceptable practically.
Our work concludes that the PSO-RF model is a highly
effective AI-enabled tool for diagnose spontaneous rupture of
ovarian endometriomas. It is fully qualiﬁed to assist surgeons
in diagnosing whether a patient’s ovarian endometrioma is
ruptured preoperatively.
