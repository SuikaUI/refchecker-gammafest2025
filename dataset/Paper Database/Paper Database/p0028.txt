To Barbara Amato
A more accurate title for this book might be: An Exposition of Selected
Parts of Empirical Process Theory, With Related Interesting Facts About
Weak Convergence, and Applications to Mathematical Statistics. The high
points are Chapters II and VII, which describe some of the developments
inspired by Richard Dudley's 1978 paper. There I explain the combinatorial
ideas and approximation methods that are needed to prove maximal
inequalities for empirical processes indexed by classes of sets or classes of
functions. The material is somewhat arbitrarily divided into results used to
prove consistency theorems and results used to prove central limit theorems.
This has allowed me to put the easier material in Chapter II, with the hope of
enticing the casual reader to delve deeper.
Chapters III through VI deal with more classical material, as seen from a
different perspective. The novelties are: convergence for measures that don't
live on borel a-fields; the joys of working with the uniform metric on
D[O, IJ; and finite-dimensional approximation as the unifying idea behind
weak convergence. Uniform tightness reappears in disguise as a condition
that justifies the finite-dimensional approximation. Only later is it exploited
as a method for proving the existence of limit distributions.
The last chapter has a heuristic flavor. I didn't want to confuse the
martingale issues with the martingale facts.
My introduction to empirical processes came during my 1977-8 stay with
Peter Gaenssler and Winfried Stute at the Ruhr University in Bochum,
while I was supported by an Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship. Peter
and I both spent part of 1982 at the University of Washington in Seattle,
where we both gave lectures and absorbed the empirical process wisdom of
Ron Pyke and Galen Shorack. The published lecture notes 
show how closely our ideas have evolved in parallel since Bochum. I also
had the privilege of seeing a draft manuscript of a book on empirical processes
by Galen Shorack and Jon Wellner.
At Yale I have been helped by a number of friends. Dan Barry read and
criticized early drafts of the manuscript. Deb Nolan did the same for the
later drafts, and then helped with the proofreading. First Jeanne Boyce, and
then Barbara Amato, fed innumerable versions of the manuscript into the
DEC-20. John Hartigan inspired me to think.
The National Science Foundation has supported my research and writing
over several summers.
I am most grateful to everyone who has encouraged and aided me to get
this thing finished.
