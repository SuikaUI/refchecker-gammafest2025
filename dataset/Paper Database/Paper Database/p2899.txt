These proceedings contain the record of papers presented at the Seventh Annual
Conference on Evolutionary Programming. Held March 25-27, 1998, EP98 was
sponsored by the Evolutionary Programming Society in cooperation with the IEEE
Neural Networks Council and the PPSN V Steering Committee. Since its inception,
the purpose of this conference has been to foster communication and stimulate
interactions between researchers investigating all aspects of evolutionary computation.
The conference has steadily evolved into an open forum for discussing the current
state of the art and future directions of evolutionary computation.
In addition to returning to San Diego, CA, for 1998, this year's conference enjoyed
the largest number of papers presented and highest attendance since its inception in
1992. As part of the egalitarian nature of this conference, the papers presented span
the full spectrum of evolutionary computation, including evolutionary programming,
evolution strategies, genetic algorithms, genetic programming, cultural algorithms,
and other variants. Special sessions on biological modeling and particle swarm
augmented more traditional sessions on theory, operators, and representation. The
number and wide range of applications papers presented is particularly notable. It is
an important indicator that these techniques are being used successfully in real-world
problem domains.
Creating a successful conference always takes a considerable effort and involves
many people. The Evolutionary Programming Society would like to express its
appreciation to the program committee for the!r diligent efforts to maintain the high
quality of the papers, the conference volunteers Jacquelyn, Verna, and Eva for their
cheerful, ever helpful presence, and to the team of Natural Selection, Inc., for their
gracious support. Finally, special thanks go to David Fogel and Peter Angeline,
whose hard work behind the scenes ensured the success of the conference.
