Abstract: We provide a new approach to automatic business forecasting based on an extended
range of exponential smoothing methods. Each method in our taxonomy of exponential smoothing
methods can be shown to be equivalent to the forecasts obtained from a state space model. This
allows (1) the easy calculation of the likelihood, the AIC and other model selection criteria; (2)
the computation of prediction intervals for each method; and (3) random simulation from the
underlying state space model. We demonstrate the methods by applying them to the data from the
M-competition and the M3-competition.
Keywords: automatic forecasting, exponential smoothing, prediction intervals, state space models.
1 Introduction
In business, there is a frequent need for fully automatic forecasting that takes into account trend,
seasonality and other features of the data without need for human intervention. For example, this
need arises in supply chain management where forecasts of demand are required on a regular basis
for very large numbers of time series so that inventory levels can be planned to provide an accept­
able level of service to customers. Current methodology involves the use of highly complicated
techniques such as automatic Box-Jenkins procedures that are often poorly under­
stood, or simple exponential smoothing methods that often do not capture the range
of data adequately and for which there are often no prediction intervals provided.

A state space framework for automatic forecasting using exponential smoothing methods
Although the exponential smoothing methods have been around since the 1950s, there has not been
a well-developed modelling framework incorporating stochastic models, likelihood calculation, pre­
diction intervals and procedures for model selection. In this paper, we aim to ﬁll that gap by provid­
ing such a framework for exponential smoothing methods.
We note that some important steps toward this framework were established by Gardner ,
and Ord, Koehler & Snyder . Earlier work in establishing prediction intervals for exponen­
tial smoothing methods appeared in Chatﬁeld and Yar , Ord, Koehler and Snyder and
Koehler, Snyder and Ord .
The work of Brown and Gardner has led to the use of exponential smoothing in auto­
matic forecasting . However, we develop a more general class
of methods with a uniform approach to calculation of prediction intervals, maximum likelihood es­
timation and the exact calculation of model selection criteria such as Akaike’s Information Criterion.
Makridakis, Wheelwright and Hyndman advocate the models in the taxonomy proposed by
Pegels and extended by Gardner . We shall adopt the same taxonomy (with some modi­
ﬁcations) as a framework for model selection for exponential smoothing methods. Each model has a
trend component and a seasonal component as given in the following table.

A state space framework for automatic forecasting using exponential smoothing methods
is given by cell B3. The other cells correspond to less commonly used but analogous methods.
For each of the 12 methods in the framework, we can derive an equivalent state space formulation
with a single source of error following the general approach of Ord, Koehler and Snyder ,
hereafter referred to as OKS. This enables easy calculation of the likelihood, and provides facilities
to compute prediction intervals for each model. A single source of error model is preferable to a
multiple source of error model because it allows the state space formulation of non-linear as well as
linear cases, and allows the state equations to be expressed in a form that coincides with the error­
correction form of the usual smoothing equations. To date, a state space formulation for models A1,
B1, B2 and B3 has been derived but not for the other models in our framework.
We show in Section 3 that for each of the 12 methods in the above table, there are two possible
state space models corresponding to the additive error and the multiplicative error cases. These give
equivalent point forecasts although different prediction intervals and different likelihoods. One of
the interesting results from our framework and methodology is that we can distinguish multiplicative
seasonality (or trend) in the mean from a multiplicative error term.
We propose an automatic forecasting procedure that tries each of these 24 state space models on a
given time series and selects the “best” method using the AIC.
In Section 2 we describe a general approach to writing the point forecast equations for each of the
methods, and Section 3 gives the state space equations for both the additive error and multiplicative
error versions of each method. Estimation and model selection is discussed in Section 4 and the
results are used to formulate an automatic forecasting algorithm which is outlined in Section 4.2. We
experiment with several variations on the algorithm by applying it to the 1001 series from the M-
Competition . The results of these experiments are summarized in Section 5
and we select the best variation of the algorithm. Section 6 describes the results of applying our
algorithm to the 3003 series from the M3-competition and Section 7
describes a Monte Carlo case study in applying the automatic forecasting algorithm.

2 Point forecast equations
Following Makridakis, Wheelwright and Hyndman , we can write each of the 12 exponential
smoothing methods as follows.
`t = αPt + (1 − α)Qt
bt = βRt + (φ − β)bt−1
st = γTt + (1 − γ)st−m
where m denotes the number of seasons in a year, P , Q, R, and T vary according to which of the cells
the method belongs, and α, β, γ and φ are constants. Table 1 shows the values of P , Q, R, and T and
the formulae for computing point forecasts h periods ahead.
These equations differ slightly from the equations given in Makridakis, Wheelwright and Hyndman
 . First, we consider the damped trend models. Second, we use Qt in place of `t in

the equations for Tt. The effect of using the equations as given in Table 1 is that when we update the
seasonal component we use the level `t−1 and growth rate bt−1 from the previous time period rather
than the newly revised level `t from the current time period. This alternative form of the equations is
designed to allow the models to be written in state space form (see Section 3). The equations we use
for B3 are not the usual Holt-Winters equations, but are equivalent to those used by OKS. It should
be noted that this change makes no difference for the models with additive seasonality, but it does
change the forecasts slightly for models with multiplicative seasonality.
The formulas for damped trend are appropriate when there is trend in the time series, but one be­
lieves that continuing to use the ﬁnal estimate for the growth rate at the end of the historical data
would lead to unrealistic forecasts. Thus, the equations for damped trend do what the name in­
dicates: dampen the trend as the length of the forecast horizon increases. In Table 1, one can see
that the forecast for h-periods-ahead is Ft+h = `t + (1 + φ +
+ φh−1)bt. The trend is dampened
by a factor of φ for each additional future time period. Our formulas for damped trend differ from
those of Gardner by a factor of φ. Gardner begins the dampening immediately for the forecast
one-period-ahead and his forecast function is Ft+h = `t + (φ + φ2 +
Writing (1)–(3) in their error-correction form we obtain
`t = Qt + α(Pt − Qt)
bt = φbt−1 + β(Rt − bt−1)
st = st−m + γ(Tt − st−m).
The model with ﬁxed level (constant over time) is obtained by setting α = 0, the model with ﬁxed
trend (drift) is obtained by setting β = 0, and the model with ﬁxed seasonal pattern is obtained by
setting γ = 0. Note also that the additive trend methods are obtained by letting φ = 1 in the damped
trend methods.

3 State space models
Ord, Koehler and Snyder discuss special cases of the “single source of error” state space mod­
els that underlie some of the exponential smoothing methods. We expand their work to cover all
the methods in the classiﬁcation outlined in Section 1. For each method, we obtain two models—a
model with additive errors and a model with multiplicative errors. The pointwise forecasts for the
two models are identical, but prediction intervals will differ.
The general OKS framework involves a state vector xt = (`t, bt, st, st−1, . . . , st−(m−1)) and state space
equations of the form
Yt = h(xt−1) + k(xt−1)εt
xt = f(xt−1) + g(xt−1)εt
where {εt} is a Gaussian white noise process with mean zero and variance σ2 . We deﬁne et =
k(xt−1)εt and µt = h(xt−1). Then Yt = µt + et.
The model with additive errors is written as Yt = µt + εt where µt = F(t−1)+1 denotes the one-step
forecast made at time t − 1. So, in this case, k(xt−1) = 1. The model with multiplicative errors is
written as Yt = µt(1 + εt). Thus, k(xt−1) = µt for this model and εt = et/µt = (Yt − µt)/µt and hence
εt is a relative error for the multiplicative model.
All the methods in Table 1 can be written in the form (7) and (8). The underlying equations are given
in Table 2. The models are not unique. Clearly, any value of k(xt−1) will lead to identical point
forecasts for Yt. For example, Koehler, Snyder and Ord and Archibald give several
models for B3 by altering the value of k(xt−1).
The only difference between the additive error and multiplicative error models is in the observa­
tion equation (7). The state equation (8) can be put in exactly the same form by substituting εt =
et/k(xt−1) into each state equation. For example, consider cell A1. For the additive error model
`t = `t−1 + αet.

Table 2: State space equations for each additive error model in the classiﬁcation. Multiplicative error models
are obtained by replacing εt by µtεt in the above equations.
For the multiplicative error model
εt = et/k(xt−1) = et/`t−1
`t = `t−1(1 + αεt) = `t−1 + αet.
Thus the state equations are identical in form.
Note that not all of the 24 state space models are appropriate for all data. The multiplicative error
models are not well deﬁned if there are zeros in the data. Similarly, we don’t consider the additive
error models with multiplicative trend or multiplicative seasonality if any observations are zero.
Further, if the data are not quarterly or monthly (and do not have some other obvious seasonal
period), then we do not consider any of the seasonal methods.

4 Estimation and model selection
L∗(θ, X0) = n log
t /k2(xt−1) + 2
log |k(xt−1)|.
Then L∗ is equal to twice the negative logarithm of the conditional likelihood function in OKS with
constant terms eliminated.
The parameters θ = (α, β, γ, φ) and initial states X0 = (`0, b0, s0, s−1, . . . , s−m+1) can be estimated
by minimizing L∗. Alternatively, estimates can be obtained by minimizing the one-step MSE, min­
imizing the one-step MAPE, minimizing the residual variance σ2 or via some other criterion for
measuring forecast error. We shall experiment with each of these estimation approaches in Section 5.
We constrain the estimation by restricting the parameters to lie within the following intervals
0.1 ≤ α ≤ 0.9,
0.1 ≤ β ≤ 0.9,
0.1 ≤ γ ≤ 0.9,
β ≤ φ ≤ 1.
Theoretically, α, β and γ can take values in (0, 1). However we use a smaller range to avoid insta­
bilities occurring. We also constrain the initial states X0 so that the seasonal indices add to zero for
additive seasonality, and add to m for multiplicative seasonality.
Models are selected using Akaike’s Information Criterion:
AIC = L∗(θˆ, Xˆ0) + 2p
where p is the number of parameters in θ and θˆ and Xˆ0 denote the estimates of θ and X0. We select
the model that minimizes the AIC amongst all of the 24 models that are appropriate for the data.
Using the AIC for model selection is preferable to other measurements of forecast error such as the
MSE or MAPE as it penalizes against models containing too many parameters.
4.1 Initialization
The non-linear optimization requires some initial values. We use α = β = γ = 0.5 and φ = 0.9. The
initial values of `0, b0 and sk (k = −m + 1, . . . , 0) are obtained using the following heuristic scheme.
Hyndman, Koehler, Snyder & Grose: 21 August 2000
A state space framework for automatic forecasting using exponential smoothing methods
• For seasonal data, compute a 2 × m MA through the ﬁrst few years of data (we use up to four
years if the data are available). Denote this by {ft}, t = m/2 + 1, m/2 + 2, . . ..
• For additive seasonality, we detrend the data to obtain Yt − ft. For multiplicative seasonality,
we detrend the data to obtain Yt/ft. Then compute initial seasonal indices, s−m+1, . . . , s0, by
averaging the detrended data for each season over the ﬁrst 3 years available (from t = m/2 + 1
to t = 7m/2). We normalize these seasonal indices so they add to zero for additive seasonality,
and add to m for multiplicative seasonality.
• For seasonal data, compute a linear trend using OLS regression on the ﬁrst 10 seasonally ad­
justed values (using the seasonal indices obtained above) against a time variable t = 1, . . . , 10.
• For non-seasonal data, compute a linear trend on the ﬁrst 10 observations against a time vari­
able t = 1, . . . , 10.
• Then set `0 to be the intercept of the trend.
• For additive trend, set b0 to be the slope of the trend.
• For multiplicative trend, set b0 = 1 + b/a where a denotes the intercept and b denotes the slope
of the ﬁtted trend.
These heuristic values of the initial state X0 are then reﬁned by estimating them as parameters along
with the elements of θ.
4.2 Automatic forecasting
We combine the preceding ideas to obtain a robust and widely applicable automatic forecasting al­
gorithm. The steps involved are summarized below.
• We apply each of the 24 models that are appropriate to the data, and optimize the parameters
of the model in each case to suit the data, starting with the initial values given in Section 4.1.
• We select the best of the models according to Akaike’s Information Criterion.
• We produce forecasts using the best model (with optimized parameters).
• To obtain prediction intervals, we use a bootstrap method by simulating 5000 future sample
paths for {Yn+1, . . . , Yn+h} and ﬁnding the α/2 and 1 − α/2 percentiles of the simulated data
at each forecasting horizon. The sample paths are generated using the normal distribution for
errors (parametric bootstrap) or using the resampled errors (ordinary bootstrap).

5 Application to M-competition data
To test the algorithm, and to experiment with the various estimation approaches possible, we applied
the algorithm to the 1001 series of the M-competition data . We tested the
following ﬁve estimation methods:
1 MLE: minimizing L∗;
2 MSE: Minimizing MSE;
3 MAPE: Minimizing MAPE;
4 AMSE: Minimizing (MSE1 + MSE2 + MSE3)/3 where MSEk denotes the mean square of the
k-step forecast errors;
5 Sigma: Minimizing the residual variance σ2 .
For each of the 5 methods of estimation, we computed forecasts up to 18 steps ahead (the number
of steps as speciﬁed in the M-competition). Then we computed the MAPEs for all forecast horizons,
averaging across all 1001 series.
Table 3 shows the results where the MAPE is averaged across all forecast horizons. Similar results for
the 504 non-seasonal series, 89 quarterly series and 406 monthly series are given in Table 4. Overall,
AMSE estimation seems to perform the best, closely followed by MSE estimation.
We note that the these are out-of-sample forecast accuracy measures. The results contradict the con­
clusions of Armstrong and Collopy who claim that the MSE is unreliable.
We also compared the performance of the methods on how frequently prediction intervals contained
the true values of the series. For each combination of methods, we computed the percentage of true
values contained in the (nominally) 95% prediction intervals. We did this using both parametric
intervals (PPI) based on normally distributed errors and nonparametric intervals (NPPI) based on
resampling the ﬁtted errors. The results are reported in Tables 3 and 5. All ﬁve estimation methods
underestimate the coverage probability of prediction intervals. Interestingly, the methods
resulting in the best MAPE values seem to give the worst coverage probabilities, and vice-versa.

M-competition. Figure 2 shows the MAPE for each forecast horizon for our method and three of the
best-performing methods in the M-competition. Clearly, our method is comparable in performance to
these methods. Table 6 shows the average MAPE across various forecast horizons, and demonstrates
that our method performs better than the others shown for smaller forecast horizons, but not so well
for longer forecast horizons.

A smaller set of 111 series was used in the M-competition for comparisons with some more time­
consuming methods.

Again, this demonstrates that our method performs better than the others shown for
smaller forecast horizons, but not so well for longer forecast horizons. Figure 3 shows the MAPE

Table 8 shows the models selected for each of the 1001 series using AMSE estimation. The com­
monly used models A1 (simple exponential smoothing), and B1 (Holt’s method), were chosen most
frequently, providing some justiﬁcation for their popularity. Interestingly, the non-trended seasonal
models (A2 and A3) were selected much more frequently than the popular Holt-Winters’ models (B2
and B3). Damped trend models were selected a total of 224 times compared to 268 times for addi-

tive trend, 153 times for multiplicative trend and 356 times for no trend. Amongst seasonal series,
additive seasonality was selected 180 times, multiplicative seasonality 313 times, and no seasonal
component 4 times. Of the 1001 series, an additive error model was chosen 466 times and a multi­
plicative model was chosen 535 times.
For some models, the time taken for estimation of parameters was considerable (of the order of
several minutes). This particularly occurred with monthly data (where there are 13 initial states to
estimate) and a full trend/seasonal model (giving 4 parameters to estimate). Searching for optimal
values in a space of 17 dimensions can be very time-consuming!
Consequently, we propose the following two-stage procedure to speed up the computations:
1 Estimate θ while holding X0 at the heuristic values obtained in Section 4.1.
2 Then estimate X0 by minimizing AMSE while holding θˆ ﬁxed.
This procedure speeds the algorithm by reducing the number of dimensions over which to optimize.
The following table gives the average MAPE and computation time for the 1001 series from the M­
competition using AMSE estimation.

The “Heuristic only” method simply uses the initial values obtained in Section 4.1, and the “Full
optimization” method optimizes the initial values along with the parameters (as was done in all of
the preceding computations). Clearly, very little accuracy is lost by using the two-stage method and
a great deal of time can be saved.

6 Application to M3 data
Next, we applied our methodology to the M3-competition data . Based
on the results from the M-competition data, we used AMSE estimation and optimal initialization.
The results are given in Tables 9–15 along with some of the methods from the M3-competition. For each forecast horizon, we have also
provided a ranking of our method compared to the 24 methods used in the M3-competition. These
are based on the symmetric MAPEs averaged across series for each forecast horizon.
As with the M-competition data, our method performs best for short forecast horizons (up to 4–6
steps ahead). It seems to perform especially well on seasonal data, particularly monthly data. On the
other hand, it seems to perform rather poorly on annual, non-seasonal time series.

7 Model selection accuracy
We carried out some simulations of data from the underlying stochastic state space models and then
tried to identify the underlying model using the procedure outlined in Section 4.2. For these sim­
ulations, we used non-seasonal models and generated 5000 series for each model. The results are
summarized in Table 16.
The parameters used in generating these models are shown in Table 17. These parameters were
chosen to generate data that look reasonably realistic.
Clearly, the algorithm has a very high success rate at determining whether the errors should be
additive or multiplicative. The main source of error in model selection is mis-selecting the trend
component, especially for damped trend models. That is not surprising given the value of φ chosen
was very close to 1.

8 Conclusions
We have introduced a state space framework that subsumes all the exponential smoothing models
and which allows the computation of prediction intervals, likelihood and model selection criteria.
We have also proposed an automatic forecasting strategy based on the model framework.
Application of the automatic forecasting strategy to the M-competition data and IJF-M3 competition
data has demonstrated that our methodology is particularly good at short term forecasts (up to about
6 periods ahead). We note that we have not done any preprocessing of the data, identiﬁcation of
outliers or level shifts, or used any other strategy designed to improve the forecasts. These results
are based on a simple application of the algorithm to the data. We expect that our results could be
improved further if we used some sophisticated data preprocessing techniques as was done by some
of the competitors in the M3 competition.
For several decades, exponential smoothing has been considered an ad hoc approach to forecasting,
with no proper underlying stochastic formulation. That is no longer true. The state space framework
we have described brings exponential smoothing into the same class as ARIMA models, being widely
applicable and having a sound stochastic model behind the forecasts.
