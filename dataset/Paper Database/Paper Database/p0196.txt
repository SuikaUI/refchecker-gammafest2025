A New Collocation-Type Method for
Hammerstein Integral Equations
By Sunil Kumar and Ian H. Sloan
Abstract. We consider Hammerstein equations of the form
y(i)=f(t)+(hk(t,s)g(s,y(s))ds,
and present a new method for solving them numerically. The method is a collocation method
applied not to the equation in its original form, but rather to an equivalent equation for
g(t,y(t)).
The desired approximation to y is then obtained by use of the (exact)
+ fh k(t,s)z(s)ds,
Advantages of this method, compared with the direct collocation approximation for y, are
discussed. The main result in the paper is that, under suitable conditions, the resulting
approximation to y converges to the exact solution at a rate at least equal to that of the best
approximation to z from the space in which the collocation solution is sought.
1. Introduction. We present a new collocation-type method for the numerical
solution of nonlinear integral equations of Hammerstein type. These equations take
+ fh k(t,s)g(s,y(s))ds,
where -oo < a < b < oo, f, k, and g are known functions and y is the solution to
be determined. The function g(s, v) is assumed to be nonlinear in v. Appropriate
smoothness
assumptions
on /, k, and g, to be made later, will ensure that, in a
suitable Banach space, the right-hand side of Eq. (1.1) defines a completely continuous operator acting on v.
The standard collocation method [2, p. 700] approximates the solution y of Eq.
(1.1) by wn, where
the functions
unX,...,unn
being known, and the unknown
coefficients
bnX, ...,bnn being determined by requiring wn to satisfy the n nonlinear equations
(1.3) w„(rni)=f(Tni)+fk(Tni,s)g(s,wn(s))ds,
i = \,...,n,

for n distinct (collocation) points t„,, ..., rnn in [a, b\ The convergence of wn to y
may be proved,
under suitable conditions
on unX, ...,unn
and rnl,...,
applying the general theory of .
Substitution of (1.2) into (1.3) leads to a system of nonlinear equations for
bnV... ,b„„:
E »nj(^i)t'„j=f(r„i)
+ j k(Tn,,s)g
b„junj(s)\ds,
i = 1,...,« .
Usually, this system of nonlinear equations will have to be solved by some kind of
iterative method. It is therefore a marked disadvantage of the above collocation
method that the n definite integrals in (1.4) need to be evaluated at each step of the
iteration. In practice, these integrals will have to be approximated by a numerical
integration technique.
In contrast, an advantage of the method proposed below is that integrals of a
similar nature (see (1.10)) need to be calculated once only, and result in a closed set
of algebraic nonlinear equations for the n unknowns. In favorable cases (see, for
example, the problem studied in Section 5) it may even turn out that the required
integrals can be evaluated analytically.
Essentially, the new method involves finding a collocation approximation for the
function z defined by
z(t):=g(t,y(t)),
On substituting (1.5) into (1.1) we have immediately
+ fhk(t,s)z(s)ds,
and hence it follows from (1.5) that z satisfies the nonlinear integral equation
z(t) = g[t,f(t)+¡"k(t,s)z(s)ds]j,
In the following section we shall show that this equation is equivalent to (1.1), in the
sense of having solutions in one-to-one correspondence with the solutions of (1.1).
The collocation approximation
to z, by analogy with the standard collocation
method described above, is of the form
z„(0 = E anJunj(t), te[a,b],
where the coefficients anX,...,ann
are determined by collocating (1.7) at the collocation points Tnl,...,
(1-9) zn(rn¡)
= g(rm,f(rni)
k(Tn,,s)z„(s)ds
i = l,...,n,
unj(rni)anj
= g t„,,/(t„,)+
f k(Tn,,s)unj(s)dsanj\,
(1.10) y_i
i = l,...,n,
which is a closed set of « algebraic nonlinear equations for a x,..., ann.
HAMMERSTEIN INTEGRAL EQUATIONS
The required approximation to the solution y of (1.1) is obtained, within our
present method, by substituting the approximation zn into the right-hand side of
(1.6). That is, the approximation to v is v„, where
y„(t):=flA)+f*k(t,s)zn(s)ds
L / k(t,s)u (s)dsanj.
The principal task in this paper is to show that the approximation yn converges
under suitable conditions to an exact solution of (1.1), and to analyze the rate of this
convergence. This is carried out in Section 4, the preceding two sections being
devoted to establishing the equivalence of (1.1) and (1.7), and to the introduction of
some useful smoothness assumptions. The final section examines a numerical
example in some detail.
It may be remarked here that the passage from z„ to yn, achieved in (1.11) by the
application of an integral operator, will often give a rather smooth approximation
yn, even if zn is, say, a piecewise-constant approximation. This might be considered
another advantage of the proposed method compared with the conventional collocation method. It may be useful to observe that if g(s, y(s)) = y(s), whence (1.1)
reduces to a linear integral equation, then the approximation
v„ becomes what is
sometimes called a 'product-integration'
approximation . The linear case also
suggests another possibility: that under suitable circumstances, the final integration
in (1.11) may involve significant cancellation, and so may lead to yn converging to y
faster than z„ converges to z. Since this 'superconvergence' is a subtle question even
in the linear case - , we choose to defer its consideration to a future paper.
2. Operator Equations for y and z. In this section we write the integral equations
for v and z, Eqs. (1.1) and (1.7), in operator form, and establish that their solutions
are in one-to-one correspondence and have certain properties in common.
A convenient setting for the analysis of (1.1) is the space C = C[a, b], the Banach
space of continuous functions on [a, b] with the uniform norm
||.x|| = sup \x(t) \, x e C.
On the other hand, it is convenient to analyze (1.7) in the space Lx = Lx(a, b), the
Banach space of essentially bounded functions on (a, b) equipped with the norm
||w||= esssup|w(r)|,
in order to allow the possibility of discontinuous approximations to z.
It is also convenient to make the following assumptions on the functions /, A:, and
g in (1.1):
A2. the kernel k satisfies
\k(t,s)\ds
lim f \k(t,s) -k(t',s)\ds
= 0, t'e[a,b];
SUNIL KUMAR AND IAN H. SLOAN
A3, the function g(t, v) is defined and continuous on [a, b] X R.
Note that under assumption A2 it follows from the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem [9, p.
27] that the linear integral operator K, defined by
(Kw)(t):= fh k(t,s)w(s)ds,
is a compact operator from LK to C, and hence also from C to C. Being both
compact and linear, it is necessarily (see [9, p. 244]) completely continuous (ex.).
We also define a nonlinear operator T, differing from K merely by an inhomogeneous term:
T(w)(t):=f(t)+(Kw)(t),
te[a,b],weLx.
Clearly T, like K, is a c.c. operator from Lx to C.
Finally, we define a 'substitution' operator G by
G(x)(t):=g(t,x(t)),
te[a,b],xeC.
The substitution operator is a continuous, bounded operator on C [13, p. 81], but it
is not c.c. except in the uninteresting case in which the function g(t, v) is independent of v.
With the above notation, the integral equations (1.1) and (1.7) may be written as
v = TG(y), yeC,
z = GT(z), z e Lx.
Since T is c.c. from Lx to C, and G is continuous and bounded on C, it follows [13,
p. 74] that TG is c.c. on C, and GT is c.c. on Lx.
The following lemma forms the basis of our present method. It establishes the
one-to-one correspondence between the solutions of (2.3) and (2.4), a result which
has been pointed out by [13, p. 143].
Lemma 1. The sets STC:= [y e C:TG(y)
= y) and @cr:= [z e Lx:GT(z)
z} are in one-to-one correspondence. Specifically, G is a one-to-one operator from 0rc
onto @c7-, with inverse T.
In the present work we are interested only in solutions y* of (2.3) that are
geometrically isolated —that is to say, there exists some ball {y e C:\\y - y*\\
< a), with a > 0, that contains no solution of (2.3) other than v*.
Lemma 2. If y* is a geometrically isolated solution of (2.3), then z* := G(y*) is a
geometrically isolated solution of (2.4). Conversely, if z * is a geometrically isolated
solution of (2.4), theny* '■= T(z*) is a geometrically isolated solution of (2.3).
Proof. The result follows easily from the continuity of T and G. O
We shall subsequently make some use of a topological approach to the study of
nonlinear equations , . In this approach considerable importance attaches to
the index of a geometrically isolated solution of an equation such as (2.3). By
definition, the index of the geometrically isolated solution v* is the common value
of the rotation of the vector field / - TG (I being the identity) over all sufficiently
small spheres centered at v*. (For a discussion of rotation, see ; in particular, see
the properties listed on p. 100.)
HAMMERSTEIN INTEGRAL EQUATIONS
Lemma 3. Let y* be a geometrically isolated solution of (2.3) and let z* be the
corresponding geometrically isolated solution of (2.4). Then y* and z* have the same
Proof. This is a special case of Theorem 26.3 of . D
A geometrically isolated solution of a fixed-point equation is of particular interest
if its index is nonzero, since such solutions are generally stable under small
perturbations
of the problem. We shall exploit this property in the analysis of the
approximate method in Section 4. (Geometrically isolated solutions with index zero,
on the other hand, are much less favorable for approximate analysis, as may be
gathered from a consideration of the solution x* = 0 of the one-dimensional
fixed-point equation x = x — x2, which is equivalent to the equation x2 = 0.)
3. Smoothness of g. Under mild smoothness assumptions on g, the operator GT
in (2.4) is Fréchet differentiable. The usefulness of this knowledge becomes apparent
in the next section; in brief, it is that it opens the possibility of predicting the rate of
convergence of zn to z*, and hence of yn to y*.
Lemma 4. Suppose Al to A3 hold. Further, suppose that the partial derivative
gv(t, v) := dg(t, v)/dv exists and is continuous for a < / < b, -oo < v < oo. Then the
operator G is continuously Fréchet differentiable on C; its Fréchet derivative at x e C
is the multiplicative linear operator G'(x) given by
[G'(x)w](t)
= gv(t,x(t))w(t),
te[a,b],weC.
Furthermore,
the operator GT is continuously Fréchet differentiable on Lx; its Fréchet
derivative at z e Lx is the c.c. linear operator (GT)'(z)
[(GT)'(z)w](t)
= gu(t,f(t)+(Kz)(t))(Kw)(t),
t e [a,b], w e Lx.
Proof. The first result is well known [13, p. 81] and the second easily proved using
results in [9, p. 499] and [13, p. 77]. D
The link between the Fréchet derivative of GT and the topological considerations
at the end of the preceding section is provided by the following result, which is a
special case of a theorem of Leray and Schauder [13, p. 108].
Proposition
1. Assume Al to A3 hold, and let gv(t, v) exist and be continuous for
a < t < b, -oo < v < oo. Further, let z* be a solution of (2.4), and assume that the
linear operator (GT)'(z*)
does not have 1 as an eigenvalue. Then the solution z* is
geometrically isolated and has index ± 1.
In particular, under the conditions stated in the proposition, the solution z* is
stable under small perturbations. Following Keller , we shall say that the
solution z* is an isolated solution of (2.4) if Proposition 1 holds. It then follows that
an isolated solution is also geometrically isolated and has an index of ± 1.
4. Convergence of the Approximate Method. In this section we apply the theory
 , , of the approximate
solution of nonlinear operator equations by
projection methods, to prove the convergence of zn to z*, and hence the convergence
of yn to v*. (For other applications of this theory, see , , .) To this end we
first place the collocation procedure for approximating
z* within a projection
method framework , , by introducing an interpolatory projection operator
SUNIL KUMAR AND IAN H. SLOAN
Let the functions
unX,..., unn be piecewise continuous
on [a, b] (this, of course,
includes the continuous case) and such that each is right-continuous at point a, and
left-continuous
at every discontinuity as well as at point b. We assume, for
simplicity, that
unj(rni) = Sij, 1</,
where 8¡j is the Kronecker delta, since this may always be achieved by an appropriate basis transformation
within the subspace U„ '■= span{ unX,..., unn } c Lx.
Let Pn be the interpolatory projection operator from C + U„ to U„, defined, for
w e C + Un, by
y{fmJ)unJ(t), te[a,b}.
It may be easily shown that P„ is a bounded linear operator on C + Un with image
Un, that its norm is
||PJ= sup Z\unj(t)\,
and that it has the idempotent property P2 = Pn.
We shall assume that the subspace Un and the collocation points (t„,}"=1 are such
lim || w - Pnw || = 0 for all w e C.
It then follows from the Banach-Steinhaus (or uniform boundedness) theorem [9, p.
203] that Pn is uniformly bounded as an operator from C to Un c Lx. Hence (since
c - u ls equal to the right-hand side of (4.3))
where c, > 0 is independent of n.
Using the operator Pn, we may write the collocation equations (1.8) and (1.9) as
the single equation
zn = PnGT(zn),
From Lemmas 1 to 4 and a direct application of Theorem 19.7 of we now
1. Let y* e C be a geometrically isolated solution of (2.3), and let z* be
the corresponding solution of (2.4). Suppose Al to A3 hold, and that the interpolatory
operator Pn satisfies (4.4).
(i) If y* has a nonzero index, then there exists an n0 such that for n > n0, (4.6)
has a solution zn e U„ satisfying
\\z* — zn I -* 0 as n -» oo.
(ii) Suppose that the partial derivative gv(t,v)
exists and is continuous for a < t < b,
-oo < v < oo, and that 1 is not an eigenvalue of the linear operator (GT)'(z*).
there exists a neighborhood of z* and an nx such that for n > nx a solution zn of (4.6)
is unique in that neighborhood, and
r II 7* _ P 7* II < II 7* _ 7 || < r || 7* _ p 7* ||
rnz ||^IIZ
Zn||^C3||Z
where c2, c3 > 0 are independent of n.
HAMMERSTEIN INTEGRAL EQUATIONS
1. Under the conditions in Theorem l(ii) there exists a constant c4 > 0
Ik* ~~ ztiIh* c4 mi" llz* _ «HI-
Proof. For any <j> e U„,
= |(/-i>n)(z*-0)|<(l+||Pj|)||z*-o||.
The result now follows from the uniform boundedness of the operator Pn. D
Thus we see that z„ converges optimally to z*, in the sense that it converges to z*
with the same asymptotic order as the best approximation to z* from Un.
A convergence result for v„ is now easily obtained.
Theorem 2. Let y* e C be a geometrically isolated solution of (2.3), and let z* be
the corresponding solution of (2.4). Suppose Al to A3 hold, and that the interpolatory
operator Pn satisfies (4.4).
(i) If y* has a nonzero index, then with zn as in Theorem l(i), and n > n0, (1.11)
defines an approximation yn e C satisfying
I y * ~~ yn I ""* 0 asn -* oo.
(ii) Suppose that the partial derivative gv(t, v) exists and is continuous for a < t < b,
-oo < v < oo, and that 1 is not an eigenvalue of the linear operator (GT)'(z*).Then
for n > nx the approximationyn given by (1.11), with zn as in Theorem l(ii), satisfies
\\y* -y*\\< c5inf llz* - «HI.
where c5 > 0 is independent ofn.
Proof, (i) Since T maps Lœ to C, it follows immediately from the definition
y„ := T(zn) that yn e C. Now from Lemma 1,
v* = T(z*)=f+Kz*,
lU* "J^IIHI*^7*

0 as « ^ oo,
||A:||= sup J |A:(/,s)|dï < oo.
(ii) This follows similarly, with the aid of Corollary 1. D
Thus the rate of convergence of yn to y* is, at the very least, equal to the rate of
convergence of the best approximation to z* from Un.
5. A Numerical Example. In this section the proposed method is used to solve an
integral equation reformulation of the nonlinear two-point boundary value problem
v"(f)-exp(v(0)
= 0, re (0,1); v(0) = v(l) = 0,
which evidently is of some interest in magnetohydrodynamics
[3, p. 41]. This
problem has the unique solution
y*(t) = -ln(2) + 21n(c/cos(c(r - \)/2)),
SUNIL KUMAR AND IAN H. SLOAN
where c is the only solution of c/cos(c/4)
= {2, and may be reformulated as the
integral equation
(l k(t,s)exp(y(s))ds,
where the kernel
-s(l - t), s < t,
k(t,s) = ,' -r(l - s), s > t,
is the Green's function for the homogeneous problem
y"(t) = 0, te (0,1); y(0) = y(l) = 0.
Equation (5.1) was solved by the new method, with the collocation points chosen
to be t = (j - l)/(n
- 1), 7 = 1,...,«,
and the basis functions
unX,..., unn
defined as follows:
T«2)/(T„i - T„2). t e Kl.^L
otherwise;
Ut - rnJ_x)/(Tnj
t e (t„j_x,
= \ (' - rHj+l)/(r»j
- Vy+i). t e (t„,, t„,,+1] . j = 2,...,n
«n„(0 = "ni(i -0-
That is, the solution z*(t) = exp(y*(t)) of the integral equation
z(t) = exp f k(t,s)z(s)ds\,
was approximated by the process of continuous piecewise-linear collocation .
Note that for the above choice of the basis functions and collocation points, P„ is
a uniformly bounded operator on C and (4.4) holds . Notice that in this case
(4.1) also holds, and so the nonlinear system corresponding to (1.10) is simply
a„, = expl¿
k(Tni,s)unj(s)dsanJ\,
i = l,...,n.
The integrals in (5.2) (and later those in (1.11)) were calculated exactly, and the
system (5.2) was then solved for the unknowns anX,..., ann by Moré and Cosnard's
implementation of a modification of Brent's method . All computations
were carried out in double precision on a Vax 11/750 computer.
It is well known that approximation by piecewise-linear functions yields, at best,
0(h2) convergence, where h is the maximum distance between the breakpoints of
the pieces. Thus from Theorems 1 and 2 we expect
\\z* - zn\\= O(h^),
\\y* -yn\\=
with è,x = £2 = 2. This is confirmed by the results in Table I.
The maximum errors listed in Table I were estimated by taking the largest of the
computed errors at t = (i - l)/256, / = 1,..., 129. (Here we have used the fact that
(5.1) is symmetric about t = \.) Estimates of |t were obtained by using the formula
C1 = ln(||z*-zn||/|z*-z2n_1||)/ln(2).
The estimates of |2 were calculated similarly.
