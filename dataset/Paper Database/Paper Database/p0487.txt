The Problem of Inferring Causality
in Epidemiology
The notion of risk is central to
epidemiological research, both in its
original context of studying conditions
thought to be caused by a particular
factor and, more broadly, in predicting
the probability of a condition for
prognostic purposes. For prognostic
research, all factors associated with
the outcome are of interest, whether
they are causal or not. In aetiological
research, on the other hand, causality
is meaningful. Here, the focus is
often on assessing the effect of some
modifiable exposure on a disease with a
view to informing health interventions
at the individual or population level,
or health advice for particular risk
groups. For such intervention or advice
to be effective, it is important to verify
that the observed association between
the exposure and disease means that
the exposure is in fact causal for
the disease. For example, once the
relationship between periconceptual
maternal folate supplementation
and risk of neural tube defects was
established , the United States,
Canada, and Chile implemented
mandatory fortification of cereal flour
and related foods with folic acid and
reported reductions in neural tube
defect incidence between 27% and just
over 50% . However, observational
research has had several high-profile
failures when exposures that seemed to
affect disease risk were later shown to
be non-causal in follow-up randomised
controlled trials (RCTs). For instance,
observational evidence that seemed to
suggest that vitamin E is protective for
cardiovascular disease, beta-carotene
for cancer, and, more recently,
oestrogen for dementia, has now been
refuted . Since only candidate
causes with the strongest observational
support tend to be followed up in RCTs
when these are possible, it is likely that
many more reported observational
findings are not actually causal .
Inferring causality from observational
data is problematic as it is not always
clear which of two associated variables
is the cause and which the effect, or
whether both are common effects
of a third unobserved variable, or
confounder (see Glossary). The
direction of causality can sometimes be
determined by temporal criteria (e.g.,
the cause must precede the effect)
or from knowledge of the underlying
biology. Confounding is more difficult
to deal with because it is mainly due
to social, behavioural, or physiological
factors that are difficult to measure and
control for. In practice, one can never
be sure that the relevant confounders
have been identified and accounted
for. Besides the fact that RCTs are not
feasible or ethical for many exposures
of public health relevance, such as
toxins, physical activity, or complex
nutritional regimes, observational
studies also have some advantages over
RCTs; for example, the subjects in the
latter are not always representative
of the population for which an
intervention is being considered .
“Mendelian randomisation” provides
an alternative way of dealing with the
problems of observational studies
 , especially for the case where
confounding is believed to be present
but cannot be controlled for because it
is not fully understood.

Katan, 1986 This briefly outlines
the original idea behind the method
of Mendelian randomisation as it is
commonly used now.
PLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org

 in his early description of the
concept in 1986, although the first
implementation of this basic idea in
an epidemiological setting under the
flag of “Mendelian randomisation”
was more recent . Details of the
derivation of the approach and its
nomenclature are provided in a recent
review .
In the mid-1980s, there was
considerable debate over the
hypothesis that low serum cholesterol
levels might directly increase the risk
of cancer. Alternative explanations
for the observed association were
that cholesterol levels were lowered
by the presence of latent tumours
in future cancer patients (reverse
causation), or that both cancer risk and
cholesterol levels might be affected
by confounding factors like diet
and smoking. The observation that
individuals with abetalipoproteinaemia,
and hence negligible levels of serum
cholesterol, did not seem to be
predisposed to cancer led Katan to
the idea of finding a larger group
of individuals genetically inclined
towards lower cholesterol levels. The
apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene was
known to affect serum cholesterol,
the ApoE2 variant being associated
with lower levels. Katan’s idea was that
many individuals will carry the ApoE2
variant and thus will naturally have
lower cholesterol levels from birth.
Crucially, since genes are randomly
assigned during meiosis (which
gives rise to the name “Mendelian
randomisation”), these ApoE2 carriers
will not be systematically different from
carriers of the other ApoE alleles in
any other respect, and in consequence
there should be no confounding.
Only if low serum cholesterol is really
causal for the disease should cancer
patients have more ApoE2 alleles than
controls. Otherwise the distribution of
ApoE alleles should be similar in both
groups. This can be easily checked
from the observed distributions.
Katan’s reasoning corresponds
exactly to what is known as an
instrumental variable method in
econometrics . The genetic
variant acts as a so-called instrumental
variable (or instrument) and helps to
disentangle the confounded causal
relationship between intermediate
phenotype and disease. Once this
theoretical connection had been made,
epidemiologists were able to learn from
and adapt the methods that were so
well known in econometrics .
The three key assumptions for
Katan’s idea to work, and hence
for a genetic variant to qualify as an
instrumental variable, are illustrated
graphically in Figure 1 and interpreted
as follows.
The genetic variant is unrelated
to (independent of) the typical
confounding factors, i.e., the
graph has no arrow (in either
direction) connecting ApoE with the
confounders.
The genetic variant is (reliably)
associated with the exposure, i.e.,
there is an arrow connecting ApoE
to serum cholesterol and we can
accurately quantify the relationship
this represents.
For known exposure status
(cholesterol level) and known
confounders (if the confounders
were observable), i.e., conditional
on exposure and confounders, the
genetic variant is independent of
the outcome, i.e., ApoE does not
provide any additional information
for the prediction of cancer once
these two variables are measured.
An equivalent way of expressing this,
which is less precise but perhaps
more intuitive, is to say that there
is no direct effect of genotype on
disease (no single arrow between
ApoE and cancer) nor any other
mediated effect other than through
the exposure of interest (no other
routes in the graph between ApoE
and cancer).
Note that these assumptions have
to be justified from background
knowledge of the underlying biology.
Neither the first nor the third
assumption can be tested statistically
since they depend on the confounding
factors, which, by definition, are
unobserved. The first assumption
means that you must have reasonable
belief that your genetic variant is
unaffected by the sort of confounding
that might generally be expected of
such an exposure–disease relationship.
Fortunately, the very basis of Mendelian
randomisation rests on the knowledge
that alleles are randomly assigned
from parental alleles at meiosis (see
above), and this implies that, across the
population, genetic effects are relatively
robust, although not immune to
confounding . Furthermore, the
type of information needed to explore
this assumption is often available in
practice, as it is usually well-studied
genetic variants that are proposed as
instruments. Assumption 3 demands
a comprehensive understanding of
the underlying biological and clinical
science, and may appropriately be
considered in a sensitivity analysis.
Unlike the first and third, the second
assumption can formally be tested
using the observed data, and the
method works better the stronger
the association between gene and
If the three assumptions seem
reasonable (i.e., Figure 1 is believable),
then it can be shown that, as Katan
originally hypothesised, a simple
statistical test of association between
the ApoE genotype and cancer amounts
to a test for causal effect of cholesterol
levels on cancer .
The idea of using a gene as an
instrument to test for a causal effect
of an intermediate phenotype on a
disease has been used for a range
of other traits, some of which are
summarised in Table 1 . For
example, raised plasma fibrinogen
levels have been associated with an
elevated risk of coronary heart disease
(CHD) in large-scale prospective
studies, prompting suggestions
that methods to reduce fibrinogen
levels should be sought . If the
fibrinogen–CHD relationship were
causal, then such interventions could
have considerable clinical and public
health benefits. However, interventions
to lower plasma fibrinogen levels would
not be warranted if the association was
explained by confounding or reverse
causation. Doubts about a causal link
between fibrinogen and CHD have
doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0050177.g001
Figure 1. The ApoE Genotype as an
Instrumental Variable in a Mendelian
Randomisation Application
The arrows can be thought of as representing
causal relationships, but this is not what
matters here. What is essential is the
absence of an arrow between ApoE and the
confounders and between ApoE and cancer,
as detailed in the three key assumptions in
PLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org
August 2008 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e177
been raised by evidence that the
association is considerably attenuated
by adjustment for smoking, body mass
index, and plasma apolipoprotein B/
A1 ratio , and that there are many
known correlates of fibrinogen, only
some of which are typically measured
and adjusted for in individual studies
 . Furthermore, bezafibrate was
found to reduce plasma fibrinogen in
randomised controlled trials, but it did
not have a greater effect on CHD risk
than could already be explained by its
cholesterol-lowering effect .
Additional light can be cast on
this relationship from relevant
genetic studies. A recent large metaanalysis of genetic association studies
of fibrinogen promoter region
polymorphisms (G-455‡A and
C-148‡T) showed that there was a
mean increase in fibrinogen of 0.12
g/l (95% confidence interval [CI]
0.09 to 0.14) per copy of the A or T
allele. However, these same alleles
were not associated with CHD risk: the
odds ratio per allele was 0.98 (95%
CI 0.92 to 1.04) . Since the 95%
confidence interval includes the null
hypothesis value of 1, we cannot reject
the null hypothesis at the 5% level and
hence conclude that the data provide
little or no evidence for a causal effect
of fibrinogen on CHD. This could
be due to random error or lack of
power of the statistical test, which is
a problem with genetic association
studies when relatively small effects
are being sought. The findings are
also consistent with the hypothesis that
the associations shown previously in
observational studies are partially or
wholly explained by reverse causation
or confounding. Of course, as with any
test, the fact that an exposure appears
to be non-causal does not necessarily
mean that it is not clinically useful.
Clearly, it would be dangerous to stop
investigating the role of fibrinogen in
CHD risk because of such an outcome.
What is implied, however, is that more
investigation is required before making
any great investment in intervening on
fibrinogen levels.
Mendelian randomisation can
also be applied when the exposure
of interest is a modifiable behaviour
rather than an intermediate phenotype.
For example, Chen et al. consider
the causal effect of alcohol intake on
blood pressure. An RCT would be
problematic here, and measurement
of alcohol intake is prone to error.
Hence, observational data have to
be considered in a setting where
the causal relationship of interest is
known to be heavily confounded. In
some populations, a particular variant
(*2) of the ALDH2 gene is quite
common. The *2 variant is associated
with accumulation of acetaldehyde,
and therefore unpleasant symptoms,
after drinking alcohol. Carriers
of this variant tend to limit their
alcohol consumption, and alleles at
the ALDH2 locus can hence be used
as a surrogate or proxy for alcohol
intake . Based on this assumption,
a Mendelian randomisation metaanalysis approach, combining evidence
from several studies, indicated that

previous observational evidence on the
beneficial effects of moderate drinking
on blood pressure were possibly
misleading. Exploring biological
complexity is another important
application of the method, although
we have not focused on this aspect
here. Li et al. use a Mendelian
randomisation approach to infer
parts of biological causal pathways, for
Problems and Limitations
The limitations of Mendelian
randomisation fall into two main
categories. Firstly, the key assumptions
for a genotype to be an instrument
(see above) may not be plausible, in
which case any inference about the
causal effect will typically be biased.
Such limitations include the presence
of linkage disequilibrium, genetic
heterogeneity, pleiotropy, population
stratification, canalisation, or lack of
knowledge about the confounding
factors. These limitations have received
a lot of attention in the literature
 . However, graphs can be used
as a visual check, and some apparent
violations may not actually be problems
in practice .
For example, Figure 2 addresses the
case where the chosen instrument,
Gene1, is in linkage disequilibrium with
another gene, Gene2, which has not
been observed. Here, Gene2 directly
affects the disease level or risk, and
hence Gene1 is not an instrument
due to violation of the third key
assumption. However, if Gene2 only
affects the disease via its effect on the
same intermediate exposure, as shown
in Figure 3, there is no such violation
and Gene1 can be used as an instrument
in a Mendelian randomisation analysis.
Note that Gene1 would also qualify as
an instrument if its association with
the exposure was only via its association
with Gene2 (Figure 4). Hence, it does
not really matter whether Gene1 or
Gene2 is the causal variant for the
exposure when they are in linkage
disequilibrium, as either one qualifies
as an instrumental variable in this case.
A similar check for violations can
be applied to the situation described
in Lawlor et al. , where the
hypothesised causal effect of maternal
adiposity on offspring adiposity is
investigated using maternal FTO
genotype as an instrument. The
reason that one must also adjust for
offspring FTO genotype in the relevant
regression in order to perform a
Mendelian randomisation analysis
can be illustrated quite simply by the
graph in Figure 5. Without adjusting
for (conditioning on) offspring FTO,
key assumption 3 would be violated
due to the existence of an alternative
path to the outcome via this genotype.
Note that this situation is specific to
the graph in Figure 5, which assumes
that there is no other confounder of
offspring FTO and offspring adiposity
(such as paternal FTO).
If the three key assumptions of an
instrumental variable are satisfied
by the genetic variant, testing for a
causal effect of phenotype on disease
by testing for an association between
genotype and disease is straightforward
for most practical purposes. Any
statistical test that is appropriate for
the variables being considered will
suffice. However, calculation of the
magnitude of the causal effect requires
additional strong assumptions, such
as linearity of all relationships (e.g.,
constant increase of disease with
exposure) and no interactions. If these
assumptions are satisfied, we can obtain
an estimate of the causal effect from
a mathematically simple combination
of the observed genotype–disease and
genotype–exposure associations .
The second class of limitations of
Mendelian randomisation concerns the
validity of such additional assumptions.
These limitations have not generated
so much discussion to date, although
in many observational studies the
outcome is a binary variable, and,
under the mathematical models that
are typically applied—e.g., logistic
or probit regression—conventional
linearity is not satisfied . In
consequence, the estimate that is
valid in the all-linear case should not
really be applied to binary outcome
data, although it has sometimes been
advocated . Generalisations of
the instrumental variable method to
the non-linear case can be found in
the literature , but are
typically aimed at very different kinds
of applications. Their usefulness in the
context of Mendelian randomisation
has yet to be investigated. It is, perhaps,
important to stress that these extra
distributional assumptions are only an
issue for estimation of the magnitude
of the causal effect and not for testing
for the presence of such an effect.
The Future for Mendelian
Randomisation
A Mendelian randomisation analysis
does not aim to identify genetic factors
that are causal for disease risk in order
to target individuals on the basis of
their genotype. On the contrary, the
focus is on the causal association
between an exposure and a disease
with a view to informing the potential
impact of non-genetic interventions
on that exposure. To that end, such
analysis exploits a well-studied genetic

factor for its known relationship with
the exposure.
In order to widen the applicability of
the approach, more general methods
for the common, but statistically nonstandard, case with a binary disease
outcome need to be developed.
In particular, the relevance to
observational epidemiology of related
methods in other areas, especially in
terms of the particular assumptions
required, is currently being
investigated. We should also stress the
importance of obtaining good estimates
from genetic association studies, in
particular ensuring sufficiently large
sample sizes with adequate power to
detect the typically modest effects one
might expect for the determinants
of common multifactorial diseases
 . The need to formally
combine information from different
sources, such as the large biobanks that
are currently being set up worldwide, is
also essential .
Mendelian randomisation has
received its fair share of criticism
(e.g., ). One objection is that
good genetic instruments are not easy
to find, but recent rapid advances in
genetic epidemiology are addressing
this issue . Most criticisms concern
the violations of the key assumptions
implicit in Figure 1. Confounding of
the genotype–disease relationship is
one such violation that has received
some attention. However, it has
recently been re-emphasised that this
violation may not be as serious as may
at first appear because, as outlined
above, Mendelian randomisation
analyses are fundamentally less
susceptible to confounding than
conventional epidemiology analyses
It is often unavoidable (and sometimes
desirable) to use observational data
to infer causality, but it may then be
difficult to disentangle causation from
association, especially in the presence
of confounding. We would argue that
some of the confusion and misleading
interpretations of results from
observational studies are partly due to
the lack of a clear formal approach to
distinguish between association and
causation. Causal terminology is often
used loosely in the medical literature.
It is intended to convey more than a
simple association between potential
risk factors and their effects, but this
is rarely made explicit. More formal
approaches are based on the idea of
a hypothetical intervention ,
which seems particularly suited to
the present context where we have
potential health interventions in mind.
These formal approaches highlight the
usefulness of Mendelian randomisation
studies for inferring causality and
enable precise specification of the key
assumptions (as depicted in Figure 1)
necessary for the method to be valid.
Given the tendency of high-profile
findings to persist in the literature,
and influence public health and
clinical policy, long after they have
been formally refuted by RCT analyses
 , and given the expense and the
scientific and ethical constraints of
RCTs, it is fortunate that advances
in biology, biotechnology, and
epidemiology have provided us with
an alternative tool, in the shape of
Mendelian randomisation, that can
help us to formally assess causality
based on observational data. But
the approach demands a sound
understanding both of the underlying
biomedicine and of the statistical
assumptions invoked in its application.
If it is used wisely, Mendelian
randomisation could make a major
contribution to our understanding
of the aetiological architecture of
complex diseases; but if it is used
unthinkingly, it could sow seeds of
confusion and set back progress
in bioscience. This short article is
aimed at encouraging the former and
avoiding the latter. 
