Environment and Disease Risks

A new paradigm is needed to assess how a lifetime of exposure to environmental factors affects
the risk of developing chronic diseases.
Although the risks of developing chronic diseases are attributed to both genetic and
environmental factors, 70 to 90% of disease risks are probably due to differences in
environments (1–3). Yet, epidemiologists increasingly use genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) to investigate diseases, while relying on questionnaires to characterize
“environmental exposures.” This is because GWAS represent the only approach for
exploring the totality of any risk factor (genes, in this case) associated with disease
prevalence. Moreover, the value of costly genetic information is diminished when inaccurate
and imprecise environmental data lead to biased inferences regarding gene-environment
interactions (4). A more comprehensive and quantitative view of environmental exposure is
needed if epidemiologists are to discover the major causes of chronic diseases.
An obstacle to identifying the most important environmental exposures is the fragmentation
of epidemiological research along lines defined by different factors. When epidemiologists
investigate environmental risks, they tend to concentrate on a particular category of
exposures involving air and water pollution, occupation, diet and obesity, stress and
behavior, or types of infection. This slicing of the disease pie along parochial lines leads to
scientific separation and confuses the definition of “environmental exposures.” In fact, all of
these exposure categories can contribute to chronic diseases and should be investigated
collectively rather than separately.
To develop a more cohesive view of environmental exposure, it is important to recognize
that toxic effects are mediated through chemicals that alter critical molecules, cells, and
physiological processes inside the body. Thus, it would be reasonable to consider the
“environment” as the body’s internal chemical environment and “exposures” as the amounts
of biologically active chemicals in this internal environment. Under this view, exposures are
not restricted to chemicals (toxicants) entering the body from air, water, or food, for
example, but also include chemicals produced by inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid
peroxidation, infections, gut flora, and other natural processes (5, 6) (see the figure). This
internal chemical environment continually fluctuates during life due to changes in external
and internal sources, aging, infections, life-style, stress, psychosocial factors, and preexisting
 .

The term “exposome” refers to the totality of environmental exposures from conception
onwards, and has been proposed to be a critical entity for disease etiology (7). Recent
discussion has focused on whether and how to implement this vision (8). Although fully
characterizing human exposomes is daunting, strategies can be developed for getting
“snapshots” of critical portions of a person’s exposome during different stages of life. At
one extreme is a “bottom-up” strategy in which all chemicals in each external source of a
subject’s exposome are measured at each time point. Although this approach would have the
advantage of relating important exposures to the air, water, or diet, it would require
enormous effort and would miss essential components of the internal chemical environment
due to such factors as gender, obesity, inflammation, and stress. By contrast, a “top-down”
strategy would measure all chemicals (or products of their downstream processing or effects,
so-called read-outs or signatures) in a subject’s blood. This would require only a single
blood specimen at each time point and would relate directly to the person’s internal
chemical environment. Once important exposures have been identified in blood samples,
additional testing could determine their sources and methods to reduce them.
To make the top-down approach feasible, the exposome would comprise a profile of the
most prominent classes of toxicants that are known to cause disease, namely, reactive
electrophiles, endocrine (hormone) disruptors, modulators of immune responses, agents that
bind to cellular receptors, and metals. Exposures to these agents can be monitored in the
blood either by direct measurement or by looking for their effects on physiological processes
(such as metabolism). These processes generate products that serve as signatures and
biomarkers in the blood. For example, reactive electrophiles, which constitute the largest
class of toxic chemicals (6), cannot generally be measured in the blood. However,
metabolites of electrophiles are detectable in serum (9), and products of their reactions with
blood nucleophiles, like serum albumin, offer possible signatures (10). Estrogenic activity
could be used to monitor the effect of endocrine disruptors and can be measured through
serum biomarkers. Immune modulators trigger the production of cytokines and chemokines
that also can be measured in serum. Chemicals that bind to cellular receptors stimulate the
production of serum biomarkers that can be detected with high-throughput screens (11).
Metals are readily measured in blood (12), as are hormones, antibodies to pathogens, and
proteins released by cells in response to stress. The accumulation of biologically important
exposures may also be detected as changes to lymphocyte gene expression or in chemical
modifications of DNA (such as methylation) (13).
The environmental equivalent of a GWAS is possible when signatures and biomarkers of the
exposome are characterized in humans with known health outcomes. Indeed, a relevant
prototype for such a study examined associations between type 2 diabetes and 266 candidate
chemicals measured in blood or urine (14). It determined that exposure to certain chemicals
produced strong associations with the risk of type 2 diabetes, with effect sizes comparable to
the strongest genetic loci reported in GWAS. In another study, chromosome (telomere)
length in peripheral blood mononuclear cells responded to chronic psychological stress,
possibly mediated by the production of reactive oxygen species (15).
Characterizing the exposome represents a technological challenge like that of the human
genome project, which began when DNA sequencing was in its infancy (16). Analytical

systems are needed to process small amounts of blood from thousands of subjects. Assays
should be multiplexed for measuring many chemicals in each class of interest. Tandem mass
spectrometry, gene and protein chips, and microfluidic systems offer the means to do this.
Platforms for high-throughput assays should lead to economies of scale, again like those
experienced by the human genome project. And because exposome technologies would
provide feedback for therapeutic interventions and personalized medicine, they should
motivate the development of commercial devices for screening important environmental
exposures in blood samples.
With successful characterization of both exposomes and genomes, environmental and
genetic determinants of chronic diseases can be united in high-resolution studies that
examine gene-environment interactions. Such a union might even push the nature-versusnurture debate toward resolution.
