Algorithms for learning to rank Web documents usually assume a document’s relevance
is independent of other documents.
leads to learned ranking functions that produce rankings with redundant results.
contrast, user studies have shown that diversity at high ranks is often preferred. We
present two online learning algorithms that
directly learn a diverse ranking of documents
based on users’ clicking behavior. We show
that these algorithms minimize abandonment, or alternatively, maximize the probability that a relevant document is found in
the top k positions of a ranking. Moreover,
one of our algorithms asymptotically achieves
optimal worst-case performance even if users’
interests change.
1. Introduction
Web search has become an essential component of the
Internet infrastructure, and has hence attracted signiﬁcant interest from the machine learning community

data rather than manually labeled relevance judgments. Usage data is available in much larger quantities and at much lower cost. Moreover, unlike manual judgments, which need to be constantly updated
to stay relevant, usage data naturally reﬂects current
users’ needs and the documents currently available.
Although some researchers have transformed usage
data into relevance judgments, or used it to generate
features , we go one step further
by directly optimizing a usage-based metric.
Second, we propose an online learning approach for
learning from usage data. As training data is being
collected, it immediately impacts the rankings shown.
This means the learning problem we address is regret
minimization, where the goal is to minimize the total
number of poor rankings displayed over all time. In
particular, in this setting there is a natural tradeoﬀbetween exploration and exploitation: It may be valuable
in the long run to present some rankings with unknown
documents, to allow training data about these documents to be collected. In contrast, in the short run
exploitation is typically optimal. With only few exceptions , previous
work does not consider such an online approach.
Third and most importantly, except for , previous algorithms for learning to rank
have considered the relevance of each document independently of other documents. This is reﬂected in
the performance measures typically optimized, such
as Precision, Recall, Mean Average Precision (MAP)
 and Normalized
Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) . In fact, recent work has shown that these measures do not necessarily correlate with user satisfaction
 . Additionally, it intuitively
stands to reason that presenting many slight variations of the same relevant document in web search results may increase the MAP or NDCG score, yet would
be suboptimal for users. Moreover, web queries often
have diﬀerent meanings for diﬀerent users (a canonical
example is the query jaguar) suggesting that a ranking
with diverse documents may be preferable.
Learning Diverse Rankings with Multi-Armed Bandits
We will show how clickthrough data can be used to
learn rankings maximizing the probability that any
new user will ﬁnd at least one relevant document high
in the ranking.
2. Related Work
The standard approach for learning to rank uses training data, in the form of judgments assessing the relevance of individual documents to a query, to learn parameters θ for a scoring function f(q, di, θ). Given a
new query q, this function computes f(q, di, θ) for each
document di independently and ranks documents by
decreasing score .
This also applies to recent algorithms that learn θ
to maximize nonlinear performance measures such as
MAP and
NDCG .
The theoretical model that justiﬁes ranking documents in this way is the probabilistic ranking principle
 . It suggests that documents should
be ranked by their probablility of relevance to the
query. However, the optimality of such a ranking relies
on the assumption that there are no statistical dependencies between the probabilities of relevance among
documents – an assumption that is clearly violated in
practice. For example, if one document about jaguar
cars is not relevant to a user who issues the query
jaguar, other car pages become less likely to be relevant. Furthermore, empirical studies have shown that
given a ﬁxed query, the same document can have different relevance to diﬀerent users .
This undermines the assumption that each document
has a single relevance score that can be provided as
training data to the learning algorithm.
Finally, as
users are usually satisﬁed with ﬁnding a small number
of, or even just one, relevant document, the usefulness
and relevance of a document does depend on other
documents ranked higher.
As a result, most search engines today attempt to eliminate redundant results and produce diverse rankings
that include documents that are potentially relevant to
the query for diﬀerent reasons. However, learning optimally diverse rankings using expert judgments would
require document relevance to be measured for diﬀerent possible meanings of a query. While the TREC
interactive track1 provides some documents labeled in
this way for a small number of queries, such document
collections are even more diﬃcult to create than standard expert labeled collections.
1 interactive/t11i.html
Several non-learning algorithms for obtaining a diverse
ranking of documents from a non-diverse ranking have
been proposed. One common one is Maximal Marginal
Relevance (MMR) .
Given a similarity (relevance) measure between documents and queries sim1(d, q) and a similarity measure
between pairs of documents sim2(di, dj), MMR iteratively selects documents by repeatedly ﬁnding di =
argmaxd∈D λsim1(d, q) −(1 −λ) maxdj∈S sim2(d, dj)
where S is the set of documents already selected and
λ is a tuning parameter. In this way MMR selects the
most relevant documents that are also diﬀerent from
any documents already selected.
Critically, MMR requires that the relevance function
sim1(d, q), and the similarity function sim2(di, dj) is
known. It is usual to obtain sim1 and sim2 using algorithms such as those discussed above. The goal of
MMR is to rerank an already learned ranking (that of
ranking documents by decreasing sim1 score) to improve diversity. All previous approaches of which we
are aware that optimize diversity similarly require a
relevance function to be learned prior to performing
a diversiﬁcation step , with the exception of Chen
and Karger . Rather, they require that a model
for estimating the probability a document is relevant,
given a query and other non-relevant documents, is
available. In contrast, we directly learn a diverse ranking of documents using users’ clicking behavior.
3. Problem Formalization
We address the problem of learning an optimally diversiﬁed ranking of documents D = {d1, . . . , dn} for one
ﬁxed query. Suppose we have a population of users,
where each user ui considers some subset of documents
Ai ⊂D as relevant to the query, and the remainder of
the documents as non-relevant. Intuitively, users with
diﬀerent interpretations for the query would have different relevant sets, while users with similar interpretations would have similar relevant sets.
At time t, we interact with user ut with relevant
We present an ordered set of k documents,
Bt = (b1(t), . . . , bk(t)). The user considers the results
in order, and clicks on up to one document. The probability of user ut clicking on document di (conditional
on the user not clicking on a document presented earlier in the ranking) is assumed to be pti ∈ . We
refer to the vector of probabilities (pti)i∈D as the type
of user ut. In the simplest case, we could take pti = 1
if di ∈At and 0 otherwise, in which case the user
clicks on the ﬁrst relevant document or does not click
if no documents in Bt are relevant. However, in reality
clicks tend to be noisy although more relevant docu-

ments are more likely to be clicked on. In our analysis,
we will take pti ∈ .
We get payoﬀ1 if the user clicks, 0 if not. The goal is
to maximize the total payoﬀ, summing over all time.
This payoﬀrepresents the number of users who clicked
on any result, which can be interpreted as the user
ﬁnding at least one potentially relevant document (so
long as pti is higher when di ∈At than when di /∈At).
The event that a user does not click is called abandonment since the user abandoned the search results.
Abandonment is an important measure of user satisfaction because it indicates that users were presented
with search results of no potential interest.
4. Learning Algorithms
We now present two algorithms that directly minimize the abandonment rate.
At a high level, both
algorithms learn a marginal utility for each document
at each rank, displaying documents to maximize the
probability that a new user of the search system would
ﬁnd at least one relevant document within the top k
positions. The algorithms diﬀer in their assumptions.
4.1. Ranked Explore and Commit
The ﬁrst algorithm we present is a simple greedy strategy that assumes that user interests and documents
do not change over time.
As we will see, after T
time steps this algorithm achieves a payoﬀof at least
(1−1/e−ϵ)OPT −O(k3n/ϵ2 ln(k/δ)) with probability
at least 1 −δ. OPT denotes the maximal payoﬀthat
could be obtained if the click probabilities pti were
known ahead of time for all users and documents, and
(1 −1/e)OPT is the best obtainable polynomial time
approximation, as will be explained in Section 5.1.

Commit (REC) iteratively selects documents for each
rank. At each rank position i, every document dj is
presented a ﬁxed number x times, and the number of
clicks it receives during these presentations is recorded.
After nx presentations, the algorithm permanently assigns the document that received the most clicks to
the current rank, and moves on to the next rank.
4.2. Ranked Bandits Algorithm
Ranked Explore and Commit is purely greedy, meaning that after each document is selected, this decision is never revisited. In particular, this means that
if user interests or documents change, REC can perform arbitrarily poorly. In contrast, the Ranked Bandits Algorithm (RBA) achieves a combined payoﬀof
(1−1/e)OPT −O(k√Tn log n) after T time steps even
if documents and user interests change over time.
This algorithm leverages standard theoretical results
for multi-armed bandits. Multi-armed bandits (MAB)
are modeled on casino slot machines (sometimes called
one-armed bandits). The goal of standard MAB algorithms is to select the optimal sequence of slot machines to play to maximize the expected total reward
collected.
For further details, refer to . The ranked bandits algorithm runs an MAB
instance MABi for each rank i. Each of the k copies of
the multi-armed bandit algorithm maintains a value
(or index) for every document.
When selecting the
ranking to display to users, the algorithm MAB1 is
responsible for choosing which document is shown at
rank 1. Next, the algorithm MAB2 determines which
Learning Diverse Rankings with Multi-Armed Bandits
document is shown at rank 2, unless the same document was selected at the highest rank. In that case,
the second document is picked arbitrarily. This process is repeated to select all top k documents.
Next, after a user considers up to the top k documents
in order and clicks on one or none, we need to update
the indices. If the user clicks on a document actually
selected by an MAB instance, the reward for the arm
corresponding to that document for the multi-armed
bandit at that rank is 1.
The reward for the arms
corresponding to all other selected documents is 0. In
particular, note that the RBA treats the bandits corresponding to each rank independently. Precise pseudocode for the algorithm is presented in Algorithm 2.
A generalization of this algorithm, in an abstract setting without the application to Information Retrieval,
was discovered independently by Streeter and Golovin
The actual MAB algorithm used for each MABi instance is not critical, and in fact any algorithm for the
non-stochastic multi-armed bandit problem will suf-
ﬁce. Our theoretical analysis only requires that:
• The algorithm has a set S of n strategies.
• In each period t a payoﬀfunction ft : S → is
deﬁned. This function is not revealed to the algorithm, and may depend on the algorithm’s choices
before time t.
• In each period the algorithm chooses a (random)
element yt ∈S based on the feedback revealed in
prior periods.
• The feedback revealed in period t is ft(yt).
• The expected payoﬀs of the chosen strategies satisfy:
E[ft(yt)] ≥max
E[ft(y)] −R(T)
where R(T) is an explicit function in o(T) which
depends on the particular multi-armed bandit algorithm chosen, and the expectation is over any
randomness in the algorithm.
We will use the
Exp3 algorithm in our analysis, where R(T) =
 √Tn log n
 .
We will also later see that although these conditions
are needed to bound worst-case performance, better
practical performance may be obtained at the expense
of worst-case performance if they are relaxed.
5. Theoretical Analysis
We now present a theoretical analysis of the algorithms
presented in Section 4. First however, we discuss the
oﬄine version of this optimization problem.
5.1. The Oﬄine Optimization Problem
The problem of choosing the optimum set of k documents for a given user population is NP-hard, even if
all the information about the user population (i.e. the
set of relevant documents for each user) is given oﬄine
and we restrict ourselves to pij ∈{0, 1}. This is because selecting the optimal set of documents is equivalent to the maximum coverage problem: Given a positive integer k and a collection of subsets S1, S2, . . . , Sn
of an m-element set, ﬁnd k of the subsets whose union
has the largest possible cardinality.
The standard greedy algorithm for the maximum coverage problem, translated to our setting, iteratively
chooses the document that is relevant to the most users
for whom a relevant document has not yet been selected.
This algorithm is a (1 −1/e)-approximation
algorithm for this maximization problem .
The (1 −1/e) factor is optimal and
no better worst-case approximation ratio is achievable
in polynomial time unless NP ⊆DTIME
 nlog log n
 .
5.2. Analysis of Ranked Bandits Algorithm
We start by analyzing the Ranked Bandits Algorithm.
This algorithm works by simulating the oﬄine greedy
algorithm, using a separate instance of the multiarmed bandit algorithm for each step of the greedy
algorithm. Except for the sublinear regret term, the
combined payoﬀis as high as possible without violating the hardness-of-approximation result stated in the
preceding paragraph.
To analyze the RBA, we ﬁrst restrict ourselves to users
who click on any given document with probability either 0 or 1. We refer to this restricted type of user as a
deterministic user; we will relax the requirement later.
Additionally, this analysis applies to a worst case (and
hence ﬁxed) sequence of users.
Further, it is useful to introduce some notation. For a
set A and a sequence B = (b1, b2, . . . , bk), let
Gi(A, B) =
if A intersects {b1, . . . , bi}
gi(A, B) = Gi(A, B) −Gi−1(A, B)
Recalling that At is the set of documents relevant to
user ut, we see that Gk(At, B) is the payoﬀof presenting B to the user ut. Let
B∗= argmax
Gk(At, B),
Gk(At, B∗).
Learning Diverse Rankings with Multi-Armed Bandits
Recall that (ˆb1(t), . . . ,ˆbk(t)) is the sequence of documents chosen by the algorithms MAB1, . . . , MABk at
time t, and that (b1(t), . . . , bk(t)) is the sequence of
documents presented to the user. Deﬁne the feedback
function fit for algorithm MABi at time t, as follows:
if Gi−1(At, Bt) = 0 and b ∈At
Note that the value of fit deﬁned in the pseudocode for
the Ranked Bandits Algorithms is equal to fit(ˆbi(t)).
Lemma 1. For all i,
gi(At, Bt)
(Gk(At, B∗) −Gi−1(At, Bt))
Gi−1(At, Bt)
Proof. First, note that
gi(At, Bt) ≥fit(ˆbi(t)).
This is trivially true when fit(ˆbi(t)) = 0.
fit(ˆbi(t)) = 1, Gi−1(At, Bt) = 0 and ˆbi(t) ∈At. This
implies that bi(t) = ˆbi(t) and that gi(At, Bt) = 1.
Now using the regret bound for MABi we obtain
E[fit(ˆbi(t))] ≥max
E[fit(b)] −R(T)
−R(T). (2)
To complete the proof of the lemma, we will prove that
fit(b) ≥Gk(At, B∗) −Gi−1(At, Bt).
The lemma follows immediately by combining (1)-(3).
Observe that the left side of (3) is a non-negative
integer, while the right side takes one of the values
{−1, 0, 1}. Thus, to prove (3) it suﬃces to show that
the left side is greater than or equal to 1 whenever the
right side is equal to 1. The right side equals 1 only
when Gi−1(At, Bt) = 0 and At intersects B∗. In this
case it is clear that there exists at least one b ∈B∗
such that fit(b) = 1, hence the left side is greater than
or equal to 1.
Theorem 1. The algorithm’s combined payoﬀafter T
rounds satisﬁes:
Gk(At, Bt)
OPT −kR(T). (4)
Proof. We will prove, by induction on i, that
Gi(At, Bt)
OPT+iR(T).
The theorem follows by taking i = k and using the
inequality
In the base case i = 0, inequality (5) is trivial. For the
induction step, let
Zi = OPT −E
Gi(At, Bt)
Zi = Zi−1 −E
gi(At, Bt)
and Lemma 1 says that
gi(At, Bt)
k Zi−1 −R(T).
Combining (6) with (7), we obtain
Zi−1 + R(T).
Combining this with the induction hypothesis proves
The general case, in which user ui’s type vector
(pij)j∈D is an arbitrary element of D, can be reduced via a simple transformation to the case of deterministic users analyzed above. We replace user ui
with a random deterministic user ˆui whose type vector
ˆpi ∈{0, 1}D is sampled using the following rule: the
random variable ˆpij has distribution
with probability pij
with probability 1 −pij,
and these random variables are mutually independent.
Note that the clicking behavior of user ui when presented with a ranking B is identical to the clicking
behavior observed when a random user type ˆui is sampled from the above distribution, and the ranking B
is presented to this random user. Thus, if we apply
the speciﬁed transformation to users u1, u2, . . . , uT ,
obtaining a random sequence ˆu1, ˆu2, . . . , ˆuT of deterministic users, this transformation changes neither the
algorithm’s expected payoﬀnor that of the optimum
ranking B∗. Thus, Theorem 1 for general users can
be deduced by applying the same theorem to the random sequence ˆu1, . . . , ˆuT and taking the expectation of
the left and right sides of (4) over the random choices
involved in sampling ˆu1, . . . , ˆuT .
Learning Diverse Rankings with Multi-Armed Bandits
Note also that B∗is deﬁned as the optimal subset of
k documents, and OPT is the payoﬀof presenting B∗,
without specifying the order in which documents are
presented. However, the Ranked Bandits Algorithm
learns an order for the documents in addition to identifying a set of documents. In particular, given k′ < k,
RBA(k′) would receive exactly the same feedback as
the ﬁrst k′ instances of MABi receive when running
RBA(k). Hence any k′ sized preﬁx of the learned ranking also has the same performance bound with respect
the appropriate smaller set B′∗.
Finally, it is worth noting that this analysis cannot
be trivially extended to non-binary payoﬀs, for example when learning a ranking of web advertisements.
In particular, the greedy algorithm on which RBA is
based in the non-binary payoﬀcase can obtain a payoﬀ
that is a factor of k −ε below optimal, for any ε > 0.
5.3. Analysis of Ranked Explore and Commit
The analysis of the Ranked Explore and Commit
(REC) algorithm is analogous to that of the Ranked
Bandits algorithm, except that the equivalents of
Lemma 1 and Theorem 1 are only true with high probability after t0 = nxk time steps of exploration have
occurred. Let B denote the ranking selected by REC.
Lemma 2. Let x = 2k2/ϵ2 log(2k/δ). Assume At is
drawn i.i.d. from a ﬁxed distribution of user types. For
any i, with probability 1 −δ/k,
(Gk(At, B∗) −Gi−1(At, B))
Proof Outline. First note that in this setting, B∗and
OPT are deﬁned in expectation over the At drawn.
For any document, by Hoeﬀding’s inequality, with
probability 1 −δ/2k the true payoﬀof that document
explored at rank i is within ϵ/2k of the observed mean
payoﬀ. Hence the document selected at rank i is within
ϵ/k of the payoﬀof the best document available at
rank i. Now, the same proof as for Lemma 1 applies,
although with a diﬀerent regret R(T).
Theorem 2. With probability (1 −δ), the algorithm’s
combined payoﬀafter T rounds satisﬁes:
OPT −ϵT −nkx (8)
Proof Outline. Applying Lemma 2 for all i ∈{1, .., k},
with probability (1 −kδ/k) = (1 −δ) the conclusion
of the Lemma holds for all i.
Next, an analogous proof as for Theorem 1 applies,
except replacing R(T) with
kT and noting that the
regret during the nkx exploration steps is at most 1
for every time step.
It is interesting to note that, in contrast to the Ranked
Bandits Algorithm, this algorithm can be adapted to
the case where clicked documents provide real valued
payoﬀs. The only modiﬁcation necessary is that documents should always be presented by decreasing payoﬀ
value. However, we do not address this extension further due to space constraints.
6. Evaluation
In this section, we evaluate the Ranked Bandits and
Ranked Explore and Commit algorithms, as well as
two variants of RBA, with simulations using a user
and document model.
We chose a model that produces a user population and
document distribution designed to be realistic yet allow us to evaluate the performance of the presented
algorithms under diﬀerent levels of noise in user clicking behavior. Our model ﬁrst assigns each of 20 users
to topics of interest using a Chinese Restaurant Process with parameter θ = 3. This led
to a mean of 6.5 unique topics, with topic popularity
decaying according to a power law. Taking a collection
of 50 documents, we then randomly assigned as many
documents to each topic as there were users assigned
to the topic, leading to topics with more users having
more relevant documents. We set each document assigned to a topic as relevant to all users assigned to
that topic, and all other documents as non relevant.
The probabilities of a user clicking on relevant and
non-relevant documents were set to constants pR and
pNR respectively.
We tested by drawing one user uniformly from the
user population at each time step, and presented this
user with the ranking selected by each algorithm, using
k = 5. We report the average number of time steps
where the user clicked on a result, and the average
number of time steps where at least one of the presented documents was relevant to the user. All numbers we report are averages over 1,000 algorithm runs.
6.1. Performance Without Click Noise
We start by evaluating how well the REC and RBA
algorithms maximize the clickthrough rate in the simplest case when pR = 1 and pNR = 0. We also compare
their performance to the clickthrough rate that the
same users would generate if presented with a static
system that orders documents by decreasing true prob-

ability of relevance to the users assuming document
relevances are independent. Figure 1 shows that both
REC and RBA perform well above the static baseline
and well above the performance guarantee provided by
the theoretical results. This is not surprising, as the
(1 −1/e)OPT bound is a worst-case bound. In fact,
we see that REC with x = 1000 nearly matches the
performance of the best possible ranking after ﬁnishing its initial exploration phase. We also see that the
exploration parameter of REC plays a signiﬁcant role
in the performance, with lower exploration leading to
faster convergence but slightly lower ﬁnal performance.
Note that despite REC performing best here, the ranking learned by REC is ﬁxed after the exploration steps
have been performed. If user interests and documents
change over time, the performance of REC could fall
arbitrarily. In contrast, RBA is guaranteed to remain
near or above the (1 −1/e)OPT bound.
6.2. Eﬀect of Click Noise
In Figure 1, the clickthrough rate and fraction of users
who found a relevant document in the top k positions
is identical (since users click if and only if they are
presented with a relevant document).
In contrast,
Figure 2 shows how the fraction of users who ﬁnd
a relevant document decays as the probability of a
user clicking becomes noisier. The ﬁgure presents the
performance lines for REC and RBA across a range
of click probabilities, from (pR = 1, pNR = 0) to
(pR = 0.7, pNR = 0.3). We see that both algorithms
decay gracefully: as the clicks become noisier noisy,
the fraction of users presented with a relevant documents decays slowly.
6.3. Optimizing Practical Eﬀectiveness
Despite the theoretical results shown earlier, it would
be surprising if an algorithm designed for the worst

shows the clickthrough rate (which the algorithms optimize), and fraction of users who ﬁnd relevant documents (which is of more interest to information retrieval practitioners), for variants building on the insights of the ranked bandits idea.
Speciﬁcally, two
variants of RBA that have the best performance we
could obtain in our simulation are shown. We found
that using a UCB1-based multi-armed bandit algorithm in place of EXP3 improves
the performance of RBA substantially when user interests are static. Note however, that UCB1 does not satisfy the constraints presented in Section 4.2 because it
assumes rewards are identically distributed over time,
an assumption violated in our setting when changes in
the documents presented above rank i alter the reward
distribution at rank i. Nevertheless, we see that this
modiﬁcation substantially improves the performance
of RBA. We expect such an algorithm to perform best
when few documents are prone to radical shifts in popularity.
7. Conclusions and Extensions
We have presented a new formulation of the learning
to rank problem that explicitly takes into account the
relevance of diﬀerent documents being interdependent.
We presented, analyzed and evaluated two algorithms
and two variants for this learning setting.

theoretically sound manner, and that our algorithms
can be expected to perform reasonably in practice.
We plan to extend this work by addressing the nonbinary document relevance settings, and perform empirical evaluations using real users and real documents.
Furthermore, we plan to investigate how prior knowledge can be incorporated into the algorithms to improve speed of convergence. Finally, we plan to inves-

Popularity-Based Static Ranking
Figure 3. In a practical setting, it may be beneﬁcial to use a
variant of RBA to obtain improved performance at the cost
of weaker theoretical guarantees. Performance is shown in
realistic settings pR = 0.8, pNR = 0.2.
tigate if the bandits at diﬀerent ranks can be coupled
to improve the rate at which RBA converges.
