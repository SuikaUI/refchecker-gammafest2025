Several attempts

is to proxy willingness

added cost to society from increased air pollution,
or equivalently

T = money cost of transportation.
Our specification

of attributes,
rather than as a single commodity.’

associate the first housing
attribute,
hl, with a single measure of air pollution
and label it “a”. In order to apply the
calculus to the utility

for the household
we assume that
U is strictly concave with regard to the various housing attributes

The first step in our procedural
model is to specify the hedonic housing value

respect to the air pollution

a. This first order condition
is given below
as Eq. (2.3):

(2.3) states that in equilibrium
the household’s amlual willingness to pay
for a small improvement
in air quality
[ W,( h) ] is equal to the increased

(or renting)
a different
house with

Thus the second
step consists of calculating
the derivatives
of the hedonic housing price equation

i.e., @I( h)/cY( -u).
Calculated

this derivative

it is possible to identify

This is a classic identification
since one can imagine
a supply as well
as a demand
for each housing attribute
at every location.
the case of air pollution
it seems reasonable to assume that the supply is either
exogenously
fixed or at least unresponsive
to changes in household
tastes, so
that variations
in the level of air pollution
over space allow us to identify
about households’
for clean air.12 Thus, we proceed under
assumption
that it is possible to identify
households’ willingness
to pay for clean
air from the housing market data.
The fourth
and final step in evaluating
the dollar
of a scheme to
air quality
is to use the willingness-to-pay
to place a
dollar value on physical improvements
in air quality
by a meteorologi-
cal airshed model.
In Section V we perform
such an exercise and estimate the

that households

levels. Thus the willingness
to pay for marginal

is greater
as pollution
levels increase. Moreover,
these differences
seem to be

the average
