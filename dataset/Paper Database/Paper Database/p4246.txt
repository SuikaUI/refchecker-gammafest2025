In 2002 the University of Michigan Medical School created a one-month course in advanced medical
therapeutics (AMT). All senior medical students were required to complete the course. To provide some
flexibility for students who were interviewing for residency positions the AMT course was created using a
distance-learning model, and in the 20082009 academic year it was offered in a fully online format. The
components of the course are weekly case-based modules, a weekly online seminar, quizzes based on modules
and seminars, and a research project based on a therapeutic question. The paper discusses the development
and components of the AMT course, a survey of fourth-year medical students who participated in the course
between 2007 and 2010, and how the course evolved over three years.

n 2002, as part of a University of Michigan (UM)
Medical School general curriculum revision, a committee of clinical faculty recommended the creation
of a one-month course in advanced medical therapeutics
(AMT) that would be required for all senior students.
To give students some flexibility in scheduling to take the
course, it was to be offered three times per year. The
course would consist of lectures, small group sessions,
and student presentations. Development challenges included finding faculty members who would be available
and willing to participate in teaching the course, especially when it was to be repeated three times in short
succession, and addressing student absenteeism due to
residency interviews.
Faculty determined that developing the course using a
distance-learning model would likely address these challenges. There is a large and growing body of research
documenting the increasing popularity of distance-learning approaches to meet general and specific learning needs
in the health sciences. These reports provide strong
evidence that online learning is equally as effective (13)
or in some cases more effective (4) compared to classroom
learning. Findings related to learner preference are
inconsistent. In some cases the surveyed population
preferred classroom learning due to issues such as
teacher-student
interaction
they preferred online learning due to the uniformity
of the learning experience (5) and the flexibility and
convenience of this approach (6, 7). Although the research
findings provide significant support for online learning as
an effective pedagogical method, researchers warn that
appropriate instructional design and easy-to-access technology are both key to effective outcomes (8, 9). In fact, a
positive by-product of distance learning is the acquisition
of advanced computer-based skills (4, 10, 11).
A carefully designed and executed distance-learning
approach proved to be a good fit for the AMT course.
A set of online materials could be created and used
repeatedly, with updates handled as needed, limiting the
need for extensive and repeated faculty time and effort.
Students could access course materials from anywhere via
the internet, giving needed flexibility and resolving
potential travel/attendance conflicts associated with residency interviews. Also, this approach provided opportunities for active, self-directed learning.
Development of the AMT course
The content of the AMT course represents a collaborative
effort among more than 30 faculty members in the UM
Medical School’s basic science and clinical departments,
pharmacology,
emergency medicine, family practice, psychiatry, obstetrics/gynecology, and physical medicine and rehabilitation. Pedagogical and assessment approaches represent a
collaborative effort between the course director, a highly
regarded teacher and professor in infectious diseases, and

Design and programming was a collaboration between
the course director and multimedia design and development experts in the Medical School’s learning resource
A prototype was reviewed by curriculum leaders with
input from medical students and technologists. The final
structure of the course consisted of four components.
A weekly series of case-based modules (e.g., cardiology).
Weekly seminars.
Weekly online open-book quizzes.
A student research project submitted online at the
end of the course.
Each of these components is discussed below in detail.
Technical features
From a technical standpoint, the system employed basic
HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript. This
combination of technology has several advantages: the
product can be hosted on the university’s course management system (CMS); the course director can edit and
create cases using Dreamweaver and other text or web
editors; and the multimedia development team can
program cases as needed. Hosting the course materials
on the university’s web server also has advantages,
including pre-existing security and access control, familiarity of the medical students with the CMS and its
features, and the ability for course developers to track
utilization and evaluate the usefulness of course materials. Flash software is used for videos. This format is preinstalled on web browsers: it works on Macintosh and
Windows operating systems, and on computers that have
tight security restrictions such as those at the University
of Michigan Health System. Quizzes were created and
delivered to students via the Medical School’s Question-
Mark (Perception) quiz system. Finally, seminars were
webcast over Adobe Connect, which could easily be
accessed from laptop computers anywhere in the USA as
students interviewed for residencies.
Course content
Learning outcomes for the AMT course focus on
advanced cognitive processes, including analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, that underlie clinical reasoning and
complex decision-making. This contrasts with the rote
memorization of facts that students are required to
master in their pre-clinical years. Students are expected
to peruse the reference material which the faculty
provides, but they are also encouraged to seek other resources to answer questions and complete their projects.
Outside resources can include internet searches, library
holdings, and faculty consultation. It is hoped that
students leave this course with a greater appreciation
for self-education, especially as this relates to a critical
reading of the published literature.
Case-based modules
Online learning modules have been created for 20 topic
areas, and each week students are responsible for
reviewing four or five areas (Fig. 1). Topic areas were
chosen to represent a broad range of therapeutic issues
and we continue to add topics each year. More than 20
faculty members with expertise in each topic area have
provided content and references. Content includes between three and 11 case scenarios per topic area. Each
area contains figures, article links, and multiple-choice
questions with explanations for each right and wrong
answer (Fig. 2). In addition, one- to three-minute
videotaped explanations by faculty members are provided
for each multiple-choice question (Fig. 3). The video clips
provide insight and feedback focused on the practice of
medicine. References include recommended and supplemental material such as guidelines, articles, and Power-
Point slides (Fig. 4). Since the course was created, 270
references and PowerPoint presentations have been added
to the program. Students can choose topic areas they
would like to focus on; each area has a mandatory quiz
associated with it (see below). Each year faculty contributors are asked to review their modules and reference
material and make appropriate changes. If changes are
extensive another videotape is created.
Weekly seminars
Each week students must participate in a one-hour
seminar on a variety of topics, including both medical
and surgical therapies and how these are reported and
interpreted in academic journals. The first year the course
was implemented as a pilot, students were
expected to be physically present at seminars, and each
seminar was offered twice a week. The second year , because many students were interviewing during
the course, seminars were broadcast online using Adobe
Connect so traveling students could sign on to participate
remotely. Starting in 20082009 seminars were presented
completely online. Students are now required to sign on
live for at least two of four seminar sessions. Seminars are
recorded and can be viewed later by students who cannot
be online at the time of the session. A participating
student can see the speaker and the PowerPoint presentation and ask questions by texting. Although the speaker
can view a list of participants, he/she cannot see students
(Fig. 5). The seminars have been made more interactive by
including a polling function that allows the speaker to ask
students multiple-choice questions (Fig. 5 upper right).

All AMT quizzes are online. Initially, quizzes were
administered at the end of each week and included
content on the weekly topics. Quizzes were in the form
of case presentations, and students were given four hours
to complete 1012 questions. Quiz takers were allowed to
use any resources other than fellow students or content
experts to answer questions. During the pilot, quizzes

were composed of both multiple-choice and short-answer
questions; the short-answer questions were designed to
explore students’ thought processes in problem solving,
analysis, and synthesis. Because of the time that had to be
devoted to reading the short answers, categorizing them,
and providing feedback to 170 students, the format was
changed to multiple-choice type questions that assessed
higher-order thought processes. Since 20082009 each
topic area and seminar has an associated quiz with
between one and four questions. Students have 20
minutes per question and receive an immediate score
and feedback upon submitting the quiz (Fig. 6). Multiple-choice answers are given point values between 0 and
10 and explanations are given for the final score (Fig. 7).
Students can take each quiz at any time during the week.
Research project
Each student in the AMT course is required to complete
a research project and evaluate four other projects.
During the first week of the course students must identify
a therapeutic question that is of special interest to them
and submit a proposal to the course director. The
objective is for students to research a narrowly defined
therapeutic topic using eight or more scholarly references,
and then present the findings in a PowerPoint presentation, table, or document (Word). An example of an
appropriate project is ‘Efficacy of Palivizumab on the
Prevention of RSV in Children.’ This award-winning
project was narrowly defined and the student was able to
focus on one or two seminal papers on the topic. Projects
are turned in online at the end of the third week of the
course and each student is placed into one of six groups
based on their project category. During the fourth (and
last) week of the course students must evaluate four
projects in their designated group. The purpose of these
evaluations is to push students to think critically about
how therapeutic data are presented. Were the evaluated
papers valid? Was the presenter convincing? How could
the presentation have been improved? Finally, the course
directors grade each project based on organization, depth
of the literature review, and presentation of the material.
Each year between three and six students receive a
commendation for the best projects and up to three of
these students present an online seminar on their project.
A repository of previous projects, indexed based on
category (e.g., neurology), is available for students to
Final AMT grades are based on quizzes (60 per cent),
projects (20 per cent),
and seminar
attendance (20
per cent). Students are able to drop one quiz question
per week and must be present for two out of four
seminars. They are able to view their quiz scores online
at any time during the course.

Student evaluation of the AMT course
Survey tool
At the end of each AMT four-week session, students are
asked to complete an online course evaluation. The
survey has 21 questions, including 14 Likert scale items
and four questions that ask for comments. The Likert
scale items have four different formats with five possible
answers (Table 1). The mean score for each question is
between 1 and 5. For example, the mean score in 2008
2009 for the question ‘Course learning outcomes were
clear’ was 3.87 (between neutral and agree). Questions
requesting comments were:
If you answered ‘strongly disagree’ or ‘disagree ‘to
‘The three components of the course (online material and resources, seminars, project) fit together well
to assure learning,’ please explain.

What worked well in this course?
What did not work well in this course?
How can this course be improved?
Survey data have been obtained for 20072008 (Cohort
1), 20082009 (Cohort 2), and 20092010 (Cohort 3)
AMT student cohorts (n88, n82, n106, respectively). The only changes in the course that occurred
between these three cohorts were a change in quiz
structure (no more short answers; topic-focused quizzes)
and seminar structure (completely online seminars)
between Cohorts 1 and 2. The following is a summary
of the data separated into quantitative and qualitative
Quantitative
Table 1 summarizes the results for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3
students. Students in all cohorts spent nine to 14 hours
per week working on the AMT course. Most students
agreed and tended toward strong agreement that the
flexibility in the course assisted in scheduling interviews
in their fourth year, the technology worked well, and the
online material was easy to access. All three cohorts
agreed that the course was appropriately challenging and
stimulated thinking at a complex level (mean scores 3.80
4.14). The overall quality of the course was rated as good
to very good for Cohort 1 (mean 3.73) and Cohort 2
(mean 3.72), and improved in Cohort 3 (3.96).
Qualitative
The major qualitative findings were that most students
felt the flexibility of the course was a major asset, and
many felt the time required was more than they expected.
Regarding specific elements of the course, most respondents enjoyed the case-based modules and appreciated
the reference material. However, several students commented that there was too much information to sift
through in the modules and the reference section of each
module could be cut significantly to include the one or
two most important documents. In addition, several
respondents felt that some PowerPoint presentations
lacked sufficient detail to be stand-alone references.
Students generally enjoyed the online seminars but
expressed some stress about having to be physically they
have to be present for 2 of 4 sessions. Four or five

students in each cohort felt seminars were not necessary
at all and did not add value to the course.
Students expressed several concerns about the quiz
structure. Several felt that quiz questions were too
difficult and/or too ‘nit-picky’ and ‘not. . . designed to
test my knowledge from completing the case studies and
reading.’ Some respondents in all three cohorts mentioned a lack of correlation between case-based modules
and quizzes. Others, while acknowledging that quiz
questions were difficult, felt they were appropriately
challenging at the M4 level.
Regarding research projects, several respondents felt
these were a valuable learning experience and ‘a good
exercise for practice of evidence-based medicine.’ Major
concerns about the research project included a lack of
clear expectations for the project and lack of specific
grading criteria. A few students suggested abolishing the
project requirement altogether in order to decrease the
workload and allow more time to review the case-based
Changes in the AMT course and future
directions
Over the three years that the AMT course has been
required at the UM Medical School, several changes have
occurred. As mentioned, after 20072008 (Cohort 1) all
seminars were offered online and students could sign on
from anywhere in the USA. It was not unusual in
Cohorts 2 and 3 to have six or seven students signing
on from different cities (Fig. 8). Quizzes were changed
from questions with short answers to multiple-choice
questions with partial credit answers. Furthermore,
quizzes were offered throughout the week and were
associated with each case-based module. As a result of
these changes, there were fewer concerns among Cohorts
2 and 3 students about time constraints in completing the
quizzes. To make research projects more relevant and
challenging, several students in Cohorts 2 and 3 were
given commendations for outstanding projects, and six
students were asked to present their projects as a seminar
session in the fourth week of the final 20082009 and
20092010 AMT sessions.
Future changes are planned in all components of the
AMT course. First, case-based modules will be updated
and the reference section in each will be streamlined to
include more focused, relevant and updated materials.
Second, quiz questions will be reformulated to correspond to each case-based module. The questions will
continue to challenge higher-level thinking of the students (e.g., analysis, synthesis, evaluation), but we will
rewrite or drop questions perceived by students as
requiring too much attention to detail. Third, seminars will be made more interactive by adding polling
questions and possibly developing several point/counterpoint formats to generate discussion and highlight the
gray areas of medical therapeutics. There have been
discussions about using virtual-reality technology to
allow participants to be present in a virtual auditorium.

Fourth, research projects will continue but we will
develop better guidelines for preparing and grading the
projects. We will continue to recognize outstanding
projects with commendations and offers for winners to
present these projects as online seminars. Furthermore,
we are developing a repository of all projects so students
can peruse these in the future. Finally, the UM Medical
School is in the early stages of developing a learning
management system to assist students who wish to take
more responsibility for their learning. The AMT course is
currently piloting the system and results will be available
within the next year.
