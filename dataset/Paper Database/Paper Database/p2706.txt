Reducing and meta-analysing estimates from
distributed lag non-linear models
Antonio Gasparrini1* and Ben Armstrong2
Background: The two-stage time series design represents a powerful analytical tool in environmental epidemiology.
Recently, models for both stages have been extended with the development of distributed lag non-linear models
(DLNMs), a methodology for investigating simultaneously non-linear and lagged relationships, and multivariate
meta-analysis, a methodology to pool estimates of multi-parameter associations. However, the application of both
methods in two-stage analyses is prevented by the high-dimensional deﬁnition of DLNMs.
Methods: In this contribution we propose a method to synthesize DLNMs to simpler summaries, expressed by a
reduced set of parameters of one-dimensional functions, which are compatible with current multivariate
meta-analytical techniques. The methodology and modelling framework are implemented in R through the packages
dlnm and mvmeta.
Results: As an illustrative application, the method is adopted for the two-stage time series analysis of
temperature-mortality associations using data from 10 regions in England and Wales. R code and data are available as
supplementary online material.
Discussion and Conclusions: The methodology proposed here extends the use of DLNMs in two-stage analyses,
obtaining meta-analytical estimates of easily interpretable summaries from complex non-linear and delayed
associations. The approach relaxes the assumptions and avoids simpliﬁcations required by simpler modelling
approaches.

Background
Research on the health eﬀects of environmental stressors,
such as air pollution and temperature, often relies on time
series analysis using data from multiple locations, usually
cities . The analytical design adopted in this setting is commonly based on two-stage procedures, where
location-speciﬁc exposure-response relationships are estimated through a regression model in the ﬁrst stage, and
these estimates are then combined through meta-analysis
in the second stage .
Recently, the ﬁrst-stage modelling approaches have been
extended with the introduction of distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) , a methodology to describe
simultaneously non-linear and delayed dependencies.

This modelling class is based on the deﬁnition of a crossbasis, a bi-dimensional space of functions describing the
association along the spaces of predictor and lags. The
cross-basis is speciﬁed by the choice of two basis, one
for each dimension, among a set of possible options
such as splines, polynomials, or step functions. Concurrently, developments have been proposed also for the
second stage. In particular, techniques based on multivariate meta-analysis have been used to combine estimates of
associations deﬁned by multiple parameters, and applied
for either non-linear or lagged dependencies .
We recently provided an overview of the use of multivariate meta-analysis in this setting .
In this contribution we propose a method to reduce
estimates from DLNMs to summaries deﬁned in only
one dimension of predictor or lags, re-expressing the
ﬁt in terms of reduced parameters for the related
uni-dimensional basis functions. This step decreases the

number of parameters to be pooled in the second stage,
oﬀering a method to meta-analyse estimates from richly
parameterized non-linear and delayed exposure-response
relationships.
In the next section, we provide a brief recap of the
algebraic development of DLNMs and multivariate metaanalysis, and then describe the main statistical development, establishing a method to reduce the ﬁt of a
DLNM to summaries expressed in a single dimension.
A motivating example with an analysis of the relationship between temperature and all-cause mortality is used
throughout the paper to illustrate the statistical framework. We ﬁnally note some limitations and indicate future
directions for research. Supplementary online material
provides information on algebraic notation and software
(Additional ﬁle 1), and also includes the R code and data to
entirely reproduce the results in the example (Additional
ﬁles 2–3).
The two-stage time series design can be applied to series
of observations collected at each time t, with t = 1, . . . , Ni,
in each location i, with i = 1, . . . , m. First-stage regression models are ﬁtted to each series of Ni observations,
obtaining location-speciﬁc estimates of the association of
interest. These estimates are then pooled across locations
in the second stage, with the aim to estimate an average
exposure-response relationship and inspect heterogeneity
across locations.
An illustrative example
As an illustration, we describe an analysis of the relationship between temperature and all-cause mortality using
daily series of Ni = N = 5113 observations from each
of the m = 10 regions in England and Wales, in the
period 1993–2006. Further details on the dataset were
previously provided . The example is used throughout the paper to describe the steps of the modelling
framework and introduce the new methodological development. Speciﬁcally, the relationship is ﬂexibly estimated
in each region in the ﬁrst-stage analysis using DLNMs,
and then pooled in the second stage through multivariate meta-analysis. The example aims to demonstrate how
results from DLNMs are summarized in an analysis of
a single region, and then how these reduced summaries
can be combined across regions. Also, we illustrate a
comparison with simpler modelling approaches. Modelling choices are dictated by illustrative purposes, and the
results are not meant to provide substantive evidence on
the association.
Distributed lag non-linear models
The DLNM framework has been extensively described .
Here we provide a brief overview to facilitate the new
development, illustrated later. In particular, we will focus
on the bi-dimensional structure of this class of models,
represented by the two sets of basis functions applied to
derive the parameterization. Following the original paper,
we ﬁrst generalize the idea of simple distributed lag models (DLMs) and then introduce the non-linear extension.
The DLNM modelling class
Distributed
non-linear
expressed through a lag-basis and cross-basis function s(xt), respectively, of the N-length exposure series
=[ x1, . . . , xt, . . . , xN]T . The deﬁnition of s(xt) ﬁrst
requires the derivation of the N × (L + 1) matrix Q of
lagged exposures, so that qt· =[ xt, . . . , xt−ℓ, . . . , xt−L]T .
This step indirectly characterizes the new lag dimension
identiﬁed by the vector ℓ=[ 0, . . . , ℓ, . . . , L]T , with L as
maximum lag. Now, choosing a ﬁrst basis with dimension
vℓto represent the association along the new lag space, we
can compute a (L + 1) × vℓbasis matrix C by applying the
related functions to ℓ. A compact and general deﬁnition
of the lag-basis function s(xt) for DLMs is given by:
s(xt; η) =
t·c·kηk = qT
where diﬀerent models are speciﬁed with diﬀerent choices
of the basis to derive C. The transformed variables in
W = QC can be included in the design matrix of the ﬁrststage regression model, in order to estimate the vℓ-length
parameter vector η, with Cη representing the lag-speciﬁc
contributions.
The non-linear extension to DLNMs requires the choice
of a second basis with dimension vx to model the relationship along the space of the predictor x, obtaining the
N × vx basis matrix Z from the application of the related
functions to x. Applied together with the transformation
which deﬁnes the matrix of lagged exposures Q above, this
step produces a three-dimensional N × vx × (L + 1) array
˙R. The parameterization of the cross-basis function s(xt)
for DLNMs is then given by:
s(xt; η) =
tj·c·kηjk = wT
The simpler lag-basis for DLMs in (1) is a special case
of the more complex cross-basis for DLNMs in (2). These
models may be ﬁtted through common regression techniques with the inclusion of cross-basis matrix W in the
design matrix. The vector ˆη of estimated parameters of
the cross-basis function in (2) represents a simultaneously
non-linear and lagged dependency, and its length vx × vℓ
is equal to the product of the dimensions of the bases
for the two spaces. In completely parametric models as
those described here, this dimensionality is directly associated with the notion of degrees of freedom (df ), related
Gasparrini and Armstrong BMC Medical Research Methodology 2013, 13:1
 
 
to the ﬂexibility of the function and the smoothness of the
estimated dependency. In spite of the relatively complex
algebraic deﬁnition in (2), DLNMs are solely speciﬁed by
the choice of the two bases for deriving the matrices Z and
C. The software implementation of this methodology in
the R package dlnm has been previously described .
Summarizing the results from a DLNM
Fitted bi-dimensional cross-basis functions from DLNMs
can be interpreted by deriving predictions over a grid of
predictor and lag values, usually computed relative to a
reference predictor value. As a ﬁrst example, we show the
results of a single-location analysis, using data from the
North-East region of England. The temperature-mortality
relationship is modelled through the same cross-basis
used for the full two-stage analysis illustrated later, composed by two B-spline bases.
The results are shown in Figure 1. The top-left panel displays the bi-dimensional surface of the ﬁtted relative risk
(RR) in a 3-D graph, predicted for the grid of temperature
and lag values, with a reference black line corresponding
to the centering value of the basis for the predictor space
(here 17°C). Similarly to previous analyses, the ﬁgure
suggests an immediate increase in risk for high temperature, and a more delayed but protracted eﬀect for low
temperature.
This bi-dimensional representation contains details not
relevant for some interpretative purposes, and does not
easily allow presentation of conﬁdence intervals. The
analysis therefore commonly focuses on three speciﬁc
uni-dimensional summaries of the association, also illustrated in Figure 1. First, a predictor-speciﬁc summary
association at a given predictor value x0 can be deﬁned
along the lag space. As an example, this is reproduced in
the top-right panel for temperature x0 = 22°C, together
with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI), and corresponds to the
red line parallel to the reference in the 3-D graph. Second,
similarly, a lag-speciﬁc summary association at a given lag
value ℓ0 can be deﬁned along the predictor space. This is
shown in the bottom-left panel for lag ℓ0 = 4, and coincides with the red line in the 3-D graph perpendicular to
the reference. Third, the sum of the lag-speciﬁc contributions provides the overall cumulative association, showed
in the bottom-right panel of Figure 1. This last summary
oﬀers an estimate of the net eﬀect associated with a given
exposure cumulated over the lag period L, and is usually
the focus of the analysis.
Multivariate meta-analysis
The framework of multivariate meta-analysis has been
previously described , and its application for combining estimates of multi-parameter associations has
been recently illustrated . We oﬀer a brief summary
here, ﬁrstly illustrating the second-stage multivariate
meta-analytical model and then discussing its limitation
for pooling DLNMs.
The multivariate extension of meta-analysis
Speciﬁcation of the model assumes that a k-dimensional
set of outcome parameters ˆηi and associated k × k
(co)variance matrix Si have been estimated in each of the
i = 1, . . . , m studies. In the application for two-stage
time series analysis, these outcome parameters represent
regression coeﬃcients from the ﬁrst stage, while the term
study refers here to the ﬁrst-stage analysis in each location. The description below illustrates a random-eﬀects
multivariate meta-regression model, where ﬁxed-eﬀects
models or simple meta-analysis treated as special cases.
The model for location i is deﬁned as:
Uiβ , Si + 
where the location-speciﬁc estimated outcome parameters ˆηi are assumed to follow a k-dimensional multivariate
normal distribution. The k × kp block-diagonal matrix
Ui = I(k) ⊗uT
i is the Kronecker expansion of the locationspeciﬁc vector ui =[ u1, . . . , up]T of meta-variables. The
matrices  and Si represent the between and withinlocation (co)variance matrices, respectively. This multivariate meta-regression model is applied to estimate the
parameter vectors β and ξ. The former represents the
kp second-stage coeﬃcients deﬁning how the p metavariables are associated with each of the true k ﬁrst-stage
coeﬃcients in ηi. The vector ξ includes a set of parameters
which uniquely deﬁne the between-location (co)variance
matrix , depending on the chosen structure for this
matrix. In ﬁxed eﬀects models no additional variability beyond the estimation error in the ﬁrst-stage model
is assumed for ˆηi, and i = Si. In multivariate metaanalysis with no meta-variable, U = I(k) and β = η,
the vector of average parameters. The development in (3)
can be considered as a special case of multivariate linear mixed model , where the within-city (co)variance
is assumed known. Among alternative estimation methods, such as Bayesian and multivariate extensions of
the method of moments , we privilege here likelihoodbased approaches . Methods to derive tests and
conﬁdence intervals, ﬁt statistics and (best-linear unbiased) predictions have been previously developed within
the linear mixed models framework for the application in
this setting, together with a description of the software
implementation in the R package mvmeta .

in (2) can be meta-analysed using (3), producing
an population-averaged three-dimensional eﬀect surface
across locations, optionally conditional on meta-variables
in multivariate meta-regression. However, as anticipated
above, the deﬁnition of DLNMs in (2) requires k = vx ×
vℓparameters ˆηi for the cross-basis. For models speci-
ﬁed by even moderately complex bases in each space, the
number of parameters becomes so high that the optimization routine for multivariate meta-analysis is computationally impractical. This is particularly relevant for the
(co)variance terms in ξ deﬁning the true between-location
variability, composed by k(k + 1)/2 parameters for an
unstructured matrix .
This limitation is one of the main reasons which have
prevented so far the full application of DLNMs in twostage analysis. The modelling approach has often required
the simpliﬁcation of the ﬁrst-stage model, for the secondstage multivariate meta-analysis to be feasible. For example, investigators have assumed a linear relationship in the
dimension of the predictor , or computed a simple exposure moving average for the lag space . We
previously adopted the same limited approach . The
development of methods to derive meta-analytical estimates from full DLNMs would oﬀer a great deal of ﬂexibility in the investigation of complex exposure-response
dependencies.
Reducing DLNMs
Predictions from DLNMs as those shown in Figure 1 are
obtained by selecting the grid of exposure and lag values deﬁned as x[p] and ℓ[p], respectively. Details on the
algebraic development are given elsewhere [sections
4.2–4.3]. Brieﬂy, predictions are computed by deriving
matrices Z[p] and C[p] from x[p] and ℓ[p], respectively,
through the application of the same basis functions used
for estimation in (2). The bi-dimensional predicted relationship in location i is expressed by the full set of estimated parameters in ˆηi and quantities derived by Z[p] and
C[p]. However, the speciﬁc summaries described in the
previous section are deﬁned only on the single dimension
of predictor (lag-speciﬁc and overall cumulative associations, bottom panels of Figure 1) or lag . The idea is to
re-parameterize these summaries in terms of the related
uni-dimensional basis Z[p] or C[p] for predictor or lags
only, respectively, and sets of reduced in coeﬃcients ˆθi.
Dimensionality of the functions expressing such summaries therefore decreases from vx × vℓ, corresponding to
the length of vector ˆηi in the original parameterization, to
vx or vℓonly, corresponding to the length of new sets of
reduced parameters ˆθi.
The deﬁnition of the reduced parameters depends on
the speciﬁc summary among those listed above. They
can be obtained by applying a related dimension-reducing
matrix M, expressed as:
M[x0] = I(vℓ) ⊗zT
M[ℓ0] = cT
[ℓ0] ⊗I(vx)
(L+1)C ⊗I(vx)
for predictor-speciﬁc summary association at x0, for for
lag-speciﬁc summary association at ℓ0, and for overall
cumulative summary association, respectively. Here z[x0]
and c[ℓ0] are the vectors of transformed values of x0 and ℓ0
obtained by the application of the sets of basis functions
for predictor and lags, respectively. The reduced parameter vector ˆθi and associated (co)variance matrix V(ˆθi) are
then obtained by:
ˆθ[j]i = M[j] ˆηi
V(ˆθ[j]i) = M[j]V(ˆηi)MT
with j ∈{x0, ℓ0, c}. The predictor-speciﬁc association at
x0, deﬁned on the lag space for values in ℓ[p], is expressed
by C[p] ˆθ[x0]i, with standard errors provided by the square
root of C[p]V(ˆθ[x0]i)CT
[p]. The lag-speciﬁc association at
ℓ0 and the overall cumulative association, deﬁned on the
predictor dimension for values in x[p]i, are then obtained
by Z[p] ˆθ[ℓ0]i and Z[p] ˆθ[c]i, respectively, with computation
for standard errors as above. The number of coeﬃcients
deﬁning these summaries, reduced from vx ×vℓto vℓor vx
only, is usually compatible with the application of standard
multivariate meta-analysis techniques, which can now be
used to combine the estimates of these summaries from
DLNMs in two-stage analyses. In addition, the derivation in (4)–(5) simpliﬁes the algebra for DLNM predictions originally provided [Section 4.3]. The dimension
reduction comes at the price of loss of information about
the association on one of the two dimensions, as the rankdeﬁciency of M does not allow reversing the reduction
applied in (5).
The analysis is now extended to the full set of 10 regions,
with the aim to produce pooled estimates of the overall
cumulative association, and to compare the results with
those obtained by simpler approaches, applying a moving
average to the daily exposure series. Also, we investigate
the lag structure for exposure to cold and hot temperatures through predictor-speciﬁc estimates. Finally, we
assess heterogeneity and then the role of meta-variables
through multivariate meta-regression.
Modelling strategy
The ﬁrst-stage region-speciﬁc model is speciﬁed by
adopting a standard analytical approach for time series
environmental data . In each region, we ﬁt a common generalized linear model for the quasi-Poisson family
to the series of all-cause mortality counts. The model
includes the cross-basis for daily mean temperature, a natural cubic spline of time with 10 df /year to control for the
long-term and seasonal variation, and indicator variables
for day of the week.
In the main ﬁrst-stage model, the temperature-mortality
association is estimated by a ﬂexible cross-basis deﬁned by
a quadratic B-spline for the space of temperature, centered
at 17°C, and a natural cubic B-spline with intercept for the
space of lags, with maximum lag L = 21. We place two
internal knots at equally spaced values along temperature
(5.3°C and 15.1°C) and three internal knots at equallyspaced log-values of lag (1.0, 2.8 and 7.6), with boundary
knots at −4.4°C and 24.9°C, and 0 and 21 lags, respectively. These choices deﬁne spline bases with dimensions
vx = 4 and vℓ= 5 for temperature and lag spaces, respectively. The same speciﬁcation was previously applied for
the single-region analysis.
The set of vx × vℓ= 20 coeﬃcients of the cross-basis
variables with associated (co)variance matrices, estimated
in each region, are then reduced. Speciﬁcally, for region
i we derive the vector ˆθ[c]i with 4 reduced parameters of
the quadratic B-spline of temperature Z[p] for the overall cumulative summary association, and two vectors ˆθ i
and ˆθ i with sets of 5 reduced parameters of the natural
cubic B-spline of lags C[p] for predictor-speciﬁc summary
associations at 0°C and 22°C. These temperatures correspond approximately to the 1st and 99th of the pooled
temperature distribution, respectively. These eﬀects along
lags are interpreted using the reference of 17°C.
For comparison with methods not requiring dimensionality reduction, in two alternative ﬁrst-stage models
we simplify the lag structure by ﬁtting one-dimensional
splines to the moving average of the temperature series
over lag 0–3 and 0–21, respectively. Such moving average models have been commonly used in weather and
air pollution epidemiology . These alternatives
Gasparrini and Armstrong BMC Medical Research Methodology 2013, 13:1
 
 
can be described as DLNMs including cross-bases with a
constant function to represent the relationship in the lag
space, while keeping the same quadratic B-spline for the
space of the predictor, as described for the main model
above. In these simpliﬁed models, the dimension of ﬁtted relationship does not need to be reduced. In fact, the
application of the reduction method returns the original
vx × vℓ= 4 × 1 = 4 parameters re-scaled by the number of lags, giving a dimension-reducing matrix M[c], as
described in (4c), composed in this case by a diagonal
matrix with entries corresponding to a constant equal to
the number of lags.
The coeﬃcients for each of the three summary associations from the main model are estimated in the 10
regions and then independently included as outcomes in
three multivariate meta-analytical second-stage models.
The ten estimated sets of coeﬃcients from the two alternative models (equivalent to the overall cumulative summary) were directly meta-analysed. All the second-stage
models are ﬁtted here through restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using the R package mvmeta. We ﬁrst derive
an estimate of the pooled relationship through multivariate meta-analysis, and then extend the results showing an
example of multivariate meta-regression which includes
population-averaged regional latitude as a meta-variable.
The eﬀect of latitude is displayed by predicting the averaged temperature-mortality associations for the 25th and
75th percentiles of its distribution, using the same baseline reference of 17°C. The signiﬁcance of such an eﬀect is
assessed through a Wald test, given a likelihood ratio test
cannot be applied to compare model ﬁtted with REML
and diﬀerent ﬁxed-eﬀects structures .
Two-stage analysis
The overall temperature-mortality associations in the 10
regions of England and Wales are illustrated in Figure 2.
The left panel shows the regions-speciﬁc summary associations from the ﬁrst stage, together with the pooled
average from multivariate meta-analysis, as predicted by
the main ﬂexible model. Regions-speciﬁc estimates show
similar curves, although some variability exists, in particular at the extremes. Consistently with previous ﬁndings,
the pooled curve suggests an increase in relative risk (RR)
for both cold and hot temperatures, although less pronounced for the latter, and with a steeper increase for
extreme when compared to mild cold. The average point
of minimum mortality is at 17.1°C, corresponding approximately to the 90th percentile of the pooled temperature
distribution. The multivariate Cochran Q test for heterogeneity is highly signiﬁcant (p-value < 0.001), and the
related I2 statistic indicates that 63.7% of the variability is
due to true heterogeneity between regions.
The right panel of Figure 2 illustrates the comparison
with the two alternative simpler models. We see that the
association based on the 0–21 lag moving average temperature approximates that based on a ﬂexible DLNM in
the cold range, but completely misses the heat eﬀect. The
reverse is true for the association based on the 0–3 lag
moving average temperature.
Figure 3 depicts the pooled estimate from the main
model for predictor-speciﬁc summary associations at
22°C and 0°C, with the same reference of 17°C, as predicted by the two sets of vℓ= 5 reduced coeﬃcients.
Consistently with previous research, the eﬀect of hot temperature is immediate and disappears after 1–2 days, while
cold temperatures are associated with mortality for a long
lag period, after an initial protective eﬀect. This complex
lag pattern can explain the diﬀerent results provided by
the less ﬂexible alternative models. The pooled overall
RR estimated by the main model, cumulated along lags
for these speciﬁc summaries and reported graphically in
Figure 2 (left panel), are 1.101 (95%CI: 1.078–1.124) for
22°C and and 1.308 (95%CI: 1.245–1.375) for 0°C, respectively. The Cochran Q test is signiﬁcant for the lag curve at
0°C (p-value < 0.001), but not for that at 22°C (p-value =
0.178), with an I2 of 63.4% and 16.0%, respectively.
It is interesting to note that the second-stage multivariate meta-analytical model for the predictor-speciﬁc summary associations at 22°C estimates perfectly correlated
random components, with between-study correlations
equal to −1 or 1. This is a known phenomenon in multivariate meta-analysis, frequently occuring in the presence
of a small number of studies and/or a high within-study
uncertainty relative to the between-study variation .
However, in this case, the results from the Cochran Q
test suggest that a ﬁxed-eﬀects multivariate model may
be preferable, and as expected, this model returns almost
identical estimates for the pooled summary associations
(results not shown).
heterogeneity
explained as eﬀect modiﬁcation by region-speciﬁc variables. The results of the example of meta-regression with
latitude are illustrated in Figure 4. The top panel suggests
a diﬀerential overall cumulative association between
northern and southern regions, a pattern previously
reported . Interestingly, the eﬀect modiﬁcation
seems to occur for cold, with a higher eﬀect in southern
regions, but not for heat. The estimated pooled RR at 0°C
versus 17°C are 1.380 (95%CI: 1.337–1.424) and 1.237
(95%CI: 1.198–1.277) for the 25th and 75th percentiles of
latitude, respectively, while the same estimates are 1.106
(95%CI: 1.079–1.133) and 1.104 (95%CI: 1.059–1.150)
for 22°C. Overall, the evidence for an eﬀect modiﬁcation is substantial, with a highly signiﬁcant Wald test
(p-value < 0.001). Latitude explains much of the heterogeneity across regions, with an I2 reduced to 18.7% and
a non-signiﬁcant Cochran Q test (p-value = 0.174). The
bottom panels illustrates the same eﬀect modiﬁcation for

Discussion
In this contribution we describe a method to re-express
the bi-dimensional ﬁt of DLNMs in terms of unidimensional summaries, involving reduced sets of modi-
ﬁed parameters of the basis functions chosen for the space
of predictor or lags. This development, in addition to simplifying the algebraic deﬁnition of the methodology, oﬀers
a more compact description of the bi-dimensional association modelled by DLNMs. In particular, the dimension
of the sets of reduced parameters is usually compatible
with the application of multivariate meta-analytical techniques in a two-stage framework, allowing the analysis
of complex non-linear and delayed associations in multilocation studies.
Previous applications of the two-stage design for multilocation time series studies are based on simpliﬁed functions for modelling the association of interest at the ﬁrst
stage. In particular, the analyses are usually limited to
splines or other non-linear functions of simple moving
average of the exposure series , a modelling approach
similar to the alternative models used for comparison
in our example. Alternatively, the simpliﬁcation could be
applied in the other dimension of predictor, specifying
DLMs for linear or linear-threshold exposure-response
relationships . All these approaches require strong
assumptions on the exposure-response dependency, in
order to simplify the association modelled in one of the
two dimensions within the ﬁrst stage. These are prone

to biases when the true underlying dependency is misspeciﬁed. The framework we propose, in contrast, require
less assumptions or simpliﬁcations regarding the association in the ﬁrst-stage model, but rather reduces the estimates to uni-dimensional summaries of a bi-dimensional
ﬁt. The advantages of this approach are exempliﬁed by
the comparison of the simpler alternatives with the bidimensionally ﬂexible model, illustrated in the Results
section. This methodology oﬀers greater ﬂexibility in the
investigation of complex associations through a two-stage
Most of the limitations of DLNMs and multivariate
meta-analysis of multi-parameter associations, previously
discussed , identically apply to this framework. In
particular, the issues of model selection and control for
confounding pose important challenges, and are matters
of current and future research. The issue of model selection is particularly relevant, due to the bi-dimensional
nature of the models, where two independent bases are
chosen to describe the dependency along predictor and
lag spaces, respectively. In our example, we selected the
bases a-priori for illustrative purposes, but model selection is clearly more problematic in applied analyses.
The problem of estimating perfectly correlated random
components in the second-stage meta-analytical model,
as described in the example, can bias upward the standard
errors of the pooled estimates. This problem occurs in
likelihood-based and method of moments estimation procedures of multivariate meta-analysis, as these estimators
truncate the between-study correlations on the boundary of their parameter space . Although in many
cases this problem arises with small number of studies
or when the amount of heterogeneity is negligible (and
thus when a ﬁxed-eﬀects model is preferable), alternative
approaches may be considered. First, diﬀerent estimation
methods can be applied, for example by imposing some
structure to the between-study (co)variance matrix, or
adopting a Bayesian approach that employ weakly informative priors models could avoid truncation of betweenstudy correlations. Also, alternative parameterization of
the cross-basis functions may reduce the correlation pattern in the ﬁrst stage and avoid estimation problems in the

second-stage multivariate model. This issue needs to be
explored further.
The deﬁnition of identical cross-basis functions in all
the locations can be problematic in the presence of
substantially diﬀerent exposure ranges. In our example,
the temperature distribution was similar across regions,
and the placements of common knots was straightforward. However, this can be hardly generalized. The issue
was previously discussed, and an alternative approach
based on relative scale was proposed for pooling onedimensional functions . The same method is applicable for bi-dimensional DLNMs. However, this limitation
requires further research.
Estimation methods for DLNMs not requiring the
completely parametric approach proposed here seems
attractive and possible, in particular based on penalized likelihood or Bayesian methods . These
estimation procedures also provide automatic selection
methods. These options require the speciﬁcation of a
large number of parameters, which are then shrunk during the ﬁtting procedures to reach a far smaller number
of equivalent df. However, the high dimensionality of the
ﬁtted model may present a problem for the second-stage
multivariate meta-analysis, even when reduced to unidimensional summaries following (4)–(5). Techniques for
meta-analysis of high-dimensional estimates are a topic of
current and future research.
Potentially, the number of parameters of the secondstage multivariate meta-analysis can also be decreased by
structuring the between-study (co)variance matrix of random eﬀects. However, the extent to which such a choice
can bias the estimates of ﬁxed-eﬀects parameters is not
known. Moreover, this option is not yet available in the R
package mvmeta, and will be implemented and assessed
in future analyses.
Conclusions
The extension of the DLNM framework presented here,
involving the reduction of the complex two-dimensional
ﬁt to one-dimensional summaries, provides an improved
method to study complex non-linear and delayed associations in two-stage analyses. Unlike previous approaches
proposed so far, this method requires less simpliﬁcation of
the exposure-response shape or lag structure. This framework may be applied in any setting where non-linear and
delayed relationships needs to be investigated in diﬀerent
populations or groups.
