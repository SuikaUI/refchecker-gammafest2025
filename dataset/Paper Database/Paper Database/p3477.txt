Objective: To analyze and compare the age of data in contemporary research articles published in representative general
radiology journals.
Materials and Methods: We searched for articles reporting original research studies analyzing patient data that were published
in the print issues of the Korean Journal of Radiology (KJR), European Radiology (ER), and Radiology in 2017. Eligible
articles were reviewed to extract data collection period (time from first patient recruitment to last patient follow-up) and
age of data (time between data collection end and publication). The journals were compared in terms of the proportion of
articles reporting the data collection period to the level of calendar month and regarding the age of data.
Results: There were 50, 492, and 254 eligible articles in KJR, ER, and Radiology, respectively. Of these, 44 (88%; 95%
confidence interval [CI]: 75.8–94.8%), 359 (73%; 95% CI: 68.9–76.7%), and 211 (83.1%; 95% CI: 78–87.2%) articles,
respectively, provided enough details of data collection period, revealing a significant difference between ER and Radiology
(p = 0.002). The age of data was significantly greater in KJR (median age: 826 days; range: 299–2843 days) than in ER
(median age: 570 days; range: 56–4742 days; p < 0.001) and Radiology (median age: 618; range: 75–4271 days; p < 0.001).
Conclusion: Korean Journal of Radiology did not fall behind ER or Radiology in reporting of data collection period, but
showed a significantly greater age of data than ER and Radiology, suggesting that KJR should take measures to improve the
timeliness of its data.

information and novel discoveries with professionals of
the relevant specialty. This is critical in medicine, where
the application of new knowledge from journals advances
clinical practice. For this reason, the timeliness of research
data is essential; indeed, some journals provide submitting
authors with specific guidelines in this regard (1). Moreover,
in radiology, data timeliness may be especially important
since the field relies heavily on new technology particularly
digital technology (2-7), which develops and changes faster
than in other disciplines. Thus, the timeliness of data in
radiology journals may be an important indicator of quality
or impact, and the present study analyzed and compared
several representative general radiology journals in terms of
the age of the data published therein.

Study Selection
We analyzed the Korean Journal of Radiology (KJR),
European Radiology (ER), and Radiology, which have the
highest impact factors among general radiology journals
 
according to the 2017 Journal Citation Reports (Clarivate
Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA). We hand-searched the
print issues of the journals published in 2017 (6 issues
of KJR, 12 issues of ER, and 12 issues of Radiology) to
find reports of original research studies that had collected
and analyzed patient data. Experimental studies involving
animals, phantoms, or other laboratory conditions were
excluded. The literature was screened by two board-certified
radiologists, both of whom were proficient in reviewing
radiology research articles.
Data Extraction
Firstly, the eligible articles were reviewed to determine
whether they had stated the start and end of the data
collection period to the level of the calendar month (Fig.
1). The data collection period was defined as the time from
recruitment of the first patient to the latest follow-up of
the study patients, as defined elsewhere (Fig. 1) (8). We
considered month, but not date, as it is rare for published
radiology research studies to report the data collection
period to the level of date. Next, we made a universal
assumption that the start and end dates of the data
collection period fell on the first and last days, respectively,
of the reported months. For example, if the data collection
period ranged from January 2011 to April 2015, the start
and end dates were assumed to be January 01, 2011 and
April 30, 2015, respectively. As most studies only report
the shortest and longest follow-up durations, rather than
the exact follow-up periods of each study participant, the
exact time of each patient’s latest follow-up is rarely given.
Therefore, we determined the time of the latest followup by 1) assuming that the earliest study enrollee had
the longest follow-up and that the last enrollee had the
shortest follow-up, 2) calculating two time points by adding
the longest and shortest follow-up lengths to the start and
end, respectively, of enrollment, and 3) choosing the later
of these two time points. This method gave a reasonable
estimate of the latest follow-up time. Secondly, the type of
study design was determined (retrospective, prospective, or
unclear). Thirdly, the exact date of publication, according
to the time at which the full-text article became available
online, was recorded by referring to the PubMed data of ER
and Radiology, both of which use electronic publication
ahead of print, and through contact with the editorial office
of KJR, which does not use electronic publication ahead of
print. Two board-certified radiologists analyzed the eligible
articles to extract data. When there was ambiguity, a third
reviewer experienced in the relevant methodology was
Outcome Measures and Statistical Analysis
The proportion of articles that revealed the data collection
period to the level of the calendar month was calculated,
along with its 95% confidence interval (CI). The proportion
was compared between journals in a pairwise manner using
Fisher’s exact test: KJR vs. ER, KJR vs. Radiology, and ER
vs. Radiology. In articles that revealed the data collection
period, the age of the research data was calculated as the
time between the end of the data collection period and the
date of publication (Fig. 1). The distribution of the age of
data was checked using a histogram and the Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test, and appropriate summary statistics were
obtained. Next, the age of the data was compared between
journals in the aforementioned pairwise manner using the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. This statistical comparison was
performed across all relevant articles, as well as separately
for prospective and retrospective studies. The threshold
p value for statistical significance was lowered to 0.017
(Bonferroni adjustment) to maintain the overall alpha at 5%
after the three pairwise comparisons were made. Statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows,
version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

In total, 50 KJR (9-58), 492 ER, and 254 Radiology
articles reported original research studies analyzing patient
data. Of these, 44 (88%; 95% CI: 75.8–94.8%) (9, 10,
12-21, 23, 24, 26-32, 34-44, 47-58), 359 (73%; 95%
CI: 68.9–76.7%), and 211 (83.1%; 95% CI: 78–87.2%)
articles, respectively, revealed the start and end of data
collection to the level of calendar month. The point
estimate value of this proportion was slightly larger in
KJR than in ER and Radiology, although the difference was
not statistically significant. In contrast, ER demonstrated
a significantly lower proportion than Radiology in this
regard (Table 1). Further breakdowns according to study
type are also presented in Table 1, and the separate results
from prospective and retrospective studies were mostly

consistent with the overall results.
The age of data (the time between the end of the data
collection period and the date of publication) was skewed
to the left in all three journals (Fig. 2) and was significantly
larger in KJR (median age: 826 days across all relevant
articles) than in ER (median age, 570 days) and Radiology
(median age: 618 days) (Table 2). The difference was more
pronounced when retrospective studies were considered
separately (Table 2).
Discussion
Korean Journal of Radiology seemed not to fall behind
ER and Radiology regarding the proportion of articles that
reported the data collection period, although the results
of prospective studies may be inconclusive because too
few relevant articles were published in KJR (11 articles).
Nonetheless, this result may indicate that the journal
has good quality control in the peer review and editorial
processes. However, the age of data was significantly
greater in KJR than in ER (approximately 8.5-month
difference in median age) and Radiology (approximately
7-month difference in median age). Furthermore, the greater
age of the data was more pronounced when retrospective
studies were considered separately (approximately 13 months
older than in ER and 11 months older than in Radiology). It
is likely that the KJR contains older data because authors
generally submit their manuscripts to higher-ranked journals
first, descending the ranks of journals if their manuscript is
rejected. As a result, lower-ranked journals would naturally
contain older data. The journal impact factors of KJR, ER,
and Radiology for 2017, according to the Journal Citation
Reports (Clarivate Analytics), were 3.072, 4.027, and 7.469,
respectively. This would explain why KJR differs from ER or
Radiology in this regard.
However, there was no significant difference in the age
of data between ER and Radiology, despite the apparent
difference in journal impact factor, perhaps because ER
publishes accepted articles more swiftly than Radiology in
electronic publication format ahead of print publication.
Specifically, in the articles analyzed in the present study,
the median interval between initial electronic publication
and official assignment to a monthly print issue was 225
days (range: 130–316 days) for ER and 138 days (range:
39–244 days) for Radiology.
Korean Journal of Radiology recently assessed the
quality of its research articles in terms of conformity to
the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies
(STARD) 2015 guidelines (59) and the adequacy reporting
reliability analysis for diagnostic tests (60). The current
study revealed another area in which KJR could improve
its quality and impact, and we would even suggest some
specific measures. Firstly, because the age of data in the
KJR differed more markedly from that in ER and Radiology
in retrospective studies than in prospective studies,
the journal could encourage authors to make data as
recent as possible by updating study data in the revision
process. Such an update would be possible in the case of
retrospective studies, although it is likely infeasible in most
prospective studies. Secondly, the journal could further

shorten the time from initial submission to publication by
ensuring more rapid review, allowing electronic publication
before print, and publishing monthly in a smaller volume.
Indeed, bimonthly publication delays those articles that
were early accepted in the 2-month cycle period.
This study had several limitations. Firstly, as studies
generally do not report each individual’s exact followup duration, we assumed that the earliest study enrollee
had the longest follow-up and the latest enrollee had
the shortest follow-up; this may not always have been
the case. However, we believe that this approach gave a
reasonable estimate of the data collection period and was
sufficient to analyze the macroscopic, between-journal
difference. Secondly, one published study (8) defined the
age of data slightly differently from the present study as
the time from the mid-point of the data collection period
to the publication date. This previous study analyzed
prospective randomized trials, wherein their definition
fit better. However, this definition would have been
inappropriate in our study, wherein the majority of studies
analyzed were retrospective. In retrospective studies, a data
collection time extending further into the past may be more
beneficial. However, for the purposes of the present study,
it may have penalized the results, as the data age became
greater. Thirdly, knowledge of the details of any rejections
by other journals (number of rejections, by what journals,
etc.) before submission to KJR would have been helpful in
further understanding the greater age of KJR data. However,
we empirically found that it was difficult to collect such
“sensitive” information with consistency.
In conclusion, KJR did not fall behind ER or Radiology
with regard to the proportion of articles that reported the
age of data. However, the age of data was significantly
greater in KJR than in ER and Radiology, suggesting that
the journal should introduce some measures to improve the
timeliness of data that it publishes.
