The Contestation of Tech Ethics: A Sociotechnical Approach to
Technology Ethics in Practice
Ben Green*
Abstract: This article introduces the special issue “Technology Ethics in Action: Critical and
Interdisciplinary Perspectives”. In response to recent controversies about the harms of digital technology,
discourses and practices of “tech ethics” have proliferated across the tech industry, academia, civil society, and
government. Yet despite the seeming promise of ethics, tech ethics in practice suffers from several significant
limitations: tech ethics is vague and toothless, has a myopic focus on individual engineers and technology
design, and is subsumed into corporate logics and incentives. These limitations suggest that tech ethics enables
corporate “ethics-washing”: embracing the language of ethics to defuse criticism and resist government
regulation, without committing to ethical behavior. Given these dynamics, I describe tech ethics as a terrain of
contestation where the central debate is not whether ethics is desirable, but what “ethics” entails and who gets
to define it. Current approaches to tech ethics are poised to enable technologists and technology companies to
label themselves as “ethical” without substantively altering their practices. Thus, those striving for structural
improvements in digital technologies must be mindful of the gap between ethics as a mode of normative inquiry
and ethics as a practical endeavor. In order to better evaluate the opportunities and limits of tech ethics, I propose
a sociotechnical approach that analyzes tech ethics in light of who defines it and what impacts it generates in
Key words: technology ethics; AI ethics; ethics-washing; Science, Technology, and Society (STS);

1 Introduction: A Crisis of Conscience
If digital technology production in the beginning of the
2010s was characterized by the brash spirit of Facebook’s
motto “move fast and break things” and the superficial
assurances of Google’s motto “do not be evil”, digital
technology toward the end of the decade was
characterized by a “crisis of conscience” . While many
have long been aware of digital technology’s harms, an
influx of stories about salient harms led to widespread
critique of digital technology. The response was the
“techlash”: a growing public animosity toward major
technology companies. In 2018, Oxford Dictionaries
and the Financial Times both deemed techlash to be one
of the words of the year .
Consider just a few of the controversies that prompted
this crisis of conscience within tech and the associated
Disinformation:
Throughout
presidential election between Donald Trump and Hillary
Clinton, social media was plagued with fraudulent
stories that went viral . In turn, numerous
commentators—including
Clinton—blamed
Facebook for Donald Trump’s presidential election
victory[6−9]. Later reporting revealed that Facebook’s
leadership has actively resisted taking strong measures
to curb disinformation, instead prioritizing the company’s
business strategies .

and The Guardian reported that the voter-profiling firm
Cambridge Analytica had harvested information from
millions of Facebook users, without their knowledge or
permission, in order to target political ads for Donald
Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign . Cambridge
Analytica had acquired these data by exploiting the sievelike nature of Facebook’s privacy policy.
Military and ICE Contracts: In 2018, journalists
revealed that Google was working with the US
Department of Defense (DoD) to develop software that
analyzes drone footage . This effort, known as Project
Maven, was part of a ＄7.4 billion investment in AI by
the DoD in 2017 and represented an opportunity for
Google to gain billions of dollars in future defense
contracts . Another story revealed that Palantir was
developing software for Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) to facilitate deportations .
Algorithmic Bias: In 2016, ProPublica revealed that
an algorithm used in criminal courts was biased against
Black defendants, mislabeling them as future criminals
at twice the rates of white defendants . Through
popular books about the harms and biases of algorithms
in settings such as child welfare, online search, and
hiring[18−20], the public began to recognize algorithms as
both fallible and discriminatory.
These and other tech-related controversies were a
shock to many, as they arrived in an era of widespread
(elite) optimism about the beneficence of technology.
Yet these controversies also brought public attention to
what scholars in fields such as Science, Technology, and
Society (STS), philosophy of science, critical data and
algorithm studies, and law have long argued: technology
is shaped by social forces, technology structures society
often in deleterious ways, and technology cannot solve
every social problem. Broadly speaking, these fields
“sociotechnical”
technologies, analyzing how technologies shape, are
shaped by, and interact with society[21−24]. As tech
scandals mounted, a variety of sociotechnical insights,
long ignored by most technologists and journalists, were
newly recognized (or in some form recreated).
Many in the tech sector and academia saw the harms
of digital technology as the result of an inattention to
ethics. On this view, unethical technologies result from
a lack of training in ethical reasoning for engineers
and a dearth of ethical principles in engineering
practice[1, 25−28]. In response, academics, technologists,
companies, governments, and more have embraced a
broad set of goals often characterized with the label “tech
ethics”: the introduction of ethics into digital technology
education, research, development, use, and governance.
In the span of just a few years, tech ethics has become
technology
companies, academia, civil society organizations, and
governments.
This article reviews the growth of tech ethics and the
debates that this growth has prompted. I first describe the
primary forms of tech ethics in practice. I focus on the
people and organizations that explicitly embrace the
label of “tech ethics” (and closely related labels, such as
AI ethics and algorithmic fairness). I then summarize the
central critiques made against these efforts, which call
into question the effects and desirability of tech ethics.
Against the backdrop of these critiques, I argue that tech
ethics is a terrain of contestation: the central debate is not
whether ethics is desirable but what ethics entails and
who has the authority to define it. These debates suggest
the need for a sociotechnical approach to tech ethics that
focuses on the social construction and real-world effects
of tech ethics, disambiguating between the value of
ethics as a discipline and the limits of tech ethics as a
practical endeavor. I introduce this approach through
four frames: objectivity and neutrality, determinism,
solutionism, and sociotechnical systems.
2 The Rise of Tech Ethics
Although some scholars, activists, and others have long
considered the ethics of technology, attention to digital
technology ethics has rapidly grown across the tech
industry, academia, civil society, and government in
recent years. As we will see, tech ethics typically
involves applied forms of ethics such as codes of ethics
and research ethics, rather than philosophical inquiry
(i.e., moral philosophy). For instance, one common
treatment of tech ethics is statements of ethical principles.
One analysis of 36 prominent AI principles documents
shows the sharp rise in these statements, from 2 in 2014
to 16 in 2018 . These documents tend to cover the
themes of fairness and non-discrimination, privacy,
accountability, and transparency and explainability .
Many documents also reference human rights, with
some taking international human rights as the
framework for ethics .
Journal of Social Computing, September 2021, 2(3): 209−225
2.1 Tech industry
The most pervasive treatment of tech ethics within tech
companies has come in the form of ethics principles and
ethics oversight bodies. Companies like Microsoft,
Google, and IBM have developed and publicly shared
AI ethics principles, which include statements such as
“AI systems should treat all people fairly” and “AI
should be socially beneficial”[30−32]. These principles are
often supported through dedicated ethics teams and
advisory boards within companies, with such bodies in
place at companies including Microsoft, Google,
Facebook, DeepMind, and Axon[33−37]. Companies such
as Google and Accenture have also begun offering tech
ethics consulting services .
As part of these efforts, the tech industry has formed
several coalitions aimed at promoting safe and ethical
artificial intelligence. In 2015, Elon Musk and Sam
Altman created OpenAI, a research organization that
aims to mitigate the “existential threat” presented by AI,
with more than ＄1 billion in donations from major tech
executives and companies . A year later, Amazon,
Facebook, DeepMind, IBM, and Microsoft founded the
Partnership on AI (PAI), a nonprofit coalition to shape
best practices in AI development, advance public
understanding of AI, and support socially beneficial
applications of AI .①
2.2 Academia
Computer and information science programs at
universities have rapidly increased their emphasis on
ethics training. While some universities have taught
computing ethics courses for many years[44−46], the
emphasis on ethics within computing education has
increased dramatically in recent years . One
crowdsourced list of tech ethics classes contains more
than 300 courses . This plethora of courses represents
a dramatic shift in computer science training and culture,
with ethics becoming a popular topic of discussion and
study after being largely ignored by the mainstream of
the field just a few years prior.
Research in computer science and related fields has
also become more focused on the ethics and social
impacts of computing. This trend is observable in the
recent increase in conferences and workshops related to
computing ethics. The ACM Conference on Fairness,
Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT) and the
AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society
(AIES) both held their first annual meetings in February
2018 and have since grown rapidly. There have been
several dozen workshops related to fairness and ethics
at major computer science conferences . Many
universities have supported these efforts by creating
institutes focused on the social implications of
technology. 2017 alone saw the launch of the AI Now
Institute at NYU , the Princeton Dialogues on AI and
Ethics , and the MIT/Harvard Ethics and Governance
of Artificial Intelligence Initiative . More recently
Computing ; the Stanford Institute for Human-
Centered Artificial Intelligence ; and the University of
Michigan Center of Ethics, Society, and Computing .
2.3 Civil society
Numerous civil society organizations have coalesced
around tech ethics, with strategies that include
grantmaking and developing principles. Organizations
such as the MacArthur and Ford Foundations have begun
exploring and making grants in tech ethics . For
instance, the Omidyar Network, Mozilla Foundation,
Schmidt Futures, and Craig Newmark Philanthropies
partnered on the Responsible Computer Science
Challenge, which awarded ＄3.5 million between 2018
and 2020 to support efforts to embed ethics into
undergraduate computer science education . Many
foundations also contribute to the research, conferences,
and institutes that have emerged in recent years.
Other organizations have been created or have
expanded their scope to consider the implications and
governance of digital technologies. For example, the
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has begun
hiring technologists and is increasingly engaged in
debates and legislation related to new technology.
Organizations such as Data & Society, Upturn, the
Center for Humane Technology, and Tactical Tech study
the social implications of technology and advocate for
improved technology governance and design practices.
Many in civil society call for engineers to follow an
ethical oath modeled after the Hippocratic Oath (an
ethical oath taken by physicians)[20, 58−60]. In 2018, for
instance, the organization Data for Democracy partnered
① Although PAI also includes civil society partners, these
organizations do not appear to have significant influence. In 2020, the
human rights organization Access Now resigned from PAI, explaining
that “there is an increasingly smaller role for civil society to play within
PAI” and that “we did not find that PAI influenced or changed the attitude
of member companies” .
Ben Green:   The Contestation of Tech Ethics: A Sociotechnical Approach to Technology Ethics in Practice
with Bloomberg and the data platform provider
BrightHive to develop a code of ethics for data scientists,
developing 20 principles that include “I will respect
human dignity” and “It is my responsibility to increase
social benefit while minimizing harm” . Former US
Chief Data Scientist DJ Patil described the event as the
“Constitutional Convention” for data science . A
related effort, produced by the Institute for the Future
and the Omidyar Network, is the Ethical OS Toolkit, a
set of prompts and checklists to help technology
developers “anticipate the future impact of today’s
technology” and “not regret the things you will build” .
2.4 Government
Many governments developed commissions and
principles dedicated to tech ethics. In the United States,
for example, the National Science Foundation formed a
Council for Big Data, Ethics, and Society ; the
National Science and Technology Council published a
report about AI that emphasized ethics ; and the
Department of Defense adopted ethical principles for
AI . Elsewhere, governing bodies in Dubai ,
Europe , Japan , and Mexico , as well as
international organizations such as the OECD , have
all stated principles for ethical AI.
3 The Limits of Tech Ethics
Alongside its rapid growth, tech ethics has been
critiqued along several lines. First, the principles
espoused by tech ethics statements are too abstract and
toothless to reliably spur ethical behavior in practice.
Second, by emphasizing the design decisions of
individual engineers, tech ethics overlooks the structural
forces that shape technology’s harmful social impacts.
Third, as ethics is incorporated into tech companies,
ethical ideals are subsumed into corporate logics and
incentives. Collectively, these issues suggest that tech
ethics represents a strategy of technology companies
“ethics-washing” their behavior with a façade of ethics
while largely continuing with business-as-usual.
3.1 Tech ethics principles are abstract and toothless
Tech ethics codes deal in broad principles . In 2016,
for example, Accenture published a report explicitly
outlining “a universal code of data ethics” . A 2019
analysis of global AI ethics guidelines found 84 such
documents, espousing a common set of broad principles:
transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence,
responsibility, and privacy . Professional computing
societies also present ethical commitments in a highly
abstract form, encouraging computing professionals “to
be ever aware of the social, economic, cultural, and
political impacts of their actions” and to “contribute to
society and human well-being” . Ethics codes in
computing and information science are notably lacking
in explicit commitments to normative principles .
The emphasis on universal principles papers over the
fault lines of debate and disagreement spurred the
emergence of tech ethics in the first place. Tech ethics
principles embody a remarkable level of agreement: two
2019 reports on global AI ethics guidelines noted a
“global convergence” and a “consensus” in the
principles espoused. Although these documents tend to
reflect a common set of global principles, the actual
interpretation and implementation of these principles
raise substantive conflicts . Furthermore, these
principles have been primarily developed in the US and
UK, with none from Africa or South America . The
superficial consensus around abstract ideals may thus
hinder substantive deliberation regarding whether the
chosen values are appropriate, how those values should
be balanced in different contexts, and what those values
actually entail in practice.
The abstraction of tech ethics is particularly troubling
due to a lack of mechanisms to enact or enforce the
espoused principles. When framed at such a high level
of abstraction, values such as fairness and respect are
unable to guide specific actions . In companies, ethics
oversight boards and ethics principles lack the authority
to veto projects or require certain behaviors .
Similarly, professional computing organizations such as
the IEEE and ACM lack the power to meaningfully
sanction individuals who violate their codes of ethics .
Moreover, unlike fields such as medicine, which has a
strong and established emphasis on professional ethics,
computing lacks a common aim or fiduciary duty to
unify disparate actors around shared ethical practices .
All told, “Principles alone cannot guarantee ethical
3.2 Tech ethics has a myopic focus on individual
engineers and technology design
Tech ethics typically emphasizes the roles and
responsibilities of engineers, paying relatively little
attention to the broader environments in which these
Journal of Social Computing, September 2021, 2(3): 209−225
individuals work. Although professional codes in
commitments to the public, profession, and one’s
employer, “the morality of a profession’s or an employer’s
motives are not scrutinized” . Similarly, ethics within
computer science curricula tends to focus on ethical
decision making for individual engineers .
From this individualistic frame comes an emphasis on
appealing to the good intentions of engineers, with the
assumption that better design practices and procedures
will lead to better technology. Ethics becomes a matter
of individual engineers and managers “doing the right
thing” “for the right reasons” . Efforts to provide
ethical guidance for tech CEOs rest on a similar logic:
“if a handful of people have this much power—if they
can, simply by making more ethical decisions, cause
billions of users to be less addicted and isolated and
confused and miserable—then, is not that worth a
shot?” . The broader public beyond technical experts is
not seen as having a role in defining ethical concerns or
shaping the responses to these concerns .
Tech ethics therefore centers debates about how to
build better technology rather than whether or in what
form to build technology (let alone who gets to make
such decisions). Tech ethics follows the assumption that
artificial intelligence and machine learning are
“inevitable”, such that “‘better building’ is the only
ethical path forward” . In turn, tech ethics efforts
pursue technical and procedural solutions for the
consequences
technology .
Following this logic, tech companies have developed
numerous ethics and fairness toolkits[80−84].
Although efforts to improve the design decisions of
individual engineers can be beneficial, the focus on
individual design choices relies on a narrow theory of
change for how to reform technology. Regardless of
their intentions and the design frameworks at their
disposal, individual engineers typically have little power
to shift corporate strategy. Executives can prevent
engineers from understanding the full scope of their
work, limiting knowledge and internal dissent about
controversial projects . Even when engineers do
know about and protest projects, the result is often them
resigning or being replaced rather than the company
changing course . The most notable improvements
in technology use and regulation have come from
collective action among activists, tech workers,
journalists, and scholars, rather than individual design
efforts .
More broadly, the emphasis on design ignores the
structural sources of technological harms. The injustices
associated with digital technologies result from
business models that rely on collecting massive amounts
of data about the public ; companies that wield
monopolistic power ; technologies that are built
through the extraction of natural resources and the abuse
of workers[93−96]; and the exclusion of women,
minorities, and non-technical experts from technology
design and governance .
These structural conditions place significant barriers
on the extent to which design-oriented tech ethics can
guide efforts to achieve reform. As anthropologist Susan
Silbey notes, “while we might want to acknowledge
human agency and decision-making at the heart of
ethical action, we blind ourselves to the structure of those
choices—incentives, content, and pattern—if we focus
too closely on the individual and ignore the larger pattern
of opportunities and motives that channel the actions we
call ethics” . To the extent that it defines ethical
technology in terms of individual design decisions, tech
ethics will divert scrutiny away from the economic and
political factors that drive digital injustice, limiting our
ability to address these forces.
3.3 Tech ethics is subsumed into corporate logics
and incentives
Digital technology companies have embraced ethics as
a matter of corporate concern, aiming to present the
appearance of ethical behavior for scrutinizing
audiences. As Alphabet and Microsoft noted in recent
SEC filings, products that are deemed unethical could
lead to reputational and financial harms . Companies
are eager to avoid any backlash, yet do not want to
jeopardize their business plans. An ethnography of
ethics work in Silicon Valley found that “performing, or
even showing off, the seriousness with which a company
takes ethics becomes a more important sign of ethical
practices than real changes to a product” . For instance,
after an effort at Twitter to reduce online harassment
stalled, an external researcher involved in the effort
noted, “The impression I came away with from this
experience is that Twitter was more sensitive to
deflecting criticism than in solving the problem of
harassment” .
Ben Green:   The Contestation of Tech Ethics: A Sociotechnical Approach to Technology Ethics in Practice
Corporate tech ethics is therefore framed in terms of its
direct alignment with business strategy. A software
engineer at LinkedIn described algorithmic fairness as
being profitable for companies, arguing, “If you are very
biased, you might only cater to one population, and
eventually that limits the growth of your user base, so
from a business perspective you actually want to have
everyone come on board, so it is actually a good business
decision in the long run” . Similarly, one of the people
behind the Ethical OS toolkit described being motivated
to produce “a tool that helps you think through societal
consequences and makes sure what you are designing is
good for the world and good for your longer-term bottom
line” .
Finding this alignment between ethics and business is
an important task for those charged with promoting
ethics in tech companies. Recognizing that “market
success trumps ethics”, individuals focused on ethics in
Silicon Valley feel pressure to align ethical principles
with corporate revenue sources . As one senior
researcher in a tech company notes, “the ethics system
that you create has to be something that people feel adds
value and is not a massive roadblock that adds no value,
because if it is a roadblock that has no value, people
literally will not do it, because they do not have to” .
When ethical ideals are at odds with a company’s bottom
line, they are met with resistance .
This emphasis on business strategy creates significant
conflicts with ethics. Corporate business models often
rely on extractive and exploitative practices, leading to
many of the controversies at the heart of the techlash.
disinformation have led Facebook and Twitter stock
values to decline rapidly . Thus, even as tech
companies espouse a devotion to ethics, they continue to
develop products and services that raise ethical red flags
but promise significant profits. For example, even after
releasing AI ethics principles that include safety, privacy,
and inclusiveness and committing not to “deploy
facial recognition technology in scenarios that we
believe will put democratic freedoms at risk” ,
Microsoft invested in AnyVision, an Israeli facial
recognition company that supports military surveillance
of Palestinians in the West Bank . Similarly, several
years after Google withdrew from Project Maven due to
ethical concerns among employees, and then created AI
ethics guidelines, the company began aggressively
pursuing new contracts with the Department of
Defense .
In sum, tech ethics is being subsumed into existing
tech company logics and business practices rather than
changing those logics and practices (even if some
individuals within companies do want to create
meaningful change). This absorption allows companies
to take up the mantle of ethics without making
substantive changes to their processes or business
strategies. The goal in companies is to find practices
“which the organization is not yet doing but is capable
of doing” , indicating an effort to find relatively
costless reforms that provide the veneer of ethical
behavior. Ethics statements “co-opt the language of
some critics”, taking critiques grounded in a devotion to
equity and social justice and turning them into principles
akin to “conventional business ethics” . As they adopt
these principles, tech companies “are learning to speak
and perform ethics rather than make the structural
changes necessary to achieve the social values
underpinning the ethical fault lines that exist” .
These limits to corporate tech ethics are exemplified
by Google’s firings of Timnit Gebru and Meg Mitchell.
Despite Gebru’s and Mitchell’s supposed charge as coleads of Google’s Ethical AI team, Google objected to
a paper they had written (alongside several internal and
external co-authors) about the limitations and harms of
large language models, which are central to Google’s
business . Google attempted to force the authors to
retract the paper, claiming that they failed to
acknowledge recent technical advances that mitigate
many of the paper’s concerns . Soon after, journalists
revealed that this incident reflected a larger pattern:
Google had expanded its review of papers that discuss
“sensitive topics”, telling researchers, for instance, to
“take great care to strike a positive tone” regarding
Google’s technologies and products . Thus, even as
Google publicly advertised its care for ethics, internally
the company was carefully reviewing research to curtail
ethical criticisms that it deemed threatening to its core
business interests.
3.4 Tech ethics has become an avenue for ethicswashing
As evidence of tech ethics’ limitations has grown, many
have critiqued tech ethics as a strategic effort among
technology companies to maintain autonomy and profits.
Journal of Social Computing, September 2021, 2(3): 209−225
This strategy has been labeled “ethics-washing” (i.e.,
“ethical white-washing”): adopting the language of
ethics to diminish public scrutiny and avoid regulations
that would require substantive concessions[110−112]. As
an ethnography of ethics in Silicon Valley found, “It is
a routine experience at ‘ethics’ events and workshops in
Silicon Valley to hear ethics framed as a form of selfregulation necessary to stave off increased governmental
regulation” . This suggests that the previously
described issues with tech ethics might be features rather
than bugs: by focusing public attention on the actions of
individual engineers and on technical dilemmas (such as
algorithmic bias), companies perform a sleight-of-hand
that shifts structural questions about power and profit out
of view. Companies can paint a self-portrait of ethical
behavior without meaningfully altering their practices.
Thomas Metzinger, a philosopher who served on the
European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group on
Artificial
Intelligence
particularly striking account of ethics-washing in
action . The AI HLEG contained only four ethicists
out of 52 total people and was dominated by
representatives from industry. Metzinger was tasked
with developing “Red Lines” that AI applications should
not cross. However, the proposed red lines were
ultimately removed by industry representatives eager for
a “positive vision” for AI. All told, Metzinger describes
the AI HLEG’s guidelines as “lukewarm, short-sighted,
and deliberately vague” and concludes that the tech
industry is “using ethics debates as elegant public
decorations for a large-scale investment strategy” .
Tech companies have further advanced this “ethicswashing” agenda through funding academic research
and conferences. Many of the scholars writing about tech
policy and ethics are funded by Google, Microsoft, and
other companies, yet often do not disclose this
funding . Tech companies also provide funding
for prominent academic conferences, including the
ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and
Transparency (FAccT); the AAAI/ACM Conference on
Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, and Society (AIES); and
the Privacy Law Scholars Conference (PLSC). Even if
these funding practices do not directly influence the
research output of individual scholars, they allow tech
companies to shape the broader academic and public
discourse regarding tech ethics, raising certain voices
and conversations at the expense of others.②
In December 2019, then-MIT graduate student
Rodrigo Ochigame provided a particularly pointed
ethics-washing .
Describing
experiences working in the Media Lab’s AI ethics group
and collaborating with the Partnership on AI, Ochigame
articulated how “the discourse of ‘ethical AI’ was
aligned strategically with a Silicon Valley effort seeking
to avoid legally enforceable restrictions of controversial
technologies”. Ochigame described witnessing firsthand
how the Partnership on AI made recommendations that
“aligned consistently with the corporate agenda” by
reducing political questions about the criminal justice
system to matters of technical consideration. A central
part of this effort was tech companies strategically
funding researchers and conferences in order to generate
a widespread discourse about “ethical” technology.
Finding that “the corporate lobby’s effort to shape
successful”,
Ochigame concluded that “big tech money and direction
proved incompatible with an honest exploration of
Ochigame’s article prompted heated debate about the
value and impacts of tech ethics. Some believed that
oversimplified
acknowledge the many people behind tech ethics[120−122].
On this view, tech ethics is a broad movement that
includes efforts by scholars and activists to expose and
resist technological harms. Yet many of the people
centrally involved in those efforts see their work as
distinct from tech ethics. Safiya Noble described
Ochigame’s article as “All the way correct and worth the
time to read” . Lilly Irani and Ruha Benjamin
expressed similar sentiments, noting that “AI ethics is
not a movement” and that “many of us do not frame
our work as ‘ethical AI’” . On this view, tech ethics
represents the narrow domain of efforts, typically
promulgated by tech companies, that explicitly embrace
the label of “tech ethics”.
The debate over Ochigame’s article exposed the fault
lines at the heart of tech ethics. The central question is
what tech ethics actually entails in practice. While some
frame tech ethics as encompassing broad societal
debates about the social impacts of technology, others
define tech ethics as narrower industry-led efforts to
② The integrity of academic tech ethics has been further called into
companies[115−117]. A related critique of academic tech ethics institutes is
the lack of diversity within their leadership .
Ben Green:   The Contestation of Tech Ethics: A Sociotechnical Approach to Technology Ethics in Practice
explicitly promote “ethics” in technology. On the former
view, tech ethics is an important and beneficial
movement for improving digital technology. On the
latter view, tech ethics is a distraction that hinders efforts
to achieve more equitable technology.
4 The Contestation of Tech Ethics
The debates described in the previous section reveal that
the central question regarding tech ethics is not whether
it is desirable to be ethical, but what “ethics” entails and
who gets to define it. Although the label of ethics carries
connotations of moral philosophy, in practice the
“ethics” in tech ethics tends to take on four overlapping
yet often conflicting definitions: moral justice, corporate
values, legal risk, and compliance . With all of these
meanings conflated in the term ethics, superficially
similar calls for tech ethics can imply distinct and even
contradictory goals. There is a significant gap between
the potential benefits of applying ethics (as in rigorous
normative reasoning) to technology and the real-world
effects of applying ethics (as in narrow and corporatedriven principles) to technology.
As a result, tech ethics represents a terrain of
contestation. The contestation of tech ethics centers on
certain actors attempting to claim legitimate authority
over what it means for technology to be “ethical”, at the
expense of other actors. These practices of “boundarywork” enable engineers and companies to maintain
intellectual authority and professional autonomy, often
in ways that exclude women, minorities, the Global
South, and other publics[128−130]. We can see this
behavior in technology companies projecting procedural
toolkits as solutions to ethical dilemmas, computer
scientists
mathematical metrics, academic tech ethics institutes
being funded by billionaires and led primarily by white
men, and tech ethics principles being disseminated
predominantly by the US and Western Europe.
Furthermore, many of the most prominent voices
regarding tech ethics are white men who claim expertise
while ignoring the work of established fields and
scholars, many of whom are women and people of
color .
Two examples of how ethics has been implemented in
other domains—science and business—shed light on the
stakes of present debates about tech ethics.
4.1 Ethics in science
Many areas of science have embraced ethics in recent
decades following public concerns about the social
implications of emerging research and applications.
Despite the seeming promise of science ethics, however,
existing approaches fail to raise debates about the
structure of scientific research or to promote democratic
governance of science.
Rather than interrogating fundamental questions
about the purposes of research or who gets to shape
increasingly
institutionalized, instrumentalized, and professionalized,
with an emphasis on filling out forms and checking off
boxes . Science ethics bodies suffer from limited
“ethical imaginations” and are often primarily
concerned with “keeping the wheels of research turning
while satisfying publics that ethical standards are being
met” . “Ethical analysis that does not advance such
instrumental purposes tends to be downgraded as not
worthy of public support” .
In turn, “systems of ethics play key roles in eliding
fundamental social and political issues” related to
scientific research . For instance, efforts to introduce
ethics into genetic research throughout the 1990s and
2000s treated ethics “as something that could be added
onto science—and not something that was unavoidably
implicit in it” . The effort to treat ethics as an add-on
obscured how “ethical choices inhered in efforts to study
human genetic variation, regardless of any explicit effort
to practice ethics” . As a result, these research
projects “bypassed responsibility for their roles in coconstituting natural and moral orderings of human
difference, despite efforts to address ethics at the earliest
stages of research design” .
The turn to ethics can also entail an explicit effort
among scientists to defuse external scrutiny and to
develop a regime of self-governance. In the 1970s,
frightened by calls for greater public participation in
genetic engineering, biologists organized a conference
at the Asilomar Conference Center in California . The
scientific community at Asilomar pursued two,
intertwined goals. First, to present a unified and
responsible public image, the Asilomar organizers
restricted the agenda to eschew discussions of the most
controversial applications of genetic engineering
(biological warfare and human genetic engineering).
Journal of Social Computing, September 2021, 2(3): 209−225
Second, to convince the American public and politicians
that allow biologists could self-govern genetic
engineering research, the Asilomar attendees “redefined
the genetic engineering problem as a technical one” that
only biologists could credibly discuss . Although
Asilomar is often hailed as a remarkable occasion of
scientific self-sacrifice for the greater good, accounts
from the conference itself present a different account.
“Self-interest, not altruism, was most evident at
Asilomar”, as not making any sacrifices and appearing
self-serving would have invited stringent, external
regulation .
Tech ethics mirrors many of these attributes in
scientific ethics. As with ethics in other fields of
science, tech ethics involves a significant emphasis on
institutionalized design practices, often entailing
checklists and worksheets. Mirroring ethics in genetic
research, the emphasis on ethical design treats ethics as
something that can be added on to digital technologies
by individual engineers, overlooking the epistemologies
and economic structures that shape these technologies
and their harms. Just like the molecular biologists at
Asilomar, tech companies and computer scientists are
defining moral questions as technical challenges in order
to retain authority and autonomy.③ The removal of red
lines in the European Commission’s High-Level Expert
Group on AI resembles the exclusion of controversial
topics from the agenda at Asilomar.
4.2 Corporate ethics and co-optation
Codes of ethics have long been employed by groups of
experts (e.g., doctors and lawyers) to codify a profession’s
expected behavior and to shore up the profession’s
public reputation . Similarly, companies across a
wide range of sectors have embraced ethics codes,
typically in response to public perceptions of unethical
behavior .
Yet it has long been clear that the public benefits of
corporate ethics codes are minimal. While ethics codes
can help make a group appear ethical, they do little to
promote a culture of ethical behavior . The primary
goal of business ethics has instead been the “inherently
unethical” motivation of corporate self-preservation: to
reduce public and regulatory scrutiny by promoting a
visible appearance of ethical behavior . Ethics
codes promote corporate reputation and profit by
making universal moral claims that “are extremely
important as claims but extremely vague as rules” and
emphasizing individual actors and behaviors, leading to
a narrow, “one-case-at-a-time approach to control and
discipline” . Ethics codes in the field of information
systems have long exhibited a notable lack of explicit
moral obligations for computing professionals .
Business ethics is indicative of the broader
phenomenon of co-optation: an institution incorporating
elements of external critiques from groups such as social
movements—often gaining the group’s support and
institution’s
image—without
meaningfully
decision-making
authority[142−144]. The increasing centrality of companies
as the target of social movements has led to a particular
form of co-optation called “corporatization”, in which
“corporate interests come to engage with ideas and
practices initiated by a social movement and, ultimately,
to significantly shape discourses and practices initiated
by the movement” . Through this process, large
corporate actors in the United States have embraced
“diluted and deradicalized” elements of social
movements “that could be scaled up and adapted for
mass markets” . Two factors make movements

heterogeneity (movement factions that are willing to

technological “fixes”). By participating in movementinitiated discourses, companies are able to present
themselves as part of the solution rather than part of the
problem, and in doing so can avoid more restrictive
government regulations.
Tech ethics closely resembles corporate ethics.
Abstract and individualized tech ethics codes reproduce
the virtue signaling and self-preservation behind
traditional business ethics. In a notable example of cooptation and corporatization, technology companies
have promoted tech ethics as a diluted and commoditized
version of tech-critical discourses that originated among
activists, journalists, and critical scholars. Because
societal efforts to improve technology are often aimed
at companies and include both heterogeneity and
materiality,

corporatization.
corporatization,
companies use ethics to present themselves as part of the
solution rather than part of the problem and use funding
to empower the voices of certain scholars and academic
communities. In doing so, tech companies shore up their
reputation and hinder external regulation. The success
of tech ethics corporatization can be seen in the
expanding scope of work that is published and discussed
under the banner of “tech ethics”. Even scholars who do
not embrace the tech ethics label are increasingly
subsumed into this category, either lumped into it by
others or compelled into it as opportunities to publish
research, impact policymakers, and receive grants are
increasingly shifting to the terrain of “tech ethics”.
4.3 The stakes of tech ethics
These examples of ethics in science and business suggest
two conclusions about tech ethics. First, tech ethics
technologists
technology
companies to label themselves as “ethical” without
substantively altering their practices. Tech ethics
follows the model of science ethics and business ethics,
which present case studies for how ethics-washing can
stymie democratic debate and oversight. Continuing the
process already underway, tech companies and
technologists are poised to define themselves as “ethical”
even while continuing to generate significant social
harm. Although some individuals and groups are
pursuing expansive forms of tech ethics, tech companies
have sufficient influence to promote their narrow vision
of “tech ethics” as the dominant understanding and
implementation.
Second, those striving for substantive and structural
improvements in digital technologies must be mindful
of the gap between ethics as normative inquiry and ethics
as a practical endeavor. Moral philosophy is essential to
studying and improving technology, suggesting that
ethics is inherently desirable. However, the examples of
ethics in technology, science, and business indicate that
ethics in practical contexts can be quite distinct from
ethics as a mode of moral reasoning. It is necessary to
recognize these simultaneous and conflicting roles of
ethics. Defenders of ethics-as-moral-philosophy must be
mindful not to inadvertently legitimize ethics-assuperficial-practice when asserting the importance of
ethics. Meanwhile, critics who would cede ethics to tech
companies and engineers as a denuded concept should
be mindful that ethics-as-moral-philosophy has much to
offer their own critiques of ethics-as-superficial-practice.
Attending to these porous and slippery boundaries is
essential for supporting efforts to resist oppressive
digital technologies. As indicated by the responses
to Ochigame’s critique of ethics-washing, many of
the more radical critics of digital technology see
themselves as outside of—if not in opposition to—the
dominant strains of tech ethics. Activists, communities,
and scholars have developed alternative discourses
practices:
refusal[85,
resistance ,
defense , abolition , and decentering
technology . Although some may see these
alternative movements as falling under the broad
umbrella of tech ethics, they embody distinct aspirations
from the narrow mainstream of tech ethics. Labeling
these burgeoning practices as part of tech ethics risks
giving tech ethics the imprimatur of radical, justiceoriented work even as its core tenets and practices
eschew such commitments.
5 A Sociotechnical Approach to Tech Ethics
Rather than presenting a unifying and beneficent set of
principles and practices, tech ethics has emerged as a
central site of struggle regarding the future of digital
architectures, governance, and economies. Given these
dynamics of contestation surrounding tech ethics, ethics
will not, on its own, provide a salve for technology’s
social harms. In order to better evaluate the opportunities
and limits of tech ethics, it is necessary to shift our focus
from the value of ethics in theory to the impacts of ethics
in practice.
This task calls for analyzing tech ethics through a
sociotechnical lens. A sociotechnical approach to
technology emphasizes that artifacts cannot be analyzed
in isolation. Instead, it is necessary to focus on
technology’s social impacts and on how artifacts shape
and are shaped by society. Similarly, a sociotechnical
approach to tech ethics emphasizes that tech ethics
cannot be analyzed in isolation. Instead, it is necessary
to focus on the social impacts of tech ethics and on how
tech ethics shapes and is shaped by society. If
“technologies can be assessed only in their relations to
the sites of their production and use” , then so too, we
might say, tech ethics can be assessed only in relation to
the sites of its conception and use. With this aim in mind,
it is fruitful to consider tech ethics through the lens of
Journal of Social Computing, September 2021, 2(3): 209−225
four sociotechnical frames: objectivity and neutrality,
determinism, solutionism, and sociotechnical systems.
5.1 Objectivity and neutrality
A sociotechnical lens on technology sheds light on how
scientists and engineers are not objective and on how
technologies are not neutral. It makes clear that
improving digital technologies requires grappling with
commitments
incorporating more voices into the design of
technology . Similarly, it is necessary to
recognize that the actors promoting tech ethics are not
objective and that tech ethics is not neutral. Currently,
the range of perspectives reflected in ethics principles is
quite narrow and ethics is treated as an objective,
universal body of principles . In many cases,
white and male former technology company employees
are cast to the front lines of public influence regarding
tech ethics . As a result, the seeming consensus
around particular ethical principles may say less about
the objective universality of these ideals than about the
narrow range of voices that influence tech ethics. Thus,
rather than treating tech ethics as a body of objective and
universal moral principles, it is necessary to grapple with
the standpoints and power of different actors, the
normative principles embodied in different ethical
frameworks, and potential mechanisms for adjudicating
between conflicting ethical commitments.
5.2 Determinism
A central component of a sociotechnical approach to
technology is rejecting technological determinism: the
belief that technology evolves autonomously and
determines
outcomes[155,
Scholarship
demonstrates that even as technology plays a role in
shaping society, technology and its social impacts are
also simultaneously shaped by society .
Similarly, it is necessary to recognize the various factors
that influence the impacts of tech ethics in practice.
Currently, ethics in digital technology is often treated
through a view of “ethical determinism”, with an
underlying assumption that adopting “ethics” will lead
to ethical technologies. Yet evidence from science,
business, and digital technology demonstrates that
embracing “ethics” is typically not sufficient to prompt
substantive changes. As with technology, ethics does not
on its own determine sociotechnical outcomes. We
therefore need to consider the indeterminacy of tech
ethics: i.e., how the impacts of tech ethics are shaped by
social, political, and economic forces.
5.3 Solutionism
Closely intertwined with a belief in technological
determinism is the practice of technological solutionism:
the expectation that technology can solve all social
problems . A great deal of sociotechnical scholarship
has demonstrated how digital technology “solutions” to
social problems not only typically fail to provide the
intended solutions, but also can exacerbate the problems
they are intended to solve[160−163]. Similarly, it is
necessary to recognize the limits of what tech ethics can
accomplish. Currently, even as tech ethics debates have
highlighted how technology is not always the answer to
social problems, a common response has been to
embrace an “ethical solutionism”: promoting ethics
principles and practices as the solution to these
sociotechnical problems. A notable example (at the heart
of many tech ethics agendas) is the response to
algorithmic discrimination through algorithmic fairness,
which often centers narrow mathematical definitions of
fairness but leaves in place the structural and systemic
conditions that generate a great deal of algorithmic
harms . Efforts to introduce ethics in digital
technology function similarly, providing an addendum
of ethical language and practices on top of existing
structures and epistemologies which themselves are
uninterrogated.
specifications of algorithmic fairness are insufficient to
guarantee fair algorithms, tech ethics principles are
insufficient to guarantee ethical technologies. Ethics
principles, toolkits, and training must be integrated into
broader approaches for improving digital technology
that include activism, policy reforms, and new
engineering practices.
5.4 Sociotechnical systems
A key benefit of analyzing technologies through a
sociotechnical lens is expanding the frame of analysis
beyond the technical artifact itself. Rather than operating
isolation,
sociotechnical systems, such that the artifact and society
“co-produce” social outcomes . Similarly, it is
necessary to view tech ethics as embedded within social,
economic, and legal environments, which shape the uses
and impacts of tech ethics. Currently, efforts to promote
ethical technology typically focus on the internal
Ben Green:   The Contestation of Tech Ethics: A Sociotechnical Approach to Technology Ethics in Practice
characteristics of tech ethics—which principles to
promote, for instance—with little attention to the
impacts of these efforts when integrated into a tech
company or computer science curriculum. In turn, tech
ethics has had limited effects on technology production
and has played a legitimizing role for technology
companies. Attempts to promote more equitable
technology must instead consider the full context in
which tech ethics is embedded. The impacts of tech
ethics are shaped by the beliefs and actions of engineers,
the economic incentives of companies, cultural and
political pressures, and regulatory environments.
Evaluating tech ethics in light of these factors can
generate better predictions about how particular efforts
will fare in practice. Furthermore, focusing on these
contextual factors can illuminate reforms that are more
likely to avoid the pitfalls associated with tech ethics.
6 Conclusion
A sociotechnical lens on tech ethics will not provide
clear answers for how to improve digital technologies.
The technological, social, legal, economic, and political
challenges are far too entangled and entrenched for
simple solutions or prescriptions. Nonetheless, a
sociotechnical approach can help us reason about the
benefits and limits of tech ethics in practice. Doing so
will inform efforts to develop rigorous strategies for
reforming digital technologies.
That is the task of this special issue: “Technology
Ethics in Action: Critical and Interdisciplinary
Perspectives”. The articles in this issue provide a range
of perspectives regarding the value of tech ethics and the
interrogating
relationships between ethics, technology, and society,
we hope to prompt reflection, debate, and action in the
service of a more just society.
