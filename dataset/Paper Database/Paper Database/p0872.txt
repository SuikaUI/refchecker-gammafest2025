The introduction of permutation tests by R.A.Fisher relaxed the parametric structure requirement of a test statistic. For example, the structure
of the test statistic is no longer required if the assumption of normality
is removed. The between-object distance function of classical test statistics based on the assumption of normality is squared Euclidean distance.
Because squared Euclidean distance is not a metric (i.e., the triangle inequality is not satisfied), it is not at all surprising that classical tests are
severely affected by an extreme measurement of a single object. A major
purpose of this book is to take advantage of the relaxation of the structure of a statistic allowed by permutation tests. While a variety of distance
functions are valid for permutation tests, a natural choice possessing many
desirable properties is ordinary (i.e., non-squared) Euclidean distance. Simulation studies show that permutation tests based on ordinary Euclidean
distance are exceedingly robust in detecting location shifts of heavy-tailed
distributions. These tests depend on a metric distance function and are
reasonably powerful for a broad spectrum of univariate and multivariate
distributions.
Least sum of absolute deviations (LAD) regression linked with a permutation test based on ordinary Euclidean distance yields a linear model
analysis which controls for type I error. These Euclidean distance-based
regression methods offer robust alternatives to the classical method of linear model analyses involving the assumption of normality and ordinary
sum of least square deviations (OLS) regression linked with tests based on
squared Euclidean distance. In addition, consideration is given to a number of permutation tests for (1) discrete and continuous goodness-of-fit,
(2) independence in multidimensional contingency tables, and (3) discrete
and continuous multisample homogeneity. Examples indicate some favorable characteristics of seldom used tests.
Following a brief introduction in Chapter 1, Chapters 2, 3, and 4 provide
the motivation and description of univariate and multivariate permutation
tests based on distance functions for completely randomized and randomized block designs. Applications are provided. Chapter 5 describes the linear
model methods based on the linkage between regression and permutation
tests, along with recently developed linear and nonlinear model prediction
techniques. Chapters 6, 7, and 8 include the goodness-of-fit, contingency table, and multisample homogeneity tests, respectively. Appendix A contains
an annotated listing of the computer programs used in the book, organized
by chapter.
Paul Mielke is indebted to the following former University of Minnesota
faculty members: his advisor Richard B. McHugh for introducing him to
permutation tests, Jacob E. Bearman and Eugene A. Johnson for motivating the examination of various problems from differing points of view,
and also to Constance van Eeden and 1. Richard Savage for motivating his
interest in nonparametric methods. He wishes to thank two of his Colorado
State University students, Benjamin S. Duran and Earl S. Johnson, for
stimulating his long term interest in alternative permutation methods. Finally, he wishes to thank his Colorado State University colleagues Franklin
A. Graybill, Lewis O. Grant, William M. Gray, Hariharan K. lyer, David
C. Bowden, Peter J. Brockwell, Yi-Ching Yao, Mohammed M. Siddiqui,
Jagdish N. Srivastava, and James S. Williams, who have provided him
with motivation and various suggestions pertaining to this topic over the
years. Kenneth Berry is indebted to the former University of Oregon faculty
members Walter T. Martin, mentor and advisor, and William S. Robinson
who first introduced him to nonparametric statistical methods. Colorado
State University colleagues Jeffrey 1. Eighmy, R. Brooke Jacobsen, Michael
G. Lacy, and Thomas W. Martin were always there to listen, advise, and
encourage.
