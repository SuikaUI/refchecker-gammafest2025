DETECTION PROBLEMS
The detection problems to be studied in this paper may
be described as follows. We are given N samples from a
real, scalar time series {y(n), n = 0,1,
00" N - I} which
are assembled into the N-dimensional measurement vector
[y(O),y(I),oo.,y(N _1)]T. Based on these data, we
must decide between two possible hypotheses regarding how
the data was generated. The null hypothesis Ho says that the
data consist of noise tI only. The alternative hypothesis H 1
says that the data consist of a sum of signal J-LX and noise tI;
tI : N[ScjJ, a 2Ro],
S E IRN x t ,
cjJ E IRt ,
Ro > 0 E IRN x N .
to include subspace interferences. These problems involve
unknown parameters in the mean and covariance of a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution. For each problem in the
class, we establish invariances for the GLR and find that they
are identical to the natural invariances for the problem. We
show that a monotone function of the GLRT equals one of
the uniformly most powerful invariant (UMP-invariant) tests
derived in . This means that the GLRT is itself UMPinvariant. In addition to tying up the theories of invariance and
the GLRT, our results generalize and extend previous work on
these problems published in - .
We begin our development by establishing the invariances
of the GLRT in the MVN problem. We then specialize our
results for structured means in order to derive UMP-invariant
GLRT detectors for matched subspace filtering in subspace
interference. The GLRT produces an UMP-invariant detector,
which is CFAR if the noise variance is unknown. As we shall
find, the optimum detector may be interpreted as a null steering
or interference rejecting processor followed by a matched
subspace detector.

INTRODUCTION
HE matched filter, or more accurately the matched signal
detector, is one of the basic building blocks of signal
processing; however, in many applications the rank-I matched
signal detector is replaced by a multirank matched subspace
detector. In fact, the matched subspace detector is really the
general building block, and the matched signal detector is a
special case. In sonar signal processing, the matched subspace
detector is called a matched field detector.
In [I], one of the authors developed a theory of matched
subspace detectors based on the construction of invariant
statistics. In this paper we extend this work in two ways. First,
we include structured interference in the measurement model,
and second we use the principle of the generalized likelihood
ratio test (GLRT) to derive matched subspace detectors. By
studying the invariance classes for these GLRT's, we are
able to establish that the GLRT's are invariant to a natural
set of invariances and optimum within the class of detectors
which share these invariances. This establishes once and for
all the optimality of the GLRT for solving matched subspace
detection problems and answers "no" to the question, "can
the GLRT be improved upon?" This result holds for all finite
sample sizes, thereby improving on the standard asymptotic
theory of the GLRT.
Our program in this paper is to derive GLRT's for the
class of problems studied in , - and generalize them
Abstract-In this paper we formulate a general class of problems for detecting subspace signals in subspace interference and
broadband noise. We derive the generalized likelihood ratio
(GLR) for each problem in the class. We then establish the
invariances for the GLR and argue that these are the natural
invariances for the problem. In each case, the GLR is a maximal
invariant statistic, and the distribution of the maximal invariant
statistic is monotone. This means that the GLR test (GLRT) is
the uniformly most powerful invariant detector. We illustrate the
utility of this finding by solving a number of problems for detecting subspace signals in subspace interference and broadband
noise. In each case we give the distribution for the detector and
compute performance curves.

III. LINEAR ALGEBRAIC PRELIMINARIES
When we say that the signal x obeys the linear subspace
model x = HO, we are saying that the vector x E IRN actually
lies in a p-dimensional subspace of IRN which we denote
(H). The subspace (H) is the range of the transformation
H. It is spanned by the columns of the matrix H. These
columns comprise a basis for the subspace, and the elements
of 0 = (fh(h ... (}p)T are the coordinates of x with respect to
this basis. Similarly, the interference 8e/> lies in at-dimensional
subspace of IRN . This subspace, spanned by the columns of
8, is denoted (8).
Together, the columns of the concatenated matrix (H8)
span the(p + t)-dimensional subspace (H8). This subspace
is illustrated in Fig. 2. The typical orthogonal projection of
y E IRN onto (H8) is denoted PH8Y, where PH8 is the
projection
We expect I(y) to be greater than one whenever the parameters
(PI,ai) better model y than do the parameters (Po, 0'5)·
The detection problem outlined here applies to the detection
of lines or modal signals in broadband noise and narrowband
inteferences or to the detection of propagating fields (whether
planar or not) in propagating interferences and broadband
noise. Then the matrix H is a matrix of Vandermonde columns
or of autoregressive impulse responses. The matrix 8 may be
a Vandermonde matrix, one of the matrices illustrated in the
following examples, or almost anything which characterizes
structured noise.
Example i-Detection in UnknownBias: When there is an
unknown bias added to a measurement, then we may say
y = I-£x+v where v: N[b1, 0'21]. The bias is b1 = (bb ... b)T
with b unknown. In this case, the interference subspace (8) is
the rank-I subspace (1).
Example 2-Detection in Sinusoidal interference: When
there is a sinusoidal interference of known frequency but
unknown amplitude and phase,
St = Acos(wot - ¢) =
Acos¢coswot+Asin¢sinwot, then we may say y = I-£x+v
where v : N[8e/>, 0'21]. The interference is
which is a function of (P, 0'2) with the data y playing the role
of a parameter. For any two values (PI' ar) and (Po, 0'5), the
likelihood ratio is defined to be

The component I-£HO is an information-bearing signal that
lies in the subspace (H), and the component
8e/> is an
interference that lies in the subspace (8). The noise n =
8e/> = v -
8e/> : N[O, 0'21] is additive white
Gaussian noise. The subspaces (H) and (8) are not orthogonal
(i.e. H T 8 =I 0), but they are linearly independent, meaning
that there is no element of (H) which can be written as a
linear combination of vectors in (8). Linear independence is
much weaker than orthogonality. We assume that H and 8 are
each full-rank matrices, meaning that (H) and (8) are each
full-rank subspaces.
Fig. I illustrates the detection problem two ways: first, as a
communication problem of detecting a signal when a channel
adds background noise and structured interference and second,
as an algebraic problem of determining which subspaces of
IRN better model the measurement y. In the second illustration,
the problem is to determine whether y is more probably
described by signal plus noise plus interference or by noise
plus interference. The signal subspace (H) and the interference
subspace (8), illustrated in Fig. I, are generally of dimension
greater than 1. When these subspaces are very close, then the
resolution of hypotheses is difficult.
The probability density function for the MVN vector y is
j(y;p,a2 ) = (27ra2)-N/2 exp{ -
where y is the variable of the function and P= (1-£0, e/» is the
parameter of the density. The noise n is
Illustrating the detection problem: (a) Detecting a signal in interference plus additive noise; (b) resolving a measurement into signal plus
interference plus noise.
We shall assume that H, 8, and Ro are known, although
we will offer some ways to relax this assumption in our
conclusions. Without loss of generality, we assume that Ro =
I. Then the detection problem is a test of distributions:
Ho : y : N[8e/>, 0'21] vs HI : y : N[I-£HO + 8e/>, 0'21].
n = y - I-£HO - 8e/>.

In the first of these decompositions, the orthogonal projection PHS is resolved into oblique projections EHS and

the subspace spanned by columns of the matrix P~H; the

the subspace (P~H) is the part of (H) which is unaccounted

IV. THE GLRT AND ITS NATURAL INVARIANCES
The question we pose is this: "What can we say about the
(generalized) likelihood ratio when unknown parameters are
replaced by maximum likelihood estimates (MLE's) of them?"
In other words, what kinds of invariances does the estimated
likelihood ratio have, and how is it distributed? As we shall
see, these questions underlie a systematic discussion of the
GLRT, its invariances, and its optimality.

shall refer to L 1(y) and L 2(y) as GLRs.

By studying the invariance class T, we gain geometrical insight into the mathematical structure of the GLR. Furthermore,
we will be able to show that, of all detectors that are invariant-
T, the GLRT is the uniformly most powerful (UMP). This is
the strongest statement of optimality that we could hope to
make about a test of Ho versus HI, meaning that the GLRT
cannot be improved upon by any detector which shares its
invariances. We will argue that the invariances are so natural
that no detector would be accepted which did not have them.
With these preliminaries established, we now undertake
a study of four closely related problems, ranging from the
detection of known-form signals in subspace interference and
Gaussian noise to the detection of subspace signals in subspace
interference and Gaussian noise of unknown level.

(Fig. 6 is geometrically convincing, but a rigorous proof
requires an algebraic proof.) This' makes the GLR L 2(y) a
maximal invariant statistic.
Again, the subspace P~x is the subspace where the signal
x lies after it has passed through the null-steering operator
P~. The ratio of energies that define L2(y) are-and ought
to be-invariant to rotations around this subspace and to sealings, because scalings are what introduce unknown variances.
Therefore, the invariances of L 2(y) are, indeed, the natural

PPA = 1 - P[tl,N-t-l(O) ~ 17]
PD = 1 - P[tt,N-t-l('x) ~ 17].
The ROC curves are given in Fig. 7, and the detector diagram
is given in Fig. 8. In Fig. 7, the probability of false alarm
is fixed at PPA = 0.01, and the sample size is varied from
N = 2 to N = 32 in powers of 2. The normal ROC curve is
plotted for reference. Note that the detector of Fig. 8 uses an
interference rejecting filter followed by a matched filter in the
top branch and a noise power estimator in the lower branch.
In fact, y T p~pt;P~y/(N - 1) is a maximum likelihood
estimator of (J2. The results of this section generalize results

SUBSPACE SIGNAL IN SUBSPACE
INTERFERENCE AND NOISE OF KNOWN LEVEL
This problem is a generalization of the problem solved in
Section V. The signal /-LX is replaced by the signalltBO, where
(B) is a rank-p subspace. Now, as the elements of 0 may be
positive or negative, we do not constrain ItBO to lie in any
particular orthant of (B). Therefore, It is absorbed into 0 and
(We have used the identity of (3.7).) The identical quadratic
forms yP~PGP~y and yTPGY are generalized energy detectors. Recall that G = P~B.
Invariances: The GLR Ll(y) is invariant to transformations T E T3 that rotate y within (G) (or around (G)1-) and
add a (bias) component in (G)1-. Furthermore, if Ll(Yl) =
Ll(Y2)' then there exists a transformation T E T3 such that
Y2 = T(Yl)' This makes the logarithmic GLR a maximal
invariant statistic, meaning that every T3-invariant test of Ho
versus HI must be a function of it.
The space (G) is the space where x = HO lies after it
has passed through the null-steering operator P~. As 0 is
unknown and unconstrained, the signal to be detected can lie
anywhere in (G). No signal of constant energy in (G) should
be any more detectable than any other, so Ll(y) should be
invariant to rotations in (G). The detector is-and should
be-invariant to measurement components orthogonal to (G).
These natural invariances for this problem are illustrated in

The ROC curves for the GLRT are given in Fig. 10, and the
detector diagram is given in Fig. 11. In Fig. 10, the probability
of false alarm is fixed at PPA = 0.01, and the dimension of the
subspace (H) is varied from p = 2 to P= 8 in steps of 2. The
normal ROC is plotted for reference. Note that the detector
of Fig. 11 decomposes into a subspace filter for interference
rejection, a subspace filter matched to the remaining signal,
and an energy computation. These results generalize the results
of , , - .
It is natural to reference L2(y) to unity, in which case the
m~motone function L 2(y) - 1 is
L 2(y) is therefore

PD = 1 - P[X;(A 2 ) s 77].
SUBSPACE SIGNAL IN SUBSPACE
INTERFERENCE AND NOISE OF UNKNOWN LEVEL
This problem is a generalization of the problems solved in
Sections VI and VII. The signal f.LX is replaced by the signal
f.LHfJ, and the noise level a 2 is unknown. The parameter f.L is
absorbed into fJ, and the problem is to test the hypotheses
Ho : Y : N[ScP, a 21] versus HI : Y : N[HfJ+ ScP, a 21];
IlfJll~ > 0, a 2 unknown.
For this problem, the MLE's are those of (7.2). The GLR
(We have used the identities of (3.6) and (3.7).) In what follows
we shall call L 2(y) - 1 simply L 2(y).
Invariances: The GLR L 2(y) is invariant to transformations T
that rotate in (G) (or around (G)J..) and
non-negatively scale y, as illustrated in Fig. 12. They leave
the angle v invariant. Furthermore, if L2(YI ) = L2(Y2)' then
Y2 = T(YI) for some T E 4. This makes L 2(y) a maximal
invariant statistic.
Again, (G) is the subspace where x lies after it has passed
through the null-steering operator P~. The detector should be
invariant to rotations in this space for the reasons given in

The parameter s is the dimension of (S).1, namely s = N -t >

PD = 1 - P[Fp,s_p(A2 ) ::; 'TI].
The ROC curves for the GLRT are given in Figs. 13 and
14, and the detector diagram is given in Fig. 15. In Fig. 13,
the probability of false alarm is fixed at PFA = 0.01, the
dimension of the subspace (H) is p = 2, and N is varied
64 in powers of 2. The ROC for
the X2 distributed matched subspace detector is plotted for
reference. In Fig. 14, the probability of false alarm is fixed
0.01, the number of measurements is fixed at
N = 16, and the subspace dimension is varied from p = 2
8 in steps of 2. The normal ROC is plotted for
reference. The detector of Fig. 15 decomposes into a subspace
filter for interference rejection, a subspace filter matched to
the remaining signal, and an energy computation, divided by
the same operations with the matched subspace filter replaced
by an orthogonal (or "noise") subspace filter. These results
generalize the results of , - .
In summary, the GLRT is UMP invariant for detecting subspace signals in subspace interferences and background noise
whenever the noise is MVN. The conclusion holds whether
or not the noise variance is known. When the interference
is absent, then P~H

the problem.
Optimality and Performance: The (N/2)-root GLR is the
unique invariant statistic for testing Ha versus HI. It is
the ratio of quadratic forms in P~PGP~ and P~P'bP~.
Each of the quadratic forms may be thought of as a normsquared of a statistic P GP~y or P'bP~y. These statistics
are, respectively, distributed as

The generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is a standard
procedure for solving detection problems when (nuisance)

parameters of the underlying distribution are unknown. Typically, nuisance parameters are things like bias, amplitude and
phase of sinusoidal interference, noise variance, and so on.
These parameters are of no intrinsic interest, but they defeat
our efforts to state properties of optimality if we proceed along
conventional lines.
The GLRT is easy to derive, and sometimes its distribution
can be determined. In these cases, a detection threshold may be
set to achieve a constant false alarm rate (CFAR). In spite of its
tractability as a bootstrapping technique for solving detection
problems, the GLRT has been difficult to characterize in terms
of its optimality properties for the class of problems studied
in this paper. In fact, it has not been clear whether or not the
GLRT has any optimality properties at all for this class. So the
question has remained, "can the GLRT be improved upon?"
In this paper we have constructed GLRT's for four detection
problems which span a large subset of the practical detection
problems encountered in time series analysis and multisensor
array processing. For each class of problems we have derived
the GLRT and established its invariances. Then we have drawn
on the theory of invariance in hypothesis testing to establish
that, within the class of invariant detectors which have the
same invariances as the GLRT, the GLRT is uniformly most
powerful (UMP) invariant. This is the strongest statement of
optimality one could hope to make for a detector. For each
class of problems, the invariances of the GLRT are just the
invariances one would expect of a detector that claims to be
optimum. The conclusion is that the GLRT cannot be improved
upon for the classes of problems studied in this paper.
The geometrical interpretation of our results is this: Think
of the plane < S >.1. in Fig. 2 (i) as a backplane onto which
