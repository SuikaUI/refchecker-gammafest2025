Background and Purpose: Reproducible segmentation of brain tumors on magnetic resonance images is an important
clinical need. This study was designed to evaluate the reliability of a novel fully automated segmentation tool for brain
tumor image analysis in comparison to manually defined tumor segmentations.
Methods: We prospectively evaluated preoperative MR Images from 25 glioblastoma patients. Two independent expert
raters performed manual segmentations. Automatic segmentations were performed using the Brain Tumor Image Analysis
software (BraTumIA). In order to study the different tumor compartments, the complete tumor volume TV (enhancing part
plus non-enhancing part plus necrotic core of the tumor), the TV+ (TV plus edema) and the contrast enhancing tumor
volume CETV were identified. We quantified the overlap between manual and automated segmentation by calculation of
diameter measurements as well as the Dice coefficients, the positive predictive values, sensitivity, relative volume error and
absolute volume error.
Results: Comparison of automated versus manual extraction of 2-dimensional diameter measurements showed no
significant difference (p = 0.29). Comparison of automated versus manual segmentation of volumetric segmentations
showed significant differences for TV+ and TV (p,0.05) but no significant differences for CETV (p.0.05) with regard to the
Dice overlap coefficients. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients (r) of TV+, TV and CETV showed highly significant
correlations between automatic and manual segmentations. Tumor localization did not influence the accuracy of
segmentation.
Conclusions: In summary, we demonstrated that BraTumIA supports radiologists and clinicians by providing accurate
measures of cross-sectional diameter-based tumor extensions. The automated volume measurements were comparable to
manual tumor delineation for CETV tumor volumes, and outperformed inter-rater variability for overlap and sensitivity.

Introduction
Glial tumors are the most frequent primary brain tumors in
adults, accounting for 70% of adult primary cerebral malignancies. Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant primary
brain tumor in humans, exhibits very rapid infiltrative growth and
a poor prognosis, with an average survival time after GBM
diagnosis of one year . In recent years, the overall survival of
glioblastoma patients has increased due to more extensive
treatment strategies such as concomitant radio- and chemotherapy
 and advanced surgical techniques like fluorescence-guided
surgery with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-Ala) or advanced mapping
methods .
Prognostic biomarkers for improved survival include imaging of
the extent of resection based on the amount of postoperatively
enhancing tissue as determined by structural MRI. Depending on
the study populations, gross resection of 78% to 98% of the
enhancing tumor volume is associated with an improved survival
in patients with previously untreated or recurrent GBM .
Preoperative imaging characteristics associated with better survival
are: i) absence of necrosis, ii) amount of contrast enhancing tumor,
and iii) extent of solid tumor exceeding the enhancement .
Whole tumor and sub-compartment segmentation is performed
manually in most centers and is still considered the ‘‘gold
standard’’ procedure. Several studies reported failures of individual expert rater segmentations because structural MRI may

obscure the precise visual delineation of glioma boundaries . In addition, manual segmentation is time-consuming and is a
rate-determining step for further treatment planning . Fully
automated user-independent segmentation tools are available for
research purposes. However, up to now they were considered
limited with regard to ease of use, accuracy and speed, and
therefore not adequate for clinical applications .
There is a large body of literature available on automatic brain
tumor segmentation , but only recently the focus is shifting
towards segmentation of individual tumor sub-compartments from
multi-modal images. Most of the relevant fully automatic brain
tumor segmentation methods employ a supervised or unsupervised
tissue classification, that assigns labels based on voxel-wise or
regionally extracted features. Corso et al. segmented tumor
core and edema using Bayesian tissue classification fused with
affinity assignment by weighted aggregation. Verma et al. 
used a support vector machine classifier to segment necrotic, active
and edema tumor tissues. Bauer et al. followed a similar
regularization
constraints
robustness. Menze et al. combined an atlas of normal
individuals with a latent tumor atlas to employ a generative model
for segmenting tumor compartments in different modalities. Zikic
et al. used context-aware voxel features as input for a decision
forest classifier to segment 3 different tumor compartments from
multi-modal images. A comparison of the performance of many
recent methods on a standardized research dataset can be found in
Almost all evaluations so far focus on the assessment of overlap
measures like Dice coefficient, which are well established for
comparing segmentation algorithms. However, other clinically
more relevant measures like the diameter-based RANO metrics
 , volume error or the tendency to over- or undersegment are
hardly ever reported. Moreover, there are only very few methods,
for which the source code is publicly available (e.g. ), and to
the best of our knowledge there exists not a single publicly
available fully automatic segmentation tool with a graphical user
interface that can be used by non-specialists and that can be
applied to clinical images directly.
This study was designed to compare a novel clinically-oriented
fully automated segmentation tool for brain tumor image analysis
with manually defined tumor segmentations by two independent
raters. Specifically, we aimed to evaluate: i) whether the fully
automated tool can reproduce current 2D diameter-based criteria
for brain tumor assessment ; ii) whether volumetric criteria
can be reliably estimated by fully automated segmentation,
including susceptibility to failure within dedicated sub-compartments. Furthermore, we also report iii) whether tumor localization
has an effect on the quality of automated segmentations; iv) how
improved image acquisition protocols impact the segmentation
Study population
Patients with newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed
glioblastoma pre-operatively admitted to our institution between
October 2012 and July 2013 were eligible for this prospective
study. Exclusion criteria were: incomplete image acquisition,
Karnofsky performance status ,70%, abnormal hematologic,
renal or hepatic function, and previous cranial neurosurgery. The
study was approved by the Local Research Ethics Commission
(Kantonale Ethikkommission Bern). All patients provided written
informed consent.
MR Imaging Protocol
MR images were acquired on two different 1.5 TMR scanners
(Siemens Avanto and Siemens Aera, Siemens, Erlangen/Germany). Every patient underwent a standardized MRI protocol
including: i) 3D-T1w-MPR in sagittal acquisition, 1 mm isotropic
resolution; ii) post-contrast 3D-T1w-MPR in sagittal acquisition,
1 mm isotropic resolution; iii) 3-D T2w (SPC) in sagittal
acquisition, 1 mm isotropic resolution; iv) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) (TIR 2D) in axial acquisition. The
sequence parameters were as follows: for pre-contrast 3D-T1w-
TE = 2.67 ms,
TR = 1580 ms,
FOV = 2566256 mm2, FA = 8u, with an isotropic voxel resolution
of 1 mm61 mm61 mm; for post-contrast T1w TE = 4.57 ms,
TR = 2070 ms, FOV = 2566256 mm2, FA = 15u, using isotropic
1 mm61 mm61 mm voxels; for 3D T2w (SPC) in sagittal
acquisition TE = 380 ms, TR = 3000 ms, FOV = 2566256 mm2,
FA = 120u, using isotropic 1 mm61 mm61 mm voxels; for the
2D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence TE = 80 ms,
TR = 8000 ms, FOV = 2566256 mm2, FA = 120u, using a nonisotropic voxel size 1 mm61 mm63 mm.
Re-evaluation of pooled datasets from the MICCAI BraTS
In order to compare the impact of the modified imaging
protocols on the segmentation quality, we additionally analyzed a
dataset composed of MR images from the MICCAI 2012 Brain
Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge consisting of in-silico and
research datasets of brain tumor patients . This dataset is
different from the dataset in our clinical study described above.
The BraTS images included the same MRI sequences with lower
resolutions and various parameter settings. Quality of the
automated segmentation was tested compared to the manually
generated ground truth using the online evaluation tool (http://
www2.imm.dtu.dk/projects/BRATS2012).
Two-dimensional measurements
In order to compare the accuracy of automated versus manual
segmentation, we computed the product of two maximum
diameters for 2-dimensional measurements, as recommended for
reporting of gross tumor volume by the WHO and the refined
RANO guidelines . The automated 2-dimensional measurements were extracted from the largest perpendicular diameters
of the contrast-enhancing lesions of the automatically segmented
tumor expansion. These were compared to the measurements of
our two expert raters using the product of maximal cross-sectional
enhancing diameters. In case of multiple lesions, the sum of
products of diameters (SPD) of all lesions was calculated .
Manual volumetric segmentation
The manual segmentations were performed by two independent
expert raters: an expert in brain tumor imaging (SB) and a
neurosurgeon experienced in brain tumor analysis (NP). Both
raters were supervised independently by two neuroradiologists
with more than 10 years of experience in brain tumor imaging
(RW and RKV). Manual segmentation was performed with the
open source software 3D Slicer Version 4.2.2.3 (www.slicer.org)
 . Every patient (n = 25) was segmented manually slice by slice.
Segmentation was performed on T1w, T1wGd, T2w and FLAIR
sequences according to the Vasari MR feature guide v.1.1
( Four different
tumor compartments were classified: i) non-enhancing tumor, ii)
enhancing tumor, iii) necrosis and iv) edema. Hence, nonenhancing tumor was defined on FLAIR, T2w and T1w.
Multi-Modal Glioblastoma Segmentation
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org
May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e96873
Enhancing tumor parts were classified on post-contrast T1
weighted images compared to pre-contrast T1-weighted images
excluding hemorrhage. Necrosis was defined as a region within the
tumor that did not enhance and had a hyper-intense signal on
T2w and FLAIR. Edema was classified on FLAIR, T1w, T2w and
contrast-enhanced T1w . The average time for manually
segmenting all subcomponents of one study patient was approximately one hour.
Automated Segmentation
Automatic segmentations were performed using the Brain
Tumor Image Analysis (BraTumIA) software (available under this
link 
analysis/software/index_eng.html). The software offers a completely integrated segmentation pipeline, where the user only has
to load the original Dicom stacks of the four relevant MRI
modalities (T1w, contrast-enhanced T1w, T2w, FLAIR). Then,
the images are processed in a fully automatic way, including skull
stripping and subsequent rigid co-registration to ensure
voxel-to-voxel correspondence between the different MRI sequences. Based on the registered images, segmentation into
unaffected tissue and tumor tissue, encompassing four different
sub-compartments, is performed based on combined supervised
classification and regularization. The algorithmic core of the
segmentation evolved out of and the basics of the current
approach have been recently described in a conference paper .
Briefly, the segmentation problem is formulated as an energy
minimization task in a conditional random-field context. From
each voxel, a high-dimensional feature vector is extracted,
consisting of multi-modal intensities, texture and gradient statistics
from local image patches, multi-scale symmetry features across the
mid-sagittal plane and location features. Based on this highdimensional feature vector, each voxel is assigned a tissue label by
a decision forest classifier . Spatial constraints and prior
knowledge are considered by a conditional random field regularization to increase robustness. More details are given in Data S1
and in .

The segmentation method requires training on manually
performed on 36 separate patients that were not part of the
study. Computation time for the complete automatic processing
was less than 5 minutes. The algorithmic core of the software was
among the best performing methods at the MICCAI Brain Tumor
Segmentation
( 
projects/BRATS2012/). A screenshot of the user interface of the
integrated software is shown in figure 1.
Statistical methods
We evaluated the results primarily using the Dice coefficient
 . The Dice coefficient measures the overlap of two regions (i.e.
region 1 given by a manual segmentation, region 2 given by the
automatic segmentation). It can range from 0 to 1, with 0

Additionally, we also report the positive predictive value (PPV)
 , sensitivity and volume error between manual and
automatic segmentations. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was
used for the statistical analysis of the difference between manual
and automated volumetric segmentation in terms of the metrics
mentioned above. For inter-observer comparisons and automatic
versus manual comparisons, we also used Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficients . For the comparison of 2-dimensional
measures and investigation of the impact of localization, nonparametric analysis of variance was performed. Statistical
analysis was done using Graphpad Prism version 5.
Study population
The mean patient age at pre-operative MR imaging (+/2
standard deviation (SD)) was 67.75 years +/26.191 (range 53–79
years), mean pre-operative Karnofsky performance status (+/2
SD) was 84.38% +/26.292 (range 70–90%), and mean preoperative NIHSS (+/2SD) was 0.25+/21.12 (range 0–3). Of the
25 patients, 10 were female and 15 male. Five patients underwent
stereotactic biopsy, 11 subtotal extirpations and nine complete
resections of enhancing tumor (CRET). All diagnoses were
confirmed by histopathology.
Comparison of automated versus manual segmentation
Two-Dimensional measurements.
Comparison between
automated and manual 2-dimensional measurements by two
expert raters was done using the product of maximal crosssectional enhancing diameters (SPD in mm2+/2SD). The mean
absolute difference in SPD of automatic diameter versus expert
rater 1 was 570 mm2 (+/2569), (95% CI ); the mean
absolute difference in SPD of automatic diameter versus expert
rater 2 was 495 mm2 (+/2438), (95% CI ). The mean
absolute difference in SPD of expert rater 1 versus expert rater
(+/2SD) was 355 mm2 (+/2380), (95% CI ). There
was no significant difference between the three different measurements (Friedman test; p = 0.29). The results are depicted in
Volumetric Segmentation.
To evaluate the different tumor
compartments, we separately investigated the complete tumor
volume (TV) encompassing the enhancing part of the tumor, the
non-enhancing part of the tumor plus the necrotic core, the TV+
(TV plus edema) and the contrast enhancing tumor volume
(CETV) of the GBM. We quantified the overlap between manual
and automated segmentation by calculation of the Dice coefficients, the positive predictive values (PPV), sensitivity, relative
volume error and absolute volume error. The results are
summarized graphically with boxplots in figure 3. Average Dice

the automatic segmentation was 20.4 ml for TV+, 14.5 ml for TV

ground truth). The relationship between automatically and
manually calculated volumes of individual tumor sub-compartments is shown with scatterplots in figure 4. Details can be found

Of the 25 analyzed data sets, 8 tumors were
in the frontal lobes, 8 temporal, 8 parietal and one occipital (the
latter was excluded from group analyses). In order to identify a
potential impact of the tumor localization in different lobes of the
brain on the accuracy of automated segmentation, we analyzed
the influence of the tumor localization (frontal, temporal, parietal)
on the Dice overlaps. A Kruskal-Wallis test revealed no differences
related to the localization or the sub-compartments (see Table 3).

Comparison of the Dice coefficients for automatic
segmentation between the non-standardized MICCAI BraTS
2012 test data and the standardized high resolution datasets in our
study patients revealed improved Dice coefficients for the
standardized protocol in all sub-compartments (see Table 1).
However the improvement was not statistically significant in all
compartments (p = 0.06) due to the small number of patients in the
BraTS dataset (11 patients).
Discussion
In this prospective study we validated an automatic multimodal
segmentation software (BraTumIA) in clinical practice. We
delineated different tumor compartments, i.e. TV, TV+ and
CETV in de novo GBM. Our goal was to evaluate how
BraTumIA performed in our clinical setting in comparison to
manual ratings. We focused on two metrics for clinical evaluation:
the SPD according to the WHO classification , and the
volumes and overlaps of TV, TV+ and CETV. It was shown that
automatic volumetry offers significant time gains compared to
manual volumetry.
Two points stand out among the study results: i) computation of
cross sectional
2-dimensional
extensions is comparable to manual tumor delineation; ii)
estimation of TV, TV+ and CETV by the automatic method
reaches a sensitivity, which is comparable to the inter-observer

variability between two experts performing manual segmentation.
For CETV, BraTumIA had a better overlap with the ground-truth
than Dice overlap between manual inter-rater segmentations.
Furthermore, we observed that classification of automated
segmentation is insensitive to tumor localization and individual
compositions of the sub-segments of GBM. Comparison of the
quality of the automatic segmentations on our new prospective
patient dataset of standardized images with the quality obtained
on the non-standardized BraTS 2012 images, showed an average
improvement of more than 10% (table 1). This indicates that a
standardized high-resolution isotropic imaging protocol such as
the one used in this study has the potential to optimize the quality
of automatic segmentations.
A previous study demonstrated that an extent of resection
(EOR) of the TV $ 78% impacts patient outcome, and that the
positive relationship between EOR and patient outcome can be
observed even at the highest levels of resection . For the preoperative baseline assessment, we observed good concordance of
linear SPD assessment between manual raters and the automated
approach, and a higher sensitivity for automated volumetry of the
CETV compared to two manual raters (72% vs. 53%, figure 3).
Although the linear SPD measures provided a good concordance
between automatic and manual measurements, these measures are
problematic in cases of non-solid GBMs . GBMs usually
appear with a complex morphology, thus necessitating volumetric
analyses. However, diameter-based SPD measures only consider
one tumor compartment (necrosis+enhancing tumor), usually in
low resolution datasets.
Most segmentation techniques focus on reporting of Dice
similarity coefficients of the gross tumor volume instead of
individual tumor sub-compartments. A semi-automatic approach
using Slicer recently reported an average Dice similarity coefficient
of 0.80 . Semi-automatic segmentations tend to produce better
accuracies compared to fully automatic methods but previous
studies suggest that semi-automatic methods are less objective
 . While previous approaches aimed to assess only one tumor

compartment, we analyzed different metrics for TV+, TV and
CETV individually. BraTumIA extends our understanding of
complex morphology because it includes the edematous and
necrotic parts of the tumor. The analysis is more challenging if
several tumor regions are considered separately, but this differentiation offers a window for improved integration of other
modalities such as diffusion or perfusion parameters . In
addition to pre-operative assessment, knowledge about volume
changes beyond the CETV is important for the management of
tumor recurrence and response to chemo- and anti-angiogenic
therapy, since CETV are prone to errors due to pseudo-response
and pseudo-progression . Objective estimates of CETV after
gross resection of the TV may improve risk assessment of tumor
recurrence if the pre-treatment TV and CETV are precisely
determined. This sub-compartmental approach may also provide
a basis for the integration of further prognostic markers to
differentiate pseudo-response or pseudo-progression and may
therefore be of crucial significance for clinical use.
Accurate segmentation of the TV region is particularly
challenging, even for expert raters, because it is difficult to
distinguish edema from non-enhancing tumor. This can also be
seen from the large spread for the TV region in figure 4. Observer
independent sub-compartmental volumetry may identify new
research areas where structural and dynamic texture parameters
can be defined for the different tumor sub-compartments and may
lead to new theories of tumor spread or therapy response by
integrating histopathological features within the TV+ regions
Limitations of this study include the fact that our analysis is
restricted to pre-surgical tumor volumetry. Future work should
address the accuracy of longitudinal volumetric measures and
evaluate whether complementary ADC and perfusion imaging
may improve the clinical yield of ‘‘tailored’’ multi-parameter
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated that BraTumIA supports
radiologists and clinicians with accurate measures of cross
sectional 2-dimensional tumor extensions that are equivalent to
manual tumor delineation, and provides CETV tumor volumes
that have lower variability than manual ratings.
