The goal of the CORES series of conferences is the development of theories,
algorithms, and applications of pattern recognition and machine learning methods.
These conferences have always served as useful forum where researchers, practitioners, and students working in different areas of pattern recognition can meet to
come together and help each other keeping up with this active ﬁeld of research. This
book is a collection of 52 carefully selected works which have been reviewed by the
experts from the domain and accepted for presentation during the 10th International
Conference on Computer Recognition Systems CORES 2017. We hope that the
book can become the valuable source of information on contemporary research
trends and most popular areas of application.
Editors would like to express their deep thanks to authors for their valuable
submissions and all reviewers for their hard work, and we believe that this book
could be a reference tool for scientists who deal with the problems of designing
computer pattern recognition systems.
This year we are celebrating the 85th Anniversary of Prof. Juliusz L. Kulikowski
from Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, Polish
Academy of Sciences, who will be also plenary speaker during the conference. We
will have also possibility to attend two outstanding keynote speeches by Prof.
Katarzyna Stąpor from Silesian University of Technology, Poland, and Dr. Bartosz
Krawczyk from Virginia Commonwealth University, USA.
Although the last, not least, we would like to give special thanks to local
organizing team (Kondrad Jackowski, Dariusz Jankowski, Maciej Krysmann,
Paweł Trajdos, Andrzej Żołnierek) who did a great job.
We would like also to fully acknowledge support from the Wrocław University
of Technology, especially Prof. Andrzej Kasprzak—Chair of Department of
Systems and Computer Networks and Prof. Czesław Smutnicki—Dean of Faculty
of Electronics which have also supported this event.
We believe that this book could be a great reference tool for scientists who deal
with the problems of designing computer pattern recognition systems.

Memories of Professor Co-workers
Juliusz L. Kulikowski received MSc. degree in electronic engineering from the
Warsaw Technical University in 1955, CandSc. degree from the Moscow Higher
School of Technology in 1959, and DSc. degree from the Warsaw Technical
University in 1966. Since 1966, he was a scientiﬁc worker in several Institutes of the
Polish Academy of Sciences. He was a nominated professor in 1973. Since 1981, he
is employed in the Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering PAS in
Warsaw. He published about 300 papers in information science, signals detection
in noise, image processing methods, artiﬁcial intelligence, application of computers
in medicine as well as 8 books and monographs in these domains. For many years,
he was the Editor in Chief of a scientiﬁc quarterly “Computer Graphics & Vision”, a
member of IFIP TC13 on “Human-Computer Interaction” and of IFAC TC on
“Stochastic Systems”, and a Chairman of the Polish National Committee for
cooperation with the Committee of Data for Science and Technology CODATA. He
is an ordinary member of the Warsaw Scientiﬁc Society.
Professor Juliusz Lech Kulikowski appeared in our life when he started working
at the Institute of Automation in 1966 as an associate professor—specialist in
frequency modulation technology. He was appointed the head of a department at
the institute. Then, we were not yet his employees. He immediately gained a
reputation for modest, hardworking, and demanding person. Our ﬁrst contact with
him was participating in a doctoral seminar, which he led next to managing of his
We were fascinated by his depth knowledge and at the same time a clear presentation of statistical methods in both theoretical and practical terms. In 1973, he
received the title of associate professor, and in 1989 the title of professor. At that
time, a team headed by Professor had his ﬁrst success in the form of Award
Scientiﬁc Secretary of the Polish Academy of Sciences in the ﬁeld of digital image
processing. Then, the ﬁrst Polish system of computer image analysis CPO-1/Odra
1204 was developed.
In 1976, Professor left the Institute and started working as a director of the
Computer Science Committee chaired by Prime Minister Piotr Jaroszewicz. At that
time, under the direction of Professor Kulikowski, “Program for the development of
public IT services for the years 1978–1980” was developed and approved by the
Minister of Science, Technology, and Higher Education Prof. Sylwester Kaliski. The
program included the development of government information systems, manufacturing hardware, and the establishment of a system of government SINTO (System
for Scientiﬁc Technical and Organizational Information), which was supposed to
improve the circulation of scientiﬁc information in the country, integrating functional activities of centers of scientiﬁc and technical information in the ministries, the
unions and the workplaces as well as the activities of archives and libraries.
Then, watching the activity of Professor at such a high state level while he was
combining this activity with work in the Institute of Computer Science Polish
Academy of Science, we did not think he would ever come back to us (to our
Institute). This happened in 1981 when the Institute of Biocybernetics and
Biomedical Engineering Polish Academy of Science was established. Professor
Kulikowski was appointed the head of the Department of Information Processing
Method, where his former and new employees were found. The team employed in
the Department counted over 20 people. In the eighties and early nineties, next
system for image analysis CPO-1-3, minicomputer system CPO/M6810 with television camera, and ﬁnally improved systems of computer vision VIST and
SUPERVIST were created.
In 1984, the Institute moved from its headquarter at Twarda street to newly built
buildings at Ks. Trojden street. There were new topics of work and new achievements: the design of DIAVENT system—a computer system for analysis of
ultrasound images of the heart, based on the original mathematical model of ventricular contractility ; the design of an electronic ﬁeld orientation for the blind
ESOT ; and the design of computer diagnosis of urine bladder cancer. After
started working at the Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering,
Professor intensiﬁed his scientiﬁc activity in theoretical issues, such as the use of
discriminant analysis and nonparametric tests for the detection of signals, extended
relational algebra, the measure of the quality of information, tripartite graphs,
topological logic (relative), and morphological spectra. He worked also on the
concept of hyper-relation as a generalization relationship, which is useful to
describe and recognize complex images, the use of deontic logic, and the concept of
recognizing contents of the images based on the ontology of domain describing
their structure using a system of interconnected relationships.
All the time he has been writing and publishing articles, textbooks, and
monographs and also acted as an editor. He was always very conscientious, thorough, and well prepared.
He collaborated with the editorial ofﬁces, lectured at home and abroad, promoted
20 doctors (including many among us). He was active in the national and international organizations (CODATA, IFIP TC-13 Human-Computer Interaction), in a
number of scientiﬁc councils of institutes, reviewed doctoral dissertations, postdoctoral research projects, articles in scientiﬁc journals . He was always up to date
Memories of Professor Co-workers
with publications in his areas of scientiﬁc interest for what allowed him knowledge
of foreign languages (Russian, German, English, and French). In the seventies, he
was repeatedly invited as a visiting professor for lectures to the Dipartimento di
Informatica Università Degli Studi Di Udine and later to the TU Otto von Guericke
University in Magdeburg. It was, among others, in recognition of his high position
in the scientiﬁc ﬁeld of algebraic methods of recognition.
He was always willing to help with scientiﬁc support, add courage, and serve
good advice. His kindness, serenity, and a great sense of humor cause that every
day we gather with pleasure at his secretariat even for a moment to feel the friendly
atmosphere. He cared diligently for our scientiﬁc development, but he did it subtly
and without any stress for us. We gratefully and respectfully still admire his diligence, modesty, tolerance, honesty, and his serenity, great sense of humor and
common sense, and distance to matters less important. He is always cheerful and
with a visible need of bringing joy to others.
Privately, a lover of literature and music, a talented poet.
