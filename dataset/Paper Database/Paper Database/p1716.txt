Motivation: Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the number of biomedical documents
rapidly grows. With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical
corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted
for biomedical corpora.
Results: We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text
Mining), which is a domain-speciﬁc language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora.
With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art
models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains
performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT signiﬁcantly outperforms them on the
following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score
improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering
(12.24% MRR improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora helps it to
understand complex biomedical texts.
Availability and implementation: We make the pre-trained weights of BioBERT freely available at 
com/naver/biobert-pretrained, and the source code for ﬁne-tuning BioBERT available at

1 Introduction
The volume of biomedical literature continues to rapidly increase.
On average, more than 3000 new articles are published every day in
peer-reviewed journals, excluding pre-prints and technical reports
such as clinical trial reports in various archives. PubMed alone has a
total of 29M articles as of January 2019. Reports containing valuable information about new discoveries and new insights are continuously added to the already overwhelming amount of literature.
Consequently, there is increasingly more demand for accurate biomedical text mining tools for extracting information from the
literature.
Recent progress of biomedical text mining models was made
possible by the advancements of deep learning techniques used in
natural language processing (NLP). For instance, Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) and Conditional Random Field (CRF) have greatly
improved performance in biomedical named entity recognition
(NER) over the last few years . Other deep learning based models have made improvements in biomedical text mining tasks such as relation extraction (RE) and question answering (QA) .

However, directly applying state-of-the-art NLP methodologies
to biomedical text mining has limitations. First, as recent word representation models such as Word2Vec , ELMo
 and BERT are trained and
tested mainly on datasets containing general domain texts (e.g.
Wikipedia), it is difficult to estimate their performance on datasets
containing biomedical texts. Also, the word distributions of general
and biomedical corpora are quite different, which can often be a
problem for biomedical text mining models. As a result, recent models in biomedical text mining rely largely on adapted versions of
word representations .
In this study, we hypothesize that current state-of-the-art word
representation models such as BERT need to be trained on biomedical corpora to be effective in biomedical text mining tasks.
Previously, Word2Vec, which is one of the most widely known context independent word representation models, was trained on biomedical corpora which contain terms and expressions that are
usually not included in a general domain corpus . While ELMo and BERT have proven the effectiveness of contextualized word representations, they cannot obtain high performance on biomedical corpora because they are pre-trained on only
general domain corpora. As BERT achieves very strong results on
various NLP tasks while using almost the same structure across the
tasks, adapting BERT for the biomedical domain could potentially
benefit numerous biomedical NLP researches.
2 Approach
In this article, we introduce BioBERT, which is a pre-trained language
representation model for the biomedical domain. The overall process
of pre-training and fine-tuning BioBERT is illustrated in Figure 1. First,
we initialize BioBERT with weights from BERT, which was pretrained
BooksCorpus). Then, BioBERT is pre-trained on biomedical domain
corpora (PubMed abstracts and PMC full-text articles). To show the effectiveness of our approach in biomedical text mining, BioBERT is
fine-tuned and evaluated on three popular biomedical text mining tasks
(NER, RE and QA). We test various pre-training strategies with different combinations and sizes of general domain corpora and biomedical
corpora, and analyze the effect of each corpus on pre-training. We also
provide in-depth analyses of BERT and BioBERT to show the necessity
of our pre-training strategies.
The contributions of our paper are as follows:
BioBERT is the ﬁrst domain-speciﬁc BERT based model pretrained on biomedical corpora for 23 days on eight NVIDIA
V100 GPUs.
We show that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora largely
improves its performance. BioBERT obtains higher F1 scores in
biomedical NER (0.62) and biomedical RE (2.80), and a higher
MRR score (12.24) in biomedical QA than the current state-ofthe-art models.
Compared with most previous biomedical text mining models
that are mainly focused on a single task such as NER or QA, our
model BioBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance on various
biomedical text mining tasks, while requiring only minimal
architectural modiﬁcations.
We make our pre-processed datasets, the pre-trained weights of
BioBERT and the source code for ﬁne-tuning BioBERT publicly
available.
3 Materials and methods
BioBERT basically has the same structure as BERT. We briefly discuss the recently proposed BERT, and then we describe in detail the
pre-training and fine-tuning process of BioBERT.
3.1 BERT: bidirectional encoder representations from
transformers
Learning word representations from a large amount of unannotated
text is a long-established method. While previous models , GloVe )
focused on learning context independent word representations, recent works have focused on learning context dependent word representations. For instance, ELMo uses a
bidirectional language model, while CoVe 
uses machine translation to embed context information into word
representations.
BERT is a contextualized word representation model that is based on a masked language model and pretrained using bidirectional transformers . Due
to the nature of language modeling where future words cannot be
seen, previous language models were limited to a combination of
two unidirectional language models (i.e. left-to-right and right-toleft). BERT uses a masked language model that predicts randomly
masked words in a sequence, and hence can be used for learning bidirectional representations. Also, it obtains state-of-the-art performance on most NLP tasks, while requiring minimal task-specific
architectural modification. According to the authors of BERT,
incorporating information from bidirectional representations, rather
than unidirectional representations, is crucial for representing words
in natural language. We hypothesize that such bidirectional representations are also critical in biomedical text mining as complex
relationships between biomedical terms often exist in a biomedical
corpus . Due to the space limitations, we
refer readers to Devlin et al. for a more detailed description
3.2 Pre-training BioBERT
As a general purpose language representation model, BERT was pretrained on English Wikipedia and BooksCorpus. However, biomedical domain texts contain a considerable number of domain-specific
Fig. 1. Overview of the pre-training and ﬁne-tuning of BioBERT
J.Lee et al.

proper nouns (e.g. BRCA1, c.248T>C) and terms (e.g. transcriptional, antimicrobial), which are understood mostly by biomedical
researchers. As a result, NLP models designed for general purpose
language understanding often obtains poor performance in biomedical text mining tasks. In this work, we pre-train BioBERT on
PubMed abstracts (PubMed) and PubMed Central full-text articles
(PMC). The text corpora used for pre-training of BioBERT are listed
in Table 1, and the tested combinations of text corpora are listed in
Table 2. For computational efficiency, whenever the Wiki þ Books
corpora were used for pre-training, we initialized BioBERT with the
pre-trained BERT model provided by Devlin et al. . We define
BioBERT as a language representation model whose pre-training
corpora includes biomedical corpora (e.g. BioBERT (þ PubMed)).
For tokenization, BioBERT uses WordPiece tokenization , which mitigates the out-of-vocabulary issue. With
WordPiece tokenization, any new words can be represented by frequent subwords (e.g. Immunoglobulin ¼> I ##mm ##uno ##g ##lo
##bul ##in). We found that using cased vocabulary (not lowercasing) results in slightly better performances in downstream tasks.
Although we could have constructed new WordPiece vocabulary
based on biomedical corpora, we used the original vocabulary of
BERTBASE for the following reasons: (i) compatibility of BioBERT
with BERT, which allows BERT pre-trained on general domain corpora to be re-used, and makes it easier to interchangeably use existing models based on BERT and BioBERT and (ii) any new words
may still be represented and fine-tuned for the biomedical domain
using the original WordPiece vocabulary of BERT.
3.3 Fine-tuning BioBERT
With minimal architectural modification, BioBERT can be applied
to various downstream text mining tasks. We fine-tune BioBERT on
the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks:
NER, RE and QA.
Named entity recognition is one of the most fundamental biomedical text mining tasks, which involves recognizing numerous domain-specific proper nouns in a biomedical corpus. While most
previous works were built upon different combinations of LSTMs
and CRFs , BERT has a simple architecture based on bidirectional transformers. BERT uses a single output layer based on the representations from its last layer to compute only token level BIO2
probabilities. Note that while previous works in biomedical NER
often used word embeddings trained on PubMed or PMC corpora
 , BioBERT directly learns
WordPiece embeddings during pre-training and fine-tuning. For the
evaluation metrics of NER, we used entity level precision, recall and
Relation extraction is a task of classifying relations of named
entities in a biomedical corpus. We utilized the sentence classifier of
the original version of BERT, which uses a [CLS] token for the classification of relations. Sentence classification is performed using a
single output layer based on a [CLS] token representation from
BERT. We anonymized target named entities in a sentence using
pre-defined tags such as @GENE$ or @DISEASE$. For instance, a
sentence with two target entities (gene and disease in this case) is
represented as “Serine at position 986 of @GENE$ may be an independent genetic predictor of angiographic @DISEASE$.” The precision, recall and F1 scores on the RE task are reported.
Question answering is a task of answering questions posed in
natural language given related passages. To fine-tune BioBERT for
QA, we used the same BERT architecture used for SQuAD
 . We used the BioASQ factoid datasets because their format is similar to that of SQuAD. Token level probabilities for the start/end location of answer phrases are computed
using a single output layer. However, we observed that about 30%
of the BioASQ factoid questions were unanswerable in an extractive
QA setting as the exact answers did not appear in the given passages. Like Wiese et al. , we excluded the samples with unanswerable questions from the training sets. Also, we used the same
pre-training process of Wiese et al. , which uses SQuAD, and
it largely improved the performance of both BERT and BioBERT.
We used the following evaluation metrics from BioASQ: strict accuracy, lenient accuracy and mean reciprocal rank.
4.1 Datasets
The statistics of biomedical NER datasets are listed in Table 3. We
used the pre-processed versions of all the NER datasets provided by
Wang et al. except the 2010 i2b2/VA, JNLPBA and Species-
800 datasets. The pre-processed NCBI Disease dataset has fewer
annotations than the original dataset due to the removal of duplicate
articles from its training set. We used the CoNLL format (https://
github.com/spyysalo/standoff2conll) for pre-processing the 2010
i2b2/VA and JNLPBA datasets. The Species-800 dataset was preprocessed and split based on the dataset of Pyysalo ( 
com/spyysalo/s800). We did not use alternate annotations for the
BC2GM dataset, and all NER evaluations are based on entity-level
exact matches. Note that although there are several other recently
introduced high quality biomedical NER datasets , we use datasets that are frequently used by many biomedical
NLP researchers, which makes it much easier to compare our work
with theirs. The RE datasets contain gene–disease relations and protein–chemical relations (Table 4). Pre-processed GAD and EU-ADR
CHEMPROT dataset, we used the same pre-processing procedure
described in Lim and Kang . We used the BioASQ factoid
datasets, which can be converted into the same format as the
SQuAD dataset (Table 5). We used full abstracts (PMIDs) and
related questions and answers provided by the BioASQ organizers.
We have made the pre-processed BioASQ datasets publicly available. For all the datasets, we used the same dataset splits used in previous works for a fair evaluation; however, the splits of LINAAEUS
and Species-800 could not be found from Giorgi and Bader 
and may be different. Like previous work , we reported the performance of 10-fold cross-validation on
datasets that do not have separate test sets (e.g. GAD, EU-ADR).
We compare BERT and BioBERT with the current state-of-theart models and report their scores. Note that the state-of-the-art
models each have a different architecture and training procedure.
For instance, the state-of-the-art model by Yoon et al. trained
on the JNLPBA dataset is based on multiple Bi-LSTM CRF models
with character level CNNs, while the state-of-the-art model by
Giorgi and Bader trained on the LINNAEUS dataset uses a
Bi-LSTM CRF model with character level LSTMs and is additionally trained on silver-standard datasets. On the other hand, BERT and

BioBERT have exactly the same structure, and use only the gold
standard datasets and not any additional datasets.
4.2 Experimental setups
We used the BERTBASE model pre-trained on English Wikipedia and
BooksCorpus for 1M steps. BioBERT v1.0 (þ PubMed þ PMC) is
the version of BioBERT (þ PubMed þ PMC) trained for 470 K
steps. When using both the PubMed and PMC corpora, we found
that 200K and 270K pre-training steps were optimal for PubMed
and PMC, respectively. We also used the ablated versions of
BioBERT v1.0, which were pre-trained on only PubMed for 200K
steps (BioBERT v1.0 (þ PubMed)) and PMC for 270K steps
(BioBERT v1.0 (þ PMC)). After our initial release of BioBERT v1.0,
we pre-trained BioBERT on PubMed for 1M steps, and we refer to
this version as BioBERT v1.1 (þ PubMed). Other hyper-parameters
such as batch size and learning rate scheduling for pre-training
BioBERT are the same as those for pre-training BERT unless stated
otherwise.
We pre-trained BioBERT using Naver Smart Machine Learning
(NSML) , which is utilized for large-scale experiments that need to be run on several GPUs. We used eight NVIDIA
V100 (32GB) GPUs for the pre-training. The maximum sequence
length was fixed to 512 and the mini-batch size was set to 192,
resulting in 98 304 words per iteration. It takes more than 10 days
to pre-train BioBERT v1.0 (þ PubMed þ PMC) nearly 23 days for
BioBERT v1.1 (þ PubMed) in this setting. Despite our best efforts
to use BERTLARGE, we used only BERTBASE due to the computational
complexity of BERTLARGE.
We used a single NVIDIA Titan Xp (12GB) GPU to fine-tune
BioBERT on each task. Note that the fine-tuning process is more
computationally efficient than pre-training BioBERT. For finetuning, a batch size of 10, 16, 32 or 64 was selected, and a learning
rate of 5e5, 3e5 or 1e5 was selected. Fine-tuning BioBERT on
QA and RE tasks took less than an hour as the size of the training
data is much smaller than that of the training data used by Devlin
et al. . On the other hand, it takes more than 20 epochs for
BioBERT to reach its highest performance on the NER datasets.
4.3 Experimental results
The results of NER are shown in Table 6. First, we observe that
BERT, which was pre-trained on only the general domain corpus is
quite effective, but the micro averaged F1 score of BERT was lower
(2.01 lower) than that of the state-of-the-art models. On the other
hand, BioBERT achieves higher scores than BERT on all the datasets. BioBERT outperformed the state-of-the-art models on six out
of nine datasets, and BioBERT v1.1 (þ PubMed) outperformed the
state-of-the-art models by 0.62 in terms of micro averaged F1 score.
The relatively low scores on the LINNAEUS dataset can be attributed to the following: (i) the lack of a silver-standard dataset for
training previous state-of-the-art models and (ii) different training/
test set splits used in previous work , which
were unavailable.
The RE results of each model are shown in Table 7. BERT
achieved better performance than the state-of-the-art model on the
CHEMPROT dataset, which demonstrates its effectiveness in RE.
On average (micro), BioBERT v1.0 (þ PubMed) obtained a higher
F1 score (2.80 higher) than the state-of-the-art models. Also,
BioBERT achieved the highest F1 scores on 2 out of 3 biomedical
The QA results are shown in Table 8. We micro averaged the
best scores of the state-of-the-art models from each batch. BERT
obtained a higher micro averaged MRR score (7.0 higher) than the
state-of-the-art models. All versions of BioBERT significantly outperformed BERT and the state-of-the-art models, and in particular,
BioBERT v1.1 (þ PubMed) obtained a strict accuracy of 38.77, a lenient accuracy of 53.81 and a mean reciprocal rank score of 44.77,
all of which were micro averaged. On all the biomedical QA datasets, BioBERT achieved new state-of-the-art performance in terms
5 Discussion
We used additional corpora of different sizes for pre-training and
investigated their effect on performance. For BioBERT v1.0 (þ
PubMed), we set the number of pre-training steps to 200K and varied the size of the PubMed corpus. Figure 2(a) shows that the performance of BioBERT v1.0 (þ PubMed) on three NER datasets
(NCBI Disease, BC2GM, BC4CHEMD) changes in relation to the
size of the PubMed corpus. Pre-training on 1 billion words is quite
effective, and the performance on each dataset mostly improves until
4.5 billion words. We also saved the pre-trained weights from
BioBERT v1.0 (þ PubMed) at different pre-training steps to measure how the number of pre-training steps affects its performance on
fine-tuning tasks. Figure 2(b) shows the performance changes of
BioBERT v1.0 (þ PubMed) on the same three NER datasets in relation to the number of pre-training steps. The results clearly show
that the performance on each dataset improves as the number of
pre-training steps increases. Finally, Figure 2(c) shows the absolute
performance improvements of BioBERT v1.0 (þ PubMed þ PMC)
over BERT on all 15 datasets. F1 scores were used for NER/RE, and
MRR scores were used for QA. BioBERT significantly improves performance on most of the datasets.
As shown in Table 9, we sampled predictions from BERT and
BioBERT v1.1 (þPubMed) to see the effect of pre-training on downstream tasks. BioBERT can recognize biomedical named entities
that BERT cannot and can find the exact boundaries of named

6 Conclusion
In this article, we introduced BioBERT, which is a pre-trained language representation model for biomedical text mining. We showed
that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora is crucial in applying
it to the biomedical domain. Requiring minimal task-specific
architectural modification, BioBERT outperforms previous models
on biomedical text mining tasks such as NER, RE and QA.
The pre-released version of BioBERT has already
been shown to be very effective in many biomedical text mining tasks
such as NER for clinical notes , human
phenotype-gene RE and clinical temporal RE . The following updated versions of BioBERT will be available to the bioNLP community: (i) BioBERTBASE and BioBERTLARGE
trained on only PubMed abstracts without initialization from the existing BERT model and (ii) BioBERTBASE and BioBERTLARGE trained on
domain-specific vocabulary based on WordPiece.
