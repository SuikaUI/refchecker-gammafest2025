LEVEL SETS AND CONTINUITY
OF CONJUGATE CONVEX FUNCTIONS
R. T. ROCKAFELLAR(i)
1. Introduction.
A proper convex function on a vector space F over the real
numbers/? is an everywhere-defined function/with
values in (— oo, + co], not
identically + co, such that
/(Ax, + (1 -A)x2) Ú A/U.) + (1 -A)/(x2)
for all x, e F, x2 e F, 0 < A < 1. Its effective domain is the nonempty convex set
dorn/ = {x e F |/(x) < oo}.
A finite-valued convex function on a nonempty convex set C in F can always
be extended to a proper convex function on F by assigning it the value + oo
outside of C.
Let F and G be real vector spaces in duality with respect to a bilinear functional
(x,y) for xeF
and yeG (see [1, p. 48]). We shall henceforth assume F and G
have each been supplied with a topology compatible with this duality [1, p. 67],
so that each can be identified with the space of continuous linear functional
the other. Unless explicit notice is given, all questions of closure, continuity
and boundedness refer to these given topologies. The formulas
g(y) = sup{(x, y) - f(x) \xeF} for all yeG,
f(x) = sup{(x, y) - g(y) | y e G} for all x e F,
define a one-to-one
correspondence
between the lower semicontinuous
proper convex functions f on F and the l.s.c. proper convex functions g on G.
Functions paired by (1.3a) and (1.3b) are said to be conjugate to each other.
This conjugate correspondence,
discovered by Fenchel , was extended to
infinite-dimensional
spaces by Moreau and Brondsted .
It is natural to look for interesting relationships between the conjugate correspondence among convex functions and two classical correspondences,
between convex sets and their support functions, and the polar correspondence

LEVEL SETS AND CONTINUITY
for convex cones. Such is our motivation here. A fact which is already known,
and which will be important in our investigations, is that the two classical correspondences can be treated as special examples of the conjugate correspondence
in the following way.
Example 1A. A l.s.c. proper convex function is an indicator function, i.e.
has no values other than 0 and + oo, if and only if its conjugate is positively
homogeneous. The functions of the first kind on F are precisely of the form
f(x) — ôc(x) = ô(x I C), where C is a nonempty closed convex set and
ô(x | C) = 0 if x e C, (x | C) = oo if x ^ C.
The conjugate of 6C is the support function ac of C, where
(¡¿y) = a(y \ C) = sup{(x, y)\xe C) for all y eG.
Dually, the indicator functions of the nonempty closed convex sets in G are the
conjugates of the support functions of these sets, which are precisely the positively
homogeneous l.s.c. proper convex functions on F.
Example IB. According to Example 1A, a l.s.c. proper convex function is a
positively homogeneous indicator function if and only if its conjugate is also.
Such functions are the indicator functions of nonempty closed convex cones
(with vertex at the origin). For two such cones K^ F and Ls G,f'=
g = ÔL are conjugate to one another if and only if K and L are polar to one
another, i.e.
L = {yeG\(x,y)
z^O for all xeK},
K = (xeF|(x,>>) gO for all yeL}.
In particular,
the annihilator
correspondence
between subspaces of F and G
may be expressed by the conjugacy of indicator functions of subspaces.
Associated with any 1 .s.c. proper convex function/on
F are various distinguished
convex sets, cones, and positively homogeneous convex functions. What happens
to all these objects under the above correspondence?
That is the underlying
question throughout this paper.
One important convex set associated with/is its effective domain (1.2). Another
is its supergraph gph/, which is the convex set in F © R consisting of the points
lying above or on the graph off. Evidently, a proper convex function is positively
homogeneous if and only if its supergraph is actually a convex cone. Now for
each convex set there is a special convex cone, called its asymptotic cone, essentially
giving the directions in which the set is infinite. In the case of gph /, we shall
see that the asymptotic cone is itself the supergraph of a certain positively homogeneous l.s.c. proper convex function on F, which we call the asymptotic function
of/. This asymptotic function
describes important
growth properties of /.
turns out to be the support function of the closure of the effective domain
R. T. ROCKAFELLAR
the conjugate g oî f. Dually, the support function of the closure of dorn / is
the asymptotic function of g. We shall show that this can be viewed as a limiting
case of the conjugacy formulas for scalar multiples of given functions.
Each l.s.c. proper convex function /on
F also gives rise to a large family of
level sets
{x |/(x) + ß = (x, b)} for beG and ßeR,
each of which is a closed convex set in F. For any fixed h, the union of the Lhiß f
as ß ranges over R is dorn/. It is clear from (1.7a) and (1.3a) that Lhißf decreases
as ß increases, with
g(b) = sup {ße R \ LhJ * <b}.
Likewise, the conjugate function g generates closed convex sets
Laag = {y | g(y) + a ^ (a, y)} for a e F and cteR,
decreasing in a for each a, such that
/(a) = sup{aeR|La<ag#0}.
The study of these level sets will lead us to interesting results relating boundedncss
and continuity properties of/and
g. We shall only consider cases where ß < g(b)
and a <f(a),
so that the level sets are sure to be nonempty. The marginal cases
where ß = g(b) and a =f(a)
involve special problems treated in the theory of
subdifferentials of convex functions. (See , and the references given there.)
Our first task in analyzing these level sets will be to determine their support
functions. The level sets Laxg under consideration
correspond one-to-one with
the points (a, a) in F © R which do not belong to gph/.
The supergraph of the
support function of Laag turns out to be the projecting cone of gph/from
From the support function formulas, we shall deduce the following boundedness
principle: Lbßfis bounded for all ß if and only if b is an internal point of dorn g
(i.e., along each line through b, g is finite on an open segment containing b).
Starting with a locally convex Hausdorff topological vector space E, we can
always let F = E and let G be the dual E* of E, with (x, y) = y(x) for y e E*.
Our results can then be applied if the topology on G is taken as the weak* topology
(see [1, p. 67]). Of course if E is reflexive the strong topology on E* could also
be used. Even if E is not reflexive, however, our boundedness
principle leads
to a continuity theorem in this context. We shall see, namely, that the internal
points of dorn g are precisely the points where the conjugate function g is finite
and continuous in the strong topology on the E*. When E is tonnelé (in particular
when E is a Banach space or is reflexive, see [1, p. 2 and p. 89]), there is a dual
theorem: points where/is
finite and continuous correspond to weak* compact
level sets of g.
LEVEL SETS AND CONTINUITY
The last result also follows from recent independent work of Moreau. In ,
which appeared shortly after our paper was submitted for publication, Moreau
proved that the points where / is finite and continuous in the Mackey topology
x(F, G) correspond to the level sets of g which are compact in the weak topology
a(G, F). In a tonnelé space, of course, the given topology coincides with the
Mackey topology induced by the dual space. Moreau's method of proof could
also be used for a more direct derivation of our theorem on boundedness, without
employing the formulas for the support functions of level sets.
We also want to mention along these lines the recently published theorem of
Fan about polar convex sets. It is closely related to the case of Moreau's
theorem where/is the support function of a convex set in G.
2. Convex cones associated with convex sets. For each nonempty convex set
C in F and each a e F, the set
Z\,C = cl{A(x-a)|A>0,
where "cl" denotes closure, is the projecting cone of C relative to a. It is the
smallest closed convex cone containing the translated convex set C — a. (This
definition differs slightly from the classical one, in which the cone is not required
to be closed and its vertex is at a rather than at the origin.) Another important
closed convex cone associated with a nonempty convex set C is its asymptotic
cone 0+ C, which is defined as the "limit" of AC as X Í 0, i.e.
0+C = f| fcl U Acl.
e>0 L 0<A<«
We want to mention here some properties of these cones which will be invoked
later in the case where C is replaced by the supergraph of a convex function.
Asymptotic cones seem to have been considered first by Stoker . Choquet
 has recently studied them in infinite-dimensional spaces. The characterizations
of 0+C listed for convenience in the following theorem are all known.
Theorem 2A. If C is a nonempty closed convex set in F, each of the four
conditions on xeF
given below is equivalent to the condition that xe0+C:
(a) the ray {a + Ax | X ^ 0} is contained in C for every aeC;
(b) there exists some aeC
such that a + Xxe C for arbitrarily
large choices
(c) C + x s C;
(d) (x, y) g 0 for every yeG such that the linear function (• ,y) is bounded
above on C.
Proof. By definition (2.2) the condition that xe0+ C can be expressed as:
(e) there exist nets of scalars X¡ > 0 and vectors x,eC
such that lin^-A,- = 0
and lim¡ X¡ x¡ = x.
R. T. ROCKAFELLAR
The equivalence of this with the four conditions in the theorem will be established
by a cycle of implications.
(a) implies (c): Trivial (take A = 1).
(c) implies (b): Fix any aeC.
Then a + nxeC
for all positive integers n by
induction.
(b) implies (e): Choose any unbounded
increasing sequence of //,- > 0 such
that a + u¡x = x¡ e C. Let A, = 1 / ¡it. Then lim;A; = 0 and \iialXlxi = x.
(c) implies (d): \f(a,y)
for all aeC, then
(x, y) = lim,X£xby) \% a. ■ lim,A, = 0.
(d) implies (a): If (a,y)z%aeR
for all aeC
we have (a + Ax,y) ^ a for all
aeC and A ^ 0 by (d). Since a closed convex set is the intersection of the closed
half-spaces containing it, this finishes the proof.
Characterization
(d) says that 0+C is polar to the cone cl(dom <rc) in G, which
might be called the barrier cone of C (see [7, p. 45]).
Our scalar multiple notation for the asymptotic cone of a nonempty
convex set C fits in with various algebraic formulas in a helpful way. For example,
consider the formulas
Xi(X2 C) = (X2X2)C and (A, + X2)C = XtC + X2C,
which are obvious when At > 0 and A2 > 0.
There are similar formulas, easily verified from Theorem 2A, which involve
the asymptotic cone, namely 0+(A2C) = 0+C, A^O+C) = 0+C, 0+(0+C) = 0+C,
0+C = 0+C + 0+C, X2C = 0+C + X2C. We can summarize all of these by
saying that (2.3) holds for all At ^ 0+ and A2 ^ 0+. The notation also suggests
that the set
UUiCi + •- + kd | A, ^ 0+, -, Xk ^ 0+, Ax + ... + Xk = 1}
ought to be more important in some contexts than the mere convex hull of given
closed convex sets C1( —, Q (which is what (2.4) would be ifthe result of multiplying by zero were interpreted as 0C¡ = {0} instead of 0+C¡). As a matter of fact,
Choquet has shown that (2.4) often gives the closed convex hull of Cu —, Ck.
The following projecting cone formula, which also benefits from the 0+notation
is already known. Since it will be crucial in this paper, a proof is included for,
completeness.
Theorem 2B (Choquet
 ). If C is a nonempty closed convex set in F and
P.C - (J {A[C- a] |Ae0+}.
Proof. Let K denote the union of the right. It is clear from definition (2.1)
that cl K=>PaC. Furthermore, PaC is closed and PaC 3 X\C - a] for all A >0,
LEVEL SETS AND CONTINUITY
so PaC 2 0+[C - a] from definition (2.2) . Thus PaC 2 K. It remains to show
K 2 ci X. Ifxecl
K, we can choose nets such that x = lim,-z¡ where z¡ e X¡[C — a],
X — 0+. Taking a subnet if necessary we can suppose the A¡ are all strictly positive,
for otherwise xe0+[C
- a] ç K trivially because 0+[C — a] is closed. Set,
z, = X¡x¡, where x¡e C — a. Since a$C and C is a closed convex set, there exists
by a standard separation theorem some beG such that (z - a, b) = 1 for all
zeC. Hence
lim sup¡A¡ = ]ha¡kXxl3 b) = (x, b) < co .
We may suppose therefore that lim;A; = A, where 0 g A < oo. If A > 0, we have
(1/A) = limpCjeC - a, so xeX\C — à]. If A = 0, xeO+[C — a\ by definition.
in both cases, so cl K ç K.
Remark. The asymptotic cone and projecting cones of a nonempty closed
convex set C were defined using the closure operation. But the characterization
of 0 + C in Theorem 2A(c), and the formula for PaC in Theorem 2B when a£C,
show that these cones could also be defined algebraically. They do not depend
on the particular topology, except to the extent that the topology has to be one
in which C is closed.
3. Asymptotic functions and scalar multiplication. There is a natural one-to-one
correspondence between extended-real-valued
functions/on
their supergraphs
gph/={<x,p>|xeF,/(x)gpeK}
in F © R. For the case of interest here, the correspondence
is characterized
the following lemma, whose proof is straightforward
and will be omitted.
Lemma 3A. In order that a subset S of F © R be of the form gphffor
(unique) l.s.c. proper convex function f on F, it is necessary and sufficient that
S be a nonempty closed convex set with <0, I>e0+S
and — <0,1)^0
For the rest of this section let/ be l.s.c. proper convex on F, and let g be its,
conjugate on G. In view of Lemma 3A, we can define nonnegative right scalar
multiples fX off, all of which are again l.s.c. proper convex, by the geometric
gph (/A ) = A gph/for A = 0+ .
Evidently,
(/A)(x) = ;/((l/A)x)for
We shall call/0+the asymptotic function off. Its properties will now be described.
Theorem 3B. Each of the following conditions on xe F and ¡ie R is equivalent
to the condition that (/0+) ( x) g /<:
R. T. ROCKAFELLAR
(a) /(a + Ax) úf(a)
+ Xp for ail a e F and A ^ 0;
(b) there exists some a e dorn f such that f (a + Ax) g/(a)
+ Xp for arbitrarily
large choices of X;
(c) /(z + x) -/(z)
all ze dorn/;
(d) (x, y) i£ p/or all yeG with g(y) < oo ;
(e) i/iere exist directed nets of vectors x¡eF and X¡ > 0 such that \\m¡X¡ = 0,
lim,A,Xj = x and Yim¡X¡f(x¡) g p.
Proof. By definition (3.2) of/0+, we have (/0+)(x) g p if and only if <x,//>
is in the asymptotic cone of the set gph/in
(3.1). Conditions (a), (b),(c) and (e) are
easily derived from the corresponding conditions in Theorem 2A. Condition (d)
could also be derived from the earlier (d), but it is simpler to show it is equivalent
to the present (c). If (c) holds, we actually have —f(z) z% p —f(z + x) for all
zeF, so by (1.3a)
g(y) = sup_.{(z, y) -f(z)}
g sup2{(z, y) + M - f(z + x)}
» H - (x, y) + supz{(z + x, y) -f(z + x)} = p - (x, y) + g(y).
Hence p — (x, y) ^ 0 whenever g(y) < oo. On the other hand, if (d) holds, we see
from (1.3b) that
f(z + x) = sup,{(z + x, y) - g(y)}
g sup{(x, y) | g(y) < oo} + sup{(z, y) - g(y) \ g(y) < oo}
for all x e F. Thus (c) holds in this case.
3C. The asymptotic function
of f can be determined from any
of the following formulas:
(/0+) (x) = sup {f (a + Ax) - /(a)] / Xfor any a e dorn/;
(/0+) (x) = lim [f (a + Ax) - /(a)] / Xfor any a e dom/;
(/0+) (x) - sup {/(z + x) - /(z) I z e dorn/} ;
(/0+) (x) = sup {(x, y) | g(y) < co } ;
(/0+) (x) = lim inf {X¡f(x¡) | A, > 0, X¡ -* 0, A,x, -► x}
= lim inf {(fX¡) (z() | A, > 0, X, -> 0, z¡ -► x} .
Proof, (a), (c), (d) and (e) are immediate from the conditions in 3B; (b) is
equivalent to (a), because the difference quotient is a nondecreasing function
of A > 0 (e.g. see ).
LEVEL SETS AND CONTINUITY
is positively homogeneous;
it is the support
function of the nonempty closed convex set cl(dom g) in G.
Proof. This is the essence of 3C(d); cf. Example 1A.
Properties of asymptotic functions reduce to those of asymptotic cones when
/is the indicator function of a closed convex set C. Indeed,
(/A) (x) = 8(x | XC) for all A = 0+ if/Yx) - 8(x \ C).
It is natural to define left scalar multiples Xf of/ for A = 0+ by
(Xf) (x) = A[/(x)] if A > 0, (0V) (x) = 8(x | cl dom/).
Then each A/is again l.s.c. proper convex, and gph (0+/) ¡s the "limit" of gph
(Xf) as A J, 0. Left and right scalar multiplication are dual to one another in the
sense of the following theorem, which combines a known elementary fact for
A>0 with 3D (cf. 1 A).
Theorem 3E. Xf and fX are conjugate to gX and Xg, respectively, for all X ^ 0+.
Another reason for our "right scalar multiple" notation is provided by the
next theorem.
Theorem 3F. Let (¡> be the function on RQ F defined by: (¡>(X,x) = (fX)(x)
for A > 0, (f>(0,x) = (f0+)(x), <j)(X,x) = oo for X < 0. Then <p is l.s.c. proper
convex and positively homogeneous. In fact tj> is the support function
in G © R, if R © F and G ©/? are placed in duality with respect to
(<A, x>, <y, ¿i» = (x, y) - Xp.
If R © F © R and R © G ©/Î are placed in duality with respect to
(<A, x, //'>, <A', y, p}) = (x, y) - Xp - X'p',
and \j/ is the function
on R © G constructed from g as <¡> was from f, then
gphtf £ jR© F© R and gpht/fSR ©G ®R areclosed convex cones polar to each
Proof. By (3.2) and 2B, gph <j> is the smallest closed convex cone in R © F © R
containing «1, x, p} | <x, /x> e gph/}.
Hence 4> is a positively homogeneous l.s.c. proper convex function on R © F
by the criterion in Lemma 3A. By Theorem 3E, the conjugate of (¡> with respect
to (3.5) is
sup {«A, x>, <y, p» - <t>(X,
x) |<A, x> e R © F}
= sup {sup {(x, y) - Xp- (fX) (x) | x e F} | A ^ 0 +}
= sup { - Xp + (Xg) (y) | A = 0+} = <r«y, p) \ gph g).
R. T. ROCKAFELLAR
Thus q} is the support function of gph g (cf. 1A). In view of the dual of the first
assertion in the proof, the polar of the cone gph \¡i with respect to (3.6) consists
of all <A, x, p'> eR ®F@R
0 ^ «A, x, p'>, <1, >>, p» = (<A, x>, (y, p» - p
for all <y, p> e gph g. Thus it consists of all <A, x, p'> with
p' ^ ff(<A, x> | gph g) = </>(A,
x), i.e. it is gph </>.
Remark. The correspondences in Theorem 3F were noted by Fenchel, and they
apparently helped motivate his original definition of the conjugate correspondence
(cf. and [7, p. 88 ff.]). Our only contribution here has been to formalize and
complete Fenchel's observations in terms of asymptotic functions.
4. Support functions of level sets. Just as the asymptotic function of a 1 .s.c.
proper convex /on
F was defined geometrically by means of the asymptotic cone
of the closed convex set gph/, we can construct other functions from/considering
the projecting cones of gph/relative
to various points <a,a> of E © R. These
will turn out to be the support functions of the level sets of the conjugate g off,
just as/0+,was
the support function of the union of these sets, dorn g.
Indeed, in view of Theorem 2B and Lemma 3A, we can define a positively
homogeneous
l.s.c. proper convex function Paa/on
F for each <a,a>^gph/
by the formula
(4.1) gph(PtttXf)
= P<a>a>gPh/=
(J {¿[(gph/) - <«. *>] IA éÍ 0+}.
Of course, <a, a> £ gph/if
and only if a <f(a),
and in this case the closed convex
level set Laxg is sure to be nonempty (see (1.7b) and (1.8b)).
Theorem 4A. The function
the following
aeF and a <f(a)):
(a) (Pa,J)(x)
= min{(nA)(x) | A ^ 0+} with h(x) =f(a + x) - a;
(b) (Pà,J)(x)
= inf{[/(a 4- Ax) - f(a) + e] /A| A > 0}, where e =/(a) - a,
provided that f(a) < oo;
(c) (Pa,J)
(x) = sup {(x,y)\g(y)zi
(a, y) -a},
of the level set Laxg.
Proof. Formula (a) follows from (4.1), because A[(gph/) - <a, a>] = gph(ñA)
for all A ^ 0+ by the definitions. If oo > e =/(a)
- a = n(0), we have
(n0+) (x) = lim [7i(Ax) - /t(0)] / A = lim [/(a + Ax) - f(a) + e] / A
by 3C(b). On the other hand,
[ñ(l / A)] (x) = h(Xx) IX = If (a + Ax) - /(a) + e] /A for 0 < A < oo
LEVEL SETS AND CONTINUITY
by the definition of right scalar multiplication.
Therefore (a) implies (b) when
./'(«) < oo. We can also calculate the conjugate of Pa>or/from (a) and 3E as
sup{(x,y) - min{(/?A)(x) \X = 0+}\xeF}
= sup {sup{(x, y) - (hX) (x) | x e F} \ X = 0+j
= sup{(A/c)(y) | A = 0 + } = 8(y \ k(y) Í 0),
where k denotes the conjugate of h. Since
k(y) = sup{(x, y) - [/(a
+ x) - a] | x e F} = g(y) - (a, j') + a,
we have k(y) = 0 if and only if g(y) g (a, y) — a, i.e. y e La ag. Thus the conjugate
of Pa,af is the indicator
so that we must have (Pa>ir/)(x)
= a(x | L^g) as in 1A.
sup((x, b) \f(x) = 0} = mm{(gX) (b) \ X = 0 + }.

inf{g(Ay)/A|A>0}.
Proof. By the dual of 4A, all of these expressions give (P0,oS) (&)•
We shall now prove the boundedness principle mentioned in the introduction.
Theorem 4C Let beG and ß < g(b). Then the (nonempty) level set LbJf
is bounded in F if and only ifb is an internal point of dorn g.
Proof. A nonempty closed convex subset of F is bounded in the given topology,
if and only if it is bounded in the weak topology G induces on F (see [1, p. 70]),
i.e. its support function is finite throughout
G. Thus, by the dual of 4A, Lbl¡f
is bounded if and only if
G = dom(PMg) = (J {dom(/cA)
| A = 0+},
where k(y) = g(b + y) — ß. On the other hand, b is an internal point of dorn g
if and only if
G = U {A[(dom
g) - £>] | A > 0} = IJ {A dorn k\X>0}.
Since by definition of right scalar multiplication
dom (kX) = X dom k for A > 0,
we know (4.4) implies (4.3). Now assume (4.3) holds. For any z e dom k, select
A = 0+ such that -zedom(ArA).
If A > 0, the line segment connecting z and
( —11 X.)z lies entirely in the convex set dom/c, and contains 0. If A = 0+, the
half-line {z + p( — z) \ p ^ 0} lies entirely in dom k, because
R. T. ROCKAFELLAR
oo > (fcO + )(-z)
= sup{[/c(z + p(-z)) - k(z)]lp\ p > 0}
by 3C(a); this half line again contains 0. At all events, we therefore have 0 e dorn k,
i.e. g(b) < oo. It now follows from the dual of 4A(b) that
(Pbtßg)(y) = inf [g(b + py) -ßMp = M(kX)(y).
Thus dorn (fc0+) can be omitted from the union in (4.3), so that (4.3) implies
(4.4) by (4.5).
4D. lfLbßfis
bounded for some ß< g(b), then it is bounded for
every ße R.
5. Properties of effective domains.
In this section we shall dualize some
properties of the effective domains of a conjugate pair of functions / and g.
First we shall generalize a fact noted by Phelps . Suppose C S F and
/>£ G are convex sets polar to one another. Let/= oD and g=öD as in Example 1 A. We
have C = L0_if
(this is the definition of polarity), and it is apparent that/can
also be viewed as the gauge function of C. Phelps proved that a point b e D is
an extreme point ofD, (i.e. b does not belong to any open line segment lying in D)
if and only if the convex set of differences Cb — Cb is dense in F, where
Cb = {x e F | crD(x) g (x, b) + 1} = Lb>-J.
Of course D = dorn g here, and — 1 < g(b) = 0. The following theorem shows
that a similar result is valid for any conjugate/and
Theorem5A.
Let beâorag
and ß < g(b). Then b is an extreme point of
domg in G if and only ifLbißf— Lbtßfis dense in F.
Proof. Let L be the closure of Lbßf — Lbßf, which is a nonempty convex set
in F. We have
a(y | L) = sup {(x1 - x2, y) \ x, e Lbißf, x2 e Lbpf}
= aiy | LbJf)
= (Pbt„g)(y) + (Pb,ßg)(-y)
by the dual of 4A. Since the correspondence
beetween closed convex sets of
their support functions is one-to-one, we conclude that L = F if and only if the
last expression in (5.1) equals -f oo for all y ^ 0. But
(Pb,ßg) (±y)
= inf {[g(b ± Xy) - ß] / A | A > 0}
by the dual of 4A(b), inasmuch as g(b) < oo by hypothesis. Thus
pb,f(y) + P„.ß(-y)
for some y i= 0 if and only if b is the midpoint of an open line segment between
some b — Xye dorn g and b + Xye dom g, i.e., b is not an extreme point.
LEVEL SETS AND CONTINUITY
The next theorem answers the question of when the conjugate of a given function
is finite everywhere.
Theorem 5B. dom g is dense in G if and only if
(/0+) (x) = oo for all x # 0.
One actually has dom g = G, if and only if
Lbßf is bounded for all beE and ßeR.
Proof, dom g is dense if and only if0 + gis identically zero, and this is equivalent
to (5.2) because/0 + is the conjugate of 0+g by 3E. We observe next that dom g = G
if and only if every b e G is an internal point of dom g. By Theorem 4C, this is
equivalent to Lbßf being bounded whenever ß < g(b), which is trivially the
same as (5.3).
5C. If F is finite-dimensional,
conditions (5.2) and (5.3) are equivalent.
Proof. A convex set dense in a finite-dimensional
space must itself be the
whole space.
6. Asymptotic and projecting cones of level sets. Throughout
this section it is
still assumed that/and
g are l.s.c. proper convex functions on Fand G conjugate
to each other.
Theorem 6A. For each beG and ß < g(b), the asymptotic cone 0+Lbßfand
the projecting
cone P6(dom g) are polar to each other.
Proof. According to characterization (d) in Theorem 2A, the asymptotic cone
of a nonempty closed convex set C in F is polar to the closure of the effective
domain of the support function of C in G. The support function of C = Lbßfh
Pb,ßf> by the dual of 4A(c). The closure of the effective domain of Pbißg is
obviously the closed convex cone generated by (dom g) — b, i.e. it is Pfc(dom g).
6B. For each beG, all the nonempty level sets of the form Lbßf
have the same asymptotic
Proof. The theorem trivially implies 0+Lbßf is the same for all ß < g(b).
This cone can be described as the set of x such that f(z + Xx) — (z + Xx, b)
is a nonincreasing function of A for every z. If Lbßf happens to be nonempty
for ß = g(b), its asymptotic cone includes these vectors, too. On the other hand,
its asymptotic cone must be contained in the asymptotic cone of the other level
sets, which are larger.
6C. The set of vectors x such that
R. T. ROCKAFELLAR
f(z + x)£f(z) forait zeF
is a closed convex cone in F whose polar is the smallest closed convex cone in
G containing dom g.
Proof. The set of vectors x satisfying (6.1) is the common asymptotic cone
of the level sets L0 ß for ß < g(0), according to characterization (c) in Theorem 2A.
The fact that the vectors satisfying (6.1) form a closed convex cone was used
extensively by the author in .
Theorem 6D. Given any level set Lb ßf, where ß < g(b), and any point
a $ Lbßf, let a be the real number such that a + ß = (a, b). Then dually a <f(a)
and b$Laxg,
and the projecting
PAWßf) and P¿L.ftg)
are polar to each other.
Proof. Since a $Lbßf if and only if/(a)
+ ß > (a, b), the hypothesis is selfdual. The conjugate of Pa<J is the indicator function of La xg, whose effective
domain is Lxag itself, so, by 6A and 6B, Pb Laxg is the polar of the asymptotic
cone of any nonempty level set of the form Lbil¡(Ptttttf). Since P„>tI/is positively
homogeneous, we can take p = 0. The level set in question is then a convex
cone, and hence it coincides with its asymptotic
cone. Thus the problem is to
{x | (PaJ)
(x) è (x, b)} = Pu(Lb<ßj).
/j(x) =f(a + x) - a =f(a + x) - (a, b) + ß.
By formula 4A(a) for Pa,xf, the left side of (6.2) consists of the vectors x such
that (hX)(x) - (x, b) for some A = 0+. In view of formula 2B for projecting
cones, (6.2) will therefore certainly follow from proving that
{x | (hX) (x) = (x, b)} = X[(Lb¡l¡f) - a] for each A = 0+ .
If A is positive, both sides of (6.3) are equivalent to
f(a + (I IX)x) + ß = (a + (I IX)x,b).
On the other hand, suppose that A = 0+, and fix any c e (Lb„/)
- a. By Theorem
2A, x belongs to the right side of (6.3) if and only if the ray {c + px \ p = 0} is
contained in (Lbßf) — a, in other words
f(a + c + px) + ß g (a + c + px, b) for all p^O.
LEVEL SETS AND CONTINUITY
But this is the same as
h(c + px) 1% p(x, b) for all p ^ 0.
in other words (/i0+)(x) g (x, b). Thus (6.3) is also true when A = 0+.
6E. Iff(0)
> 0 > inf/,
the closed convex cone generated
{x \f(x) g 0} is polar to the closed convex cone generated
by {y | g(y) £j 0}.
Proof. Take a = b = 0 and ß = 0, and use the fact that g(0) = —inf/.
7. Boundedness and continuity. Local continuity properties will now be investigated using our main result about boundedness,
Theorem 4C. It will help us
here if we change notation and look at the conjugate correspondence
another point of view.
Let £ be a locally convex Hausdorff topological vector space over R, and let
E* be its dual, with (x,x*) written instead of x*(x). The formula
/*(**) = sup {(x,x*)-/(x)|xe£}
for all x*e£*
defines a conjugate operation which takes certain functions on £ into functions
on £*, just as the adjoint operation takes linear transformations £ -» £ into transformations £* -*£*. If the operation is applied twice, one has
/*%***) = sup {(x*,x**)-/*(x*)|x*e£*}
for all x**e£**,
where £** is the bidual of £. Of course, £ and £* are in duality with respect to
(x,x*), and the original topology on £ and the weak* topology on £* are compatible with this duality [1, p. 69]. Hence, the results proved in earlier sections
can be applied in the new notational system, with £ = £,£*
= G, x* = y, f* =g,
etc., provided the G topology is interpreted as the weak* topology. If£ is reflexive,
the strong topology on £* may be used instead. For example, the basic facts
about conjugacy may now be viewed as follows: The conjugates /* of the l.s.c
proper convex functions / on £ are precisely the weak* l.s.c. proper convex
functions on £*. (Such functions are a fortiori
strongly l.s.c,
but in the nonreflexive case there will be strongly l.s.c. proper convex functions on £* which are
not of the form /*.) Furthermore,
the restriction of /** to £ (considered as a
subspace of £**) is/. We assume, of course, here and henceforth, that / is l.s.c.
proper convex on £.
The derived functions/*0
+ and Pfl.>a./*, fora* </*(a*),
do not depend on the
topology being considered on £*, since they arise algebraically from / through
(7.1) and formulas like those in 3C and 4A. Caution must be used with 0+/*,
however, because the weak* closure of a convex set in £* can be larger than its
strong closure in the nonreflexive case. It may be deduced from 4A(c) that
(PaJ)** - P„,a(/**) when a e £ and a < f(a) = /**(a).
R. T. ROCKAFELLAR
Thus Pa¡xf is the restriction of PUjCI(/**) to £. It is also true that /0+
is the restriction of/**0+
to £ (see 3C(d)), but/**0+
is not always the same as (/0+)**
(e.g. when dorn/* is weak* dense in £* but not strongly dense). The relationship
between the level sets of/and
those of its "bi-conjugate"
is quite simple. For each
a* e £* and a* </*(a*),
La.iCt./** is the closure of £„«,„»/ in the weak topology
on £** induced by £*. This follows from the fact that, by the appropriate versions
of 4A(c), both of these convex sets can be viewed as having the same support
function Pa.iCt./* on £*. (Consider first the duality between £ and £* and then that
between £** and £*.)
We shall now prove a continuity
theorem having many consequences.
relationship between this result and the one of Moreau has already been
pointed out in §1.
Theorem 7A.
(a) For any a* <f*(a*),
La,<x»f is bounded
if and only if f*
is finite and
strongly continuous at a*.
(b) IfE is tonnelé then, for any a <f(a),
f is finite and continuous at a if and
only ifLxaf*
is weak* compact.
Proof. If/*
is finite and strongly continuous at a*, then a* is an internal
point of dorn/*. The converse of this fact will be enough to prove (a) , in view
of Theorem 4C. Suppose a* is internal to dom/*.
Since /* is already strongly
l.s.c. at a*, we can verify strong continuity at a* by showing that, for arbitrary
U* = {x* e £* \f*(a* + x*) ^/*(a*)
is a strong neighborhood of the origin. Now, U* is the polar of the set
l/£ = {xe£|(x,x*)^l|
for all x*eU*},
because t/* is a weak* closed convex subset of £* containing 0 (see [1, p. 52]).
In addition, U* is absorbent. This results from the assumption that a* is an
internal point of dom/*,
since a convex function is automatically continuous
along any open line segment where it is finite (see ). Therefore Ue is weakly
bounded, and hence bounded in the initial topology on £. Thus U*is the polar
of bounded set in £, which, by definition, means that U* is a neighborhood
in the strong topology on £*.
Applying (a) to £* in place of E, we see that, for a e£ and a </**(a)
Laaf* is strongly bounded in £* if and only if/**
is finite and continuous
in the strong topology on £**. When £ is tonnelé, the closed and strongly bounded
convex sets in £* are the weak* compact ones [1, p. 65 and p. 86], and the initial
topology on E is the same as its relative topology as a subspace of £** [1, p. 87].
Inasmuch as /** coincides with / on E, this proves (b).
LEVEL SETS AND CONTINUITY
7B./* is continuous at a* in the strong topology if and only if,
along each line through a*, the restriction off*
is continuous at a*.
Proof. The condition is trivially necessary. Its sufficiency when f*(a*) < oo
follows from 7A and 4C, because it implies a* is an internal point of dom /*.
(A finite convex function on an open line segment is always continuous, as pointed
out above.) When f*(a*) = oo, /* is strongly continuous at a* trivially, since
it is strongly l.s.c.
7C. IfE is tonnelé, f is continuous at every internal point of its
effective domain.
If a is an internal point of dom/, the level sets La „/*are
bounded by
4C. But closed bounded convex subsets of the dual of a tonnelé space arc weak*
compact. Thus/is
continuous at a by 7A(b) when E is tonnelé.
ID. If La, „,/ is bounded for some a* <f*(a*),
then there exists
a strong neighborhood
U* of a* in E* such that Lb. ß,f is bounded for all b* e U*
Let U* be the interior of dom/* in the strong topology. The hypothesis
implies that a*e 17* by 7A(a). Every point of U* is internal to dom/*,
conclusion now follows for b* e U* and ß* <f*(b*)
by 4C. The extension to the
case where ß* ^f*(b*)
is trivial.
The first part of the next corollary has already been noted by Hörmander
[8, Theorem 7].
7E. A nonempty closed convex set C in E is bounded if and only
if its support function
is strongly continuous
throughout
is tonnelé,
a nonempty closed convex set C* in E* is weak* compact if and only if its support
function on E is continuous everywhere.
In the first case take,/=
8C and/* = ac as in Example 1A and apply
7A(a). In the second case, take/=
<rc.,/* = 8C* and apply 7A(b).
7F. Let K be a nonempty closed convex cone in E, {0} i= K ^ E,
and let K* be its polar in E*. Then — a* belongs to the strong interior of K*
if and only if {xeK\(x,a*)
= 1} is nonempty and bounded. If E is tonnelé,
— a is interior to K if and only if {x* e K* | (a, x*) = 1} is nonempty and weak*
Proof. Let f=8K
and /* = 8K, as in Example IB. Then L_0._,/
= {xeK\(x,a*)
^ 1}. Since K contains more than just 0, this set is bounded
if and only if {x e K | (x, a*) = 1} is nonempty and bounded. The first conclusion
of the corollary now follows from 7A(a). The second conclusion is derived likewise from 7A(b).
R. T. ROCKAFELLAR
Just as boundedness of level sets is dual to continuity at points, boundedness
of effective domains is dual to uniform continuity. We shall prove this now as
our final result.

is finite and uniformly strongly continuous,
we must have
dom(/*0 + ) = £* by formula 3C(c). This implies dom/is
weakly bounded (and
hence bounded) by the dual of 3C(d). Conversely, suppose dom/is
bounded. Then
/*0+ is finite and strongly continuous on E* by 7E, because it is the support
function of cl(dom/).
\f*(y*)-f*(z*)\
z%max{(f*0+)(y* - z*),(/*0+)(z* - y*)}
for all y* e E* and z* e E* by 3C(c), so we can conclude from this that /* is
finite and uniformly strongly continuous.
The second part of the corollary is
proved similarly.
Remark. Suppose dom / is bounded, and let
(7.5) p(x*) = sup{|(x,x*)|
= max{(/*0+)(x*),(/*0+)(-x*)j
(see 3C(d)). Then p is a strongly continuous seminorm on £* by definition of the
strong topology. According to the proof above, we have
\f*(y*) -f*(z*) | g p(y* - z*) for all y* e £* and z* e £*.
In fact p is the smallest function with this property, because
p(x*) = sup{\f*(y*) -f*(z*)|
\y* - z* = x*}
by formula 3C(c) for/*0+.
If £ is a normed linear space, it is immediate from
these facts that
