In this paper thesemethods will be discussedfrom a new perspective.
The goal is to addressthe non-symmetricproblem and thus the focusis on
the Arnoldi algorithm. However,sincethe Arnoldi method reducesto the
Lanczosmethod when the matrix is symmetric, everything that is developedhereis applicableto the symmetriccaseaswell with obvioussavingsin
computational effort availablethrough the exploitation of symmetry. Traditionally, the point of view hasbeento let the Arnoldi or the Lanczossequence
developwithout bound while monitoring error estimatesassociatedwith the
Ritz vectorsto identify convergedeigenvalues.However,if one exploresthe
relation with the QR-iteration it is apparent that the Arnoldi (Lanczos)
method is really a truncated reduction of the given matrix into upper Hessenberg(tridiagonal) form. The iterative phaseof the QR-method doesnot
havean analogywithin the traditional treatment of thesealgorithms.
A variant of the Arnoldi method which includes suchan iterative phase
is developedhere by analogy to the well-known implicitly shifted Q-R iteration for densematrices. Suchan analogy may be developedif
one treats the residual vector as a function of the initial Arnoldi (Lanczos)
vector, and then attempts to iteratively improvethis vector in a wayto force
the residual vector to zero. As shown here, this may be done by implicit
application of a polynomial filter to the starting vector on each iteration.
The implicit application of this polynomial filter is accomplishedthrough a
truncated version of the implicitly shifted Q-R iteration. Within this context, an updating schemeis developedwhich preservesan Arnoldi (Lanczos)
factorization of predeterminedsize. The method generalizesexplicit restart
methods and it is possible to implement a mathematically equivalent im-
plicit method correspondingto all of the explicitly restarted methods that
this author is awareof (SeeSection5).
