Recommendation algorithms have been researched extensively to help people deal with abundance of information. In recent
years, the incorporation of multiple relevance criteria has attracted increased interest. Such multi-criteria recommendation
approaches are researched as a paradigm for building intelligent systems that can be tailored to multiple interest indicators
of end-users – such as combinations of implicit and explicit interest indicators in the form of ratings or ratings on multiple
relevance dimensions. Nevertheless, evaluation of these recommendation techniques in the context of real-life applications
still remains rather limited. Previous studies dealing with the evaluation of recommender systems have outlined that the
performance of such algorithms is often dependent on the dataset – and indicate the importance of carrying out careful
testing and parameterization. Especially when looking at large scale datasets, it becomes very difficult to deploy evaluation
methods that may help in assessing the effect that different system components have to the overall design. In this paper, we
study how layered evaluation can be applied for the case of a multi-criteria recommendation service that we plan to deploy
for paper recommendation using the Mendeley dataset. The paper introduces layered evaluation and suggests two
experiments that may help assess the components of the envisaged system separately.

portals such as Mendeley.com, CiteSeer ( citeulike.org and Google Scholar
( Several approaches have been presented by researchers to generate relevant
recommendations of scientific papers to end-users, in order to facilitate retrieval of relevant scientific articles
from large collections of papers offered by these portals. These approaches rely on, or extend, traditional
recommendation techniques – such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering or hybrid techniques .
Bogers and van den Bosch apply for instance three different collaborative filtering techniques to a dataset
that is crawled from citeulike.org and that contains traditional user-item preferences. Several other systems rely
on multiple data sources or criteria, or different combinations of recommendation techniques.
McNee et al. presents a hybrid approach that combines content-based and collaborative filtering
techniques to generate recommendations on the basis of citations in scientific papers. Similarly, TechLens+
 combines the citations of an article with its content in order to generate recommendations. The system
relies on a combination of collaborative and content-based recommendation techniques. Papyres is a
multi-criteria hybrid recommender system. The first level is a content-based filter that operates on LOM
metadata. The second level filters the output of this level with a multi-criteria collaborative filtering technique.
This filter considers multiple ratings on various criteria as they are provided by end-users, including the
research contribution, originality, quality of the literature review, readability and organization, technical
quality, testing procedure and quality of references. The interest in considering multiple criteria for
recommending scientific papers is discussed by several researchers such as Matsatsinis et al. and Kapoor
et al. . To our knowledge, the approach has not yet been evaluated to assess the quality of recommendations.
Evaluation of such systems can be a challenging and difficult task. Recent studies have suggested the
adoption of layered approaches in order to identify the components of a system that may affect its overall
performance . Layered evaluation (or decomposition) frameworks have attracted research attention for
more than a decade, with several frameworks, methods and instruments being proposed and tested in relevant
literature . They try to decompose a recommender system in its constituent subsystems or layers and then
apply particular evaluation methods that can assess the performance of each targeted layer. Nevertheless, we
are not aware of any recommender system evaluation study that has explicitly applied some particular layered
evaluation framework.
In this paper, we particularly focus on applying a layered evaluation framework to fit the interaction
components of a recommender system. Earlier studies have indicated that the best performing technique is
often dependent on the application context, and the dataset that is used to evaluate the approach. In our study,
we focus on a system that is based on a large dataset in order to see how it may have an influence on the
performance of the recommendation approach. More specifically, the Mendeley dataset is used as the basis
upon which a multi-criteria recommendation system may be designed. Then the multi-criteria recommendation
system to work on top of the Mendeley data is examined under the prism of a layered evaluation framework.
2. Multi-criteria collaborative filtering using the Mendeley dataset
In related research, the problem of recommendation has been identified as the way to help individuals in a
community to find the information or products that are most likely to be interesting to them or to be relevant to
their needs . It has been further refined to the problem (i) of predicting whether a particular user will like a
particular item (prediction problem), or (ii) of identifying a set of N items that will be of interest to a certain
user (top-N recommendation problem) . Therefore, the general recommendation problem can be formulated
as follows: let C be the set of all users and S the set of all possible items that can be recommended. We define
Nikos Manouselis and Katrien Verbert / Procedia Computer Science 18 1189 – 1197
a utility function
that measures the appropriateness of recommending an
item s to user c. It is assumed that this function is not known for the whole C x S space but only on some subset
of it. Therefore, in the context of recommendation, we want for each user c to be able to:
(i) estimate (or approach) the utility function
for an item s of the space S for which
is not yet
known; or,
(ii) choose a set of N items
that will maximize
In most recommender systems, the utility function
usually considers one attribute of an item, e.g. its
overall evaluation or rating. Nevertheless, utility may also involve more than one attribute of an item. The
recommendation problem therefore becomes a multi-attribute one. We want to explore how recommendation of
scientific papers can be better defined if such a multi-attribute collaborative filtering approach is adopted.
To achieve this, we have taken into consideration the dataset that the Mendeley.com platform has published as
part of the RecSys 2012 challenge by Mendeley . We have treated this dataset as a multi-criteria rating one,
considering that the existence of a paper in a user library, the flag of whether a paper was read, and the
existence of a vote/star next to a paper can be three different dimensions upon which a user may express
his/her preferences over a publication, with a value range for each dimension 0 to 1. The Mendeley dataset
includes 50.000 user libraries that contain a total of 4.848.724 articles. In this dataset 615.308 of the 4.848.724
library entries has been starred by users. The general characteristics for the dataset are presented in Table 1.

The multi-criteria recommender system that we would like to test for the Mendeley case, is a multi-attribute
utility (MAUT) collaborative filtering system that was introduced by Manouselis & Costopoulou , and has
been experimentally tested in various occasions and contexts during the past few years (e.g. ). The
studied approach is a multi-attribute extension of related single-attribute algorithms. It considers each attribute
in separate, first trying to predict how the active user would evaluate item s upon each attribute, and then
synthesizing these attribute-based predictions into a total utility value. A variety of design options can be
considered for the studied algorithm, leading to several versions and parameterizations. A detailed explanation
of these options can be found in Manouselis & Costopoulou .
3. Layered evaluation for MAUT recommender systems
Layered evaluation (or decomposition) frameworks have attracted research attention in adaptive systems’
Nikos Manouselis and Katrien Verbert / Procedia Computer Science 18 1189 – 1197
research for more than a decade, with several frameworks, methods and instruments being proposed and tested
in relevant literature . They try to decompose a system in its constituent subsystems or layers and then
apply particular evaluation methods that can assess the performance of each targeted layer. The rationale
behind layered approaches is straightforward: most early attempts to evaluate such systems followed a “with-
and without-personalization” approach; that is, the “personalization component” was “separated” from the
system, and the two versions of the system (the one with personalization features and the one without) were
compared to investigate whether personalization brought significant benefits. This approach has a fundamental
problem: the “non-personalized” system used for evaluation is not an application which has been developed
according to certain design considerations, but rather a “bi-product” resulting when removing the
personalization component. Moreover, this approach is not useful when the personalized system is found to be
ineffective, since there is no way to understand why the system (or which specific component of the system)
was not successful so as to improve it.
Several layered evaluation frameworks have been proposed in the literature. The idea can be traced back to the
early 90s, when Totterdell & Boyle proposed that the accuracy of the user model and the effectiveness of
the changes made by the system should be evaluated separately. Ten years later, Karagiannidis & Sampson 
proposed the term “layered evaluation”, and suggested that layered evaluation should address the main
components of each system separately. Weibelzahl has proposed a similar layered framework, suggesting
the decomposition of personalization into the following three layers: (i) evaluation of input data, (ii) evaluation
of the inference mechanism, and (iii) evaluation of the personalization decisions. Paramythis et al. further
elaborated their decomposition by proposing five layers (or modules): (i) interaction monitoring, (ii)
interpretation and interface, (iii) modeling, (iv) personalization decision making, and (v) applying
personalizations.
An extensive survey of evaluation state-of-art and issues in recommender systems was carried out by Pu et al.
 . This survey identified a generic interaction model for such systems that includes three crucial components
that corresponded to groups of interaction activities between the user and the system: the initial preference
elicitation process, the preference refinement process, and the presentation of the system’s recommendation
results. This decomposition is very close to the way that layered evaluation frameworks are decomposing a
system in separate components that can be evaluated one by one. Pu et al. have suggested that layered
evaluation can be used in recommender systems’ research as a powerful technique in identifying areas of a
system that require further improvements. More specifically, the three interaction steps that the authors have
identified are described as such:
Elicit user preferences: the initial user preference profile can be established by users’ stated
preferences (explicit elicitation) or their objective behaviors (implicit elicitation).
Display recommendations: the system uses the above information to decide what to suggest to a user,
and is concerned with methods and strategies for effectively selecting and presenting results to its
Revise user preferences: users’ interaction with the system can lead to changes into the information
stored as preferences, thus resulting into a revision of the user preference profile.
To investigate how this layered framework could be applied to the MAUT recommender system evaluation, we
focus on these interaction steps and how they relate to the adaptation components/layers of a typical evaluation
framework (e.g. ):
All interactions related to the user preference profiles, i.e. the step of eliciting user preferences and the
step of revising user preferences, are corresponding to the “assessment of interaction” component,
since they deal with the way that the user model is being constructed and updated, and their evaluation
should take place in similar ways.
Nikos Manouselis and Katrien Verbert / Procedia Computer Science 18 1189 – 1197
All interactions related to the recommendation provision itself, i.e. the step of displaying
recommendations, is corresponding to the “adaptation decision making” component, since it deals
with the way that the recommendation is being created and presented, and its evaluation should take
place at this level.
According to this classification of interaction activities to such decomposition layers, it could be argued that a
layered approach would also apply for the evaluation of a recommender system as it follows:
Layer 1 - evaluation of user modeling: at this layer the user modeling process is being evaluated,
focusing mostly on whether the user characteristics are being successfully represented, recorded and
stored in the user model. This can include evaluation of the accuracy and completeness of the user
model (e.g. self-assessment by users) but also of the granularity of the user model. It can also include
experimentation with different modeling approaches, different model representation formats, as well
as the evaluation of techniques to boost performance such the use of stereotypes to create an initial
user model and avoid the cold-start problem.
Layer 2 – evaluation of adaptation decision making: at this layer the adaptation process, logic and
results are being evaluated, focusing mostly on whether the personalization actions are valid and
meaningful for the given state of the user model. This phase can be evaluated through user testing (e.g.
via usage scenarios) or by studying how the provided information leads to some desired result (e.g.
buying a particular product or viewing a particular item). It can also separate the evaluation of how the
recommendation is generated (testing different techniques or algorithms) from the evaluation of the
way recommendation is presented (testing alternative interface design options).
4. Setting up evaluation experiments adopting a layered approach
According to the analysis carried out in the previous section, the MAUT system designed on top of the
Mendeley dataset can be decomposed into:
All interactions related to the user preference profiles: in this system the user preferences are
represented as ratings over items and the representation method is a user-item matrix. The rating types
are numeric (measurable) and they are multi-criteria or multi-attribute ones, that is, ratings upon
multiple dimensions are being provided by the user in order to express preferences over an item.
All interactions related to the recommendations: in the system recommendations are provided in the
form of predicted ratings for unknown values, that is, a collaborative filtering algorithm is used to
predict how a user would rate an unknown item upon each dimension, according to how other people
with similar user models have rated it. This is a memory-based approach since it uses all history of
stored ratings for all users. It is also a personalized approach since the prediction is different for each
user, depending on his/her past ratings as well as the ratings of people that are found as similarminded.
In the next paragraphs we propose two possible evaluation experiments that could examine separately each
component and reveal useful insight on whether the MAUT approach may bring added value into such an
application context.
4.1. Evaluating the multi-criteria user model
The user model that we inferred from the Mendeley dataset is a typical one, since all collaborative filtering
systems are using (explicit or implicit) ratings to represent user preferences over items. In the MAUT system,
Nikos Manouselis and Katrien Verbert / Procedia Computer Science 18 1189 – 1197
the particularity is that a multi-dimensional approach is used, which is argued to bring more accurate preference
modeling and therefore better recommendation results.
To evaluate how this user modeling approach performs in the context of the MAUT system in comparison to a
single-attribute approach where only one overall rating is being provided for the item by the user, we can
compare how the number of dimensions (criteria) affected the performance of the system. In particular:
A large number of datasets may be created, by breaking down the very large Mendeley dataset into
many smaller ones or by producing a variety of synthetic (simulated) datasets, which will have various
properties, e.g. ranging from single-criterion to multi-criteria datasets and from very sparse to very
dense ones.
The algorithm of the MAUT collaborative filtering system can be then executed upon all these
datasets, and its performance can be measured using a variety of metrics (such as MAE and coverage).
The correlation can be then calculated between the properties of the dataset that relate to the user
model (and especially the number and scale of the rating dimensions) and the values of the measured
performance metrics. The aim is to explore whether using multiple dimensions seems to be connected
with better or worse performance results for the collaborative filtering algorithms.
Table 2 presents an example/dummy version of how such results could look like, in order to be able to
understand whether adding multiple dimensions to the user model may result into different performance

4.2. Evaluation of the collaborative filtering algorithm
The recommendation algorithms that have been used within the proposed MAUT Mendeley recommender are
Nikos Manouselis and Katrien Verbert / Procedia Computer Science 18 1189 – 1197
rather typical, and the only difference is that the user model is a multi-attribute one. Trying to disconnect the
evaluation of the user model from the evaluation of the recommendation method and algorithm, we would like
to carry out an evaluation experiment that will compare the MAUT collaborative filtering algorithms versus
some non-personalized basic algorithms. In this comparison, we would study how the collaborative filtering
algorithm performed over a number of smaller datasets that have been created by the original larger one, or
(even better) by studying their performance over additional datasets that come from paper recommendation
settings except from the Mendeley one. Table 3 presents an example/dummy version of how such results could
look like, comparing the performance of various algorithms and their variations over different datasets from
this application domain.
5. Discussion
The benefit of using such a layered evaluation approach is first identified in the way it may reveal whether the
choice of a data property value (such as the number of criteria or their rating scales) may affect the performance
of the algorithms and therefore be treated carefully during experimentation. It may also help justify whether
multi-criteria user modelling may improve the performance of recommender systems and in which ways, by
studying the way that performance measures are correlated with the multiple rating attributes.
Furthermore, an additional benefit of such an experimental testing approach is the fact that it illustrates the
importance of using multiple datasets (by creating small random samples of a bigger one, by generated
simulated/synthetic ones, or by using different datasets available in the same application domain). This is the
most widely used experiment type in recommender system research, but sometimes the importance of using
multiple but comparable datasets is underestimated. The layered approach has indicated how important this
perspective is when trying to assess the difference that a particular algorithm (or variation of an algorithm)
makes for a given context.
Nevertheless, layered frameworks would benefit recommendation systems’ research if they can further provide
them with:
Coherent and systematic evaluation methods ready for application in testing.
Recommender system decompositions that can apply to more systems and algorithms.
Ways in which evaluation hints may be translated into concrete and measurable indicators for the
system implementor/operator.
More detailed evaluation guidelines and recommendations, such as suggested methods, tools and
instruments that would fit each component.
6. Conclusions
This paper introduces the case of a multi-criteria recommender system for the Mendeley platform using an
existing dataset that Mendeley has published, which may be considered to be a multi-attribute one. It then
studies how evaluation of this approach can take place by adopting a layered evaluation framework. The paper
assesses the applicability of layered evaluation for such systems and examines the types of experiments that
may be carried out to assess the various components of multi-criteria recommender systems. Our analysis
indicates that implementing a layered-based recommender system evaluation has the potential to facilitate a
more detailed and informed evaluation of such systems, allowing researchers and developers to better
understand how they may improve them.
