Students perceive online courses differently than traditional courses. Negative
perceptions can lead to unfavourable learning outcomes including decreased
motivation and persistence. Throughout this review, a broad range of factors that
affect performance and satisfaction within the online learning environment for
adult learners will be examined including learning outcomes, instructional design
and learner characteristics, followed by suggestions for further research, and
concluding with implications for online learning pertinent to administrators,
instructors, course designers and students. Online learning may not be appropriate
for every student. Identifying particular characteristics that contribute to online
success versus failure may aid in predicting possible learning outcomes and save
students from enrolling in online courses if this type of learning environment is
not appropriate for them. Furthermore, knowing these learner attributes may assist
faculty in designing quality online courses to meet students’ needs. Adequate
instructional methods, support, course structure and design can facilitate student
performance and satisfaction.

Advances in technology, including the internet, have affected the delivery of education
across the world. Online learning is growing at an incredible rate. The Sloan
Foundation annual report, Going the Distance: Online Education in the United States
2011, reported that over 6.5 million students enrolled in at least one online course
during 2010 with 31% of post-secondary students taking at least one online course
 . While there has been an increase in this method of delivery, it
is still relatively new. The present review will examine a broad range of factors that
affect performance and satisfaction within the online learning environment for adult
learners. Much research has been done examining traditional models of delivery (i.e.
classroom); extensive information regarding the online classroom is still emerging.
According to Moore and Kearsley , online learning has typically been the chosen
method for working adults aged 2550. Online education offers a convenience and
flexibility that traditional face-to-face classes cannot, especially important for those
learners balancing work, school and family. Almost all courses nowadays have some
online component, often using web-based technology to facilitate delivery of course

documents including syllabi and assignments . In this review,
I adopt a typically-used definition of online learning as courses in which all of the
instruction/materials are presented online; blended/hybrid courses incorporate face-toface meetings with online delivery in which 3080% of course material is delivered
online . Online courses differ from traditional courses in
many ways. Face-to-face instruction allows the instructor to judge students’ level of
understanding of material from non-verbal behaviour and permits modifications to be
made to instruction. Questions can be answered immediately to provide clarifications
and prevent misunderstandings. The nature of online instruction does not allow
instructors to perceive important non-verbal cues that signal understanding; the sole
method of communication is primarily writing .
The quintessential academically successful online student can be described as selfmotivated, self-directed, exhibiting an internal locus of control with above average
executive functioning, communication, interaction and technological skills . However, not every student exhibits all of these characteristics. Students may
vary on learning styles, cognitive styles, self-efficacy, persistence, self-regulation, affective skills etc. In addition, some adult learners may be more comfortable with
traditional, instructor-directed, passive methods of learning. There is controversy with
regards to the optimum learning styles for success in online learning. External variables
such as adequate course/instructional design become of great importance, and faculty
should take these characteristics into account in course design .
There is a push for empirical studies based on direct systematic observation,
documenting the effectiveness ofonline learning. The Sloane Consortium’s 2011 report
about online education showed that 51% of academic officers (i.e. deans/provosts)
believe that online instruction is comparable to face-to-face instruction while 14%
believe that it is somewhat superior. Furthermore, 63% believed that perceived student
satisfaction was the same for online and face-to-face courses .
Demonstration of learning outcomes as well as additional insights into student
characteristics and course/instructional design strategies that contribute to effective
online learning still need to be investigated .
Several key questions come to mind: What makes online courses successful in
terms of student outcomes and satisfaction? Are there particular student characteristics that contribute to positive learning outcomes? What aspects of online course/
instructional design contribute to academic achievement and which represent barriers
that impact success ? Clearly, attrition rates still remain high for online
courses as compared to traditional learning environments, with figures anywhere from
10% to approximately 50% higher . Students perceive online courses differently than traditional
courses. Negative perceptions, especially inaccurate ones, can lead to unfavourable
learning outcomes including decreased motivation and persistence . Online learning can lead to negative emotions including frustration
 , especially if courses are poorly designed and or
students do not exhibit the skills needed to learn online. Online learning may not be
appropriate for every student. Identifying particular characteristics of students that
contribute to online success versus failure may aid in predicting possible learning
outcomes and save students from enrolling in online courses if this type of learning
environment is not appropriate for them. Furthermore, knowing these learner attributes may assist faculty in designing quality online courses to meet students’ needs.

Adequate instructional methods, support, course structure and design can facilitate
student performance and satisfaction .
I begin this review by examining comparative studies of learning outcomes to
demonstrate the effectiveness of online learning as compared to traditional learning.
I follow this with syntheses of studies that examine course/instructional design
practices and conditions associated with student performance and satisfaction in
online learning contexts. Finally, I discuss specific research studies that examine
student attributes crucial for academic success. I conclude with an analysis of the body
of research as a whole, focusing on what is known regarding student and design
characteristics that contribute to learner success and satisfaction, what is not yet
known (i.e. limitations of results from the available research) and suggestions
for further research/implications for online learning pertinent to administrators,
instructors, course designers and students.
Learning outcomes: online versus classroom learning
The most recent research has focused on whether online learning is as effective as
learning in traditional classroom environments. Several studies have found online
learning to be comparable to face-to-face learning. Cao and Sakchutchawan 
sought to investigate if online and traditional MBA courses were similar in terms of
quality and student satisfaction. Results did not reveal significant differences between
course passing rates for online versus traditional students, but did reveal significant
differences in course satisfaction with lower mean ratings for online courses. The
authors concluded that students enrolled in online MBA courses performed as well as
students enrolled in traditional MBA courses; however, online MBA students were less
satisfied with their learning experiences. In contrast, Ashby, Sadera and McNary
 examined performance outcomes across three different contexts (i.e. face-toface, blended and online) for students enrolled in an intermediate developmental
community college math course. They found that students enrolled in the traditional
class scored worse than those students in online and blended courses on course tests
and earned lower course averages. In addition, more passing grades were earned by the
students in the online course followed by blended and then traditional environments
suggesting online learning to be more effective than classroom based learning.
However, differences in the learning environments themselves (in the online setting
students were permitted to take course tests with notes by their side) may explain why
the online students received the highest course averages and passing grades over the
traditional students; it does not mean, however, that the online students learned more
than the traditional students.
A meta-analysis conducted by the US Department of Education on 45 controlled
design category 1 (entirely online versus classroom) and 2 (blended versus classroom)
studies published between 1996 and 2008 revealed modestly large mean effect sizes
for learning outcomes (e.g. grades, scores on midterm/final exams, etc.) for students
in online learning (d0.20) versus traditional face-to-face classes . Effect sizes were larger for blended (d0.35) versus
fully online courses (d0.05). Aragon, Johnson and Shaik sought to
determine if students enrolled in graduate level online versus in-person courses
(Human Resources classes) differed on learning style preferences and if these learning
style preferences affected success in online versus in-person learning contexts.
Learning style was comprised of motivation, task engagement, and cognitive control

systems based on Curry’s theoretical framework and evaluated outcomes
using the Student Learning Style Scale, Learning and Study Strategies Inventory,
Learning Style Inventory and final course/project grades. Results indicated that the
groups differed in cognitive controls with online students exhibiting greater reflective
observations and preferring abstract conceptualisation (i.e. learning by thinking),
whereas traditional students reported increased use of active experimentation (i.e.
learning by doing). However, results indicated that differences in learning style
preferences did not affect learning success for the two groups. The authors concluded
that online learning can be as effective as traditional classroom learning even if
learning style preferences vary.
Course design characteristics of online learning environments
Several studies have investigated course and instructional design factors that
contribute to effective online learning, both in terms of outcomes and satisfaction.
Ruey used a qualitative approach (structured interviews, content analysis of
course documents, surveys and online observations) to explore the use of a
constructivist-based design for a professional development graduate level online
course to investigate how and if online students benefit from this model. Several
aspects, including peer moderated discussions, group projects and chat room meetings,
used constructivist-based instructional strategies. Results suggested that this model
facilitated development of self-directed learning skills and a sense of community
among the learners via peer collaboration. It changed some of the learners’ views
regarding online learning and learning in general (i.e. students reported being more
concerned with what was learned rather than just grades and related what they learned
to daily life); however, adequate facilitation and critical feedback on the part of the
instructor were reported as critical factors in perceived quality of the online course.
Song, Singleton, Hill and Koh examined factors related to online learning
effectiveness from the graduate students’ perspective. Learners’ perceptions were
assessed using a survey generated by the researchers targeting learner characteristics,
perceived difficulties and beneficial components of online learning. Results indicated
that course design and time management were crucial components to successful online
learning, while lack of community and technical problems were most challenging for
online learners. Eom, Wen and Ashill also sought to examine factors that
contribute to perceived student success and satisfaction in university online learning
contexts, examining both learner and course design characteristics. Self-motivation,
learning styles, instructor knowledge/facilitation, instructor feedback, interaction, and
course structure were assessed using a researcher-generated survey. Results showed
that the model (comprised of the six variables listed above) explained 69% of the
variance in learner satisfaction and 63% of the variance in learning outcomes. Further
analysis revealed that, for learner satisfaction, all of the factors included in the model
were significant; only instructor feedback and learning style were significant for
learning outcomes. The authors concluded that online learning is best suited for
students with visual and readwrite learning styles and that instructor feedback
should be integrated into the course design.
Ke and Xie also examined the perception of learning success and satisfaction
among undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in online courses, but examined
the effect that course design has on these variables. Ten courses analysed in the study
were coded into one of three course design models:
H. Kauffman
(page number not for citation purpose)
Citation: Research in Learning Technology 2015, 23: 26507 - 
(1) integrated  content was unstructured and adaptable; no textbook-weekly
readings provided by instructor; online discussions/team projects with active
facilitation by instructor,
(2) content-support  highly structured with pre-recorded lectures and assignments/quizzes; minimal interaction with other students, or
(3) wrap around  moderately structured with weekly virtual lectures and
assignments; 550% of time dedicated to participation in the discussion board;
moderately structured assigned online discussion tasks (integrated [combination of open- and close-ended], open-ended or close-ended).
Results showed that learners were significantly more satisfied with the integrated than
the wrap around course model, and were significantly less satisfied with close-ended
(versus integrated) discussion types. The authors concluded that the integrated course
design model appears to promote the highest level of satisfaction while close-ended
discussion tasks promote the opposite. The United States Department of Education
meta-analysis also revealed specific instructional/design practices and conditions associated with improved performance. A narrative synthesis of
category 3 studies (online courses with interactive elements, such as videos) suggested
that learner control of interactions and prompts facilitating reflecting on information, including problem solving strategies/self-explanation, were found to be
successful for online learning performance.
Course content/discipline
In the online learning environment, just as in the traditional courses, consideration
of alignment of instructional content and assessment measureswith learning outcomes
is critical to successful learning outcomes and satisfaction. In other words, course
objectives should align with the delivery of content and the manner in which learning is assessed . Blumberg offers suggestions for instructors
with regards to course alignment and maximising learning, including creating
objectives based on taxonomies of learning [i.e. Anderson and Krathwohl 
revised taxonomy], matching the teaching, learning and assessment activities with the
objectives. Objectives are the main driving force of a course; they detail what students
should master by the end of a course; assessments are used to determine if students
have met the course objectives. Given the importance of objectives, they should guide
course planning and approach to teaching of information.
Anderson and Krathwohl revised taxonomy details levels and types of
learning. Levels of learning include remember, understand, apply, analyse, evaluate
and create. Types of learning include factual, conceptual, procedural and metacognitive. Conceptual knowledge promotes deeper learning (i.e. application, analysis
and evaluation) versus factual knowledge, something instructors should consider when
planning and designing a course. Courses become misaligned when objectives do not
match teaching, learning and/or assessment methods. For example, objectives may state
higher level cognitive processes (e.g. analysis and evaluation); however, instructors may
not provide teaching or learning opportunities that facilitate that type of knowledge
(e.g. just providing PowerPoint lectures of factual information). According to Reeves
 , assessment methods are the most misaligned component of courses, regardless
of the context. He suggests that instructors tend to focus on assessing things that
are easy to measure (i.e. factual information via multiple choice tests), rather than
Research in Learning Technology
Citation: Research in Learning Technology 2015, 23: 26507 - 
(page number not for citation purpose)
assessing authentic tasks (i.e. problem-based assessments). Course management
systems (CMS) used in online courses (e.g. Blackboard) make it easy for instructors
to lose sight of alignment, given the automaticity of using templates and drop down
tools. Often, instructors are ill informed of ways to effectively use the features present in
CMS . Instructors can learn ways to use technology to
create instructorlearner, learnerlearner and learnercontent interactions to promote
deeper levels of knowledge .
Different disciplines may require different types of knowledge, especially in terms of
conceptual and procedural knowledge . The online learning environment presents a unique challenge on how to engage students in developing discipline
specific conceptual procedural knowledge. McCracken, Cho, Sharif, Wilson,
and Miller provided case study examples of ways to engage and develop deeper
levels of knowledge in an online dental hygiene undergraduate programme. The design
strategy included peer assessment, virtual patients (for assessment and treatment
planning), and extended case studies, incorporating problem-based and authentic
learning experiences in both instruction/learning activities and assessment. Jones
 provided examples of integrating technology with course content in clinical
social work online courses to meet discipline specific objectives. Students studying to
become social workers need to develop higher level skill sets including interpersonal
skills, self-awareness, application, analysis and evaluation skills (for diagnostic
assessment, planning and treatment). Jones used synchronous videoconferencing, service learning (for developing clinical skills) and role playing (with asynchronous video recordings) in the online foundational social work courses. Students in both
the online and face-to-face courses rated them favourably. Rogerson-Revell used
e-tivities in an online applied linguistics/TESOL masters programme to build critical
thinking and practice skills. The e-tivities were designed to promote collaboration and
formative assessment (portfolio of written assignments and activities) in an asynchronous manner with use of an e-moderator (student tutor). E-tivitieswere module specific
with no more than 810 students in each cohort, and used voice based discussion
boards, podcasts and blogs. Students reported increased motivation, reflection and
preparedness for their final module assessment.
Learner characteristics and learning outcomes
Several research studies have also sought to examine learner characteristics which
contribute to positive performance outcomes. Berenson, Boyles and Weaver 
investigated the relationship between learners’ emotional intelligence (EI), resilience,
personality type and success [via surveys/grade point average (GPA)] in the context of
online learning for a diverse population of technical community college students.
EI was defined as the awareness and self-regulation of feelings and needs, measured by
the EI-Q abridged survey. EI accounted for 11% of the variance in GPA and the
combination of EI and personality accounted for 18% of the variance. Students with
lower amounts of success in online learning were characterised by having lower EI with
personalities marked by aggression, tension and external locus of control. In contrast,
DeTure investigated whether spatial skill (in terms of field independence/
dependence) and self-efficacy for use of computer technologies could predict success
(final course GPA) in online courses for community college students. The participants
were assessed on two measures: the GEFT (Group Embedded Figures Test: to
determine field independence/dependence) and the OTSES (Online Technologies
H. Kauffman
(page number not for citation purpose)
Citation: Research in Learning Technology 2015, 23: 26507 - 
Self-efficacy Scale). Results indicated that neither the GEFT nor the OTSES
significantly predicted success in online courses. There was, however, a significant
positive relationship between GEFT and OTSES, suggesting that those with higher
field independence demonstrated greater self-efficacy with online technologies. This
can be explained by the fact that spatial measures can tap general intelligence: if general
intelligence is the product of prior academic success this would explain why spatial
skills and self-efficacy are correlated. DeTure concluded that students with greater field
independence and hence greater computer technology self-efficacy would not
necessarily receive higher grades in online courses than those students with more field
dependence and less computer self-efficacy. Similarly to DeTure’s findings, Liu,
Magjuka and Lee found that cognitive style did not affect online learning
performance. Muilenburg and Berge examined perceived barriers to learning
online for adult learners engaged in avariety of web-based learning settings (university
courses, community college courses, business/corporate courses) using a self-report
survey. Exploratory factor analysis revealed time management and lack of motivation
as significant underlying barriers. Less important barriers included technical skills,
which support DeTure’s findings regarding technology self-efficacy and online learning
outcomes. Results ofother studies have similarly demonstrated the important roles that
self-regulation (including time management skills, active learning style and selfdiscipline) and motivation play in online learning .
Conclusions
The main findings from the literature supported learner characteristics and skills
needed to be successful and satisfied with online learning. What emerged following
this narrative synthesis was a profile of the successful online student: one who
demonstrates greater EI, that is, self-awareness of needs, adequate management of
feelings , self-regulation skills, self-discipline, time
management, organisation, planning, self-evaluating , reflective/visual learning styles
 and internal locus of control
 .These findings
are not surprising considering the nature of online learning. More responsibility is
placed on the learner, especially in asynchronous courses. The student is responsible
for reviewing course material, taking exams at scheduled intervals etc., which requires
adequate self-regulation skills. Self-regulated students take control of their learning,
developing appropriate metacognitive strategies such as planning, staying organised
and motivated .
EI also plays a role in online learning; it is easy for students to get frustratedwith the
technology and/or challenges to understanding information without the option of
immediate feedback and/or assistance. Students who are able to control their emotions
and get proper assistance prior to becoming frustrated will have better control over
their learning . Learning style characteristics such
as being a visual learner make sense in the online learning context. Information is
typically presented visually versus aurally with learners coming to understand
information via descriptions. Online learning may not be the best context for students
who are not visual learners .
Research in Learning Technology

(page number not for citation purpose)
Some surprising results surfaced regarding success in online learning. While
preferred learning styles may vary between students in online and traditional classes,
with online students preferring reflective learning and traditional students preferring
active learning (i.e. learning by doing), these preferences for learning did not affect
success: students can perform just as well online as in face-to-face courses regardless
of learning style. This demonstrates that some students have flexibility and can adapt
to the different learning environments being successful in both contexts . Another surprise finding concerns cognitive style and
technology self-efficacy. Students with field independent cognitive styles are independent learners, using internal cues to understand information and demonstrate greater
confidence in using online technology; field dependent students depend on others
to learn information, and may not be as comfortable with online technology; however,
these differences did not translate to differences in success within online learning
 . Other studies have demonstrated
mixed results regarding comfort with online technology and success in online learning,
that is, no difference in learning outcomes for those students with high versus low
technology efficacy . Perhaps students enter the world of online learning equipped with
requisite skills for using the technology, and because of the high level of self-regulation
skills they possess, they become self-motivated to learn how to navigate through the
In terms of satisfaction, learners were pleased with online courses that were
structured , interactive, that is, constructivist
instructional design , relevant, that is, application based with practical
significance , and instructor facilitated in terms of
interactions/feedback . Courses that facilitated increased performance and
satisfaction were interactive and allowed for collaboration, organised/structured
with prompts to facilitate reflection as learning is occurring. All of these factors
involved in satisfaction come down to instructional and course design. Courses should
be structured around reading materials, lectures and assignments organised into units
with clear learning goals in mind. In other words, course instructors need to ensure that
there is alignment of objectives with instructional methods, learning activities and
assessment methods . Instructors should provide timely feedback
and serve as facilitators of discussion and interaction just as they do in traditional
courses. Courses should provide opportunities for peer collaboration and sharing
of ideas in order to develop an online community of learners, rather than feelings
of isolation .
Implications
Yukselturk and Bulut offered some recommendations regarding design of
online courses to meet learner expectations, including integrating strategies to
facilitate self-regulation within the course, monitoring of students performance with
prompt feedback, regular interactions with peers and instructors while making use of
current technology, and ensuring content of practical significance so as to allow
students to make real life connections. Self-regulation strategies can be facilitated

through the use of learner reflection prompts, providing learners a way to explicitly
reflect on what they are learning . Dabbagh suggested two
learning models to accommodate and support the characteristics of successful online
learners: exploratory and dialogical models. The exploratory model is based on
inquiry/authentic problem-based learning methods which support the attributes of
successful online learners (i.e. reflective and self-directed/self-regulated learning). This
model can be implemented through use of internet resources including hypermedia/
multimedia links and specific instructional modules to facilitate exploration.
Dialogical models of learning focus on learning information through interactions:
i.e. conversations supported through group forums/discussion boards, listservs, chat
groups and document sharing, emphasising collaboration and reflection. Ruey 
proposed a constructivist-based model for online learning in which the instructor
functions as the facilitator/mentor, assisting in the development of reflective/critical
thinking skills; the TA (teaching assistant) functions in a supporting/monitoring role;
and the students function in a moderating role, keeping one another engaged in
interactive learning.
Limitations of prior studies
The aforementioned studies did not account for instructor attributes and the role these
characteristics play in online satisfaction and otheroutcomes. In addition, these studies
did not separately analyse the learning or needs of students with disabilities or those
from various socioeconomic backgrounds. The importance of instructor feedback
emerged from the narrative synthesis; however, the importance of peer feedback has
not been systematically investigated. It is still not known what role peer feedback plays
in knowledge building within online classrooms. While we know the importance of
instructor feedback on learners’ satisfaction and performance, we do not know how
timing affects this, i.e. if there is a limit to when feedback is effective, considering the
time delay that is ubiquitous in online learning. The above studies failed to investigate
how the quality of instructor feedback affects satisfaction and learning outcomes.
Finally, many of the studies used surveys/self-report measures to assess learner
characteristics and satisfaction. Many of these surveys were not adequately validated,
which in effect, casts doubt on the findings.
What is also not yet known is if students in online learning courses/programmes
learn course material deeply versus superficially. Many of the studies included in this
synthesis used course GPA as indicators of success, which in of itself does indicate deep
knowledge and necessarilygreateroutcomes. Manyof the course design suggestions for
developing quality online classes provide opportunities for deep learning experiences;
however, many of the studies did not investigate whether deep learning occurred. Ke
and Xie found that the majority of students included in their study reported a
deep learning approach on questionnaires, but the content analysis of the online
discussions suggested otherwise. We do not fully understand how reading and writing
vary for online versus traditional learning modes and how this affects online
performance. The former studies did not account for students’ level of technological
literacy (literacy for computer/information technology) and how this affects learning.
It is also not known how various suggested pedagogical models for online learning
compare in terms of learner satisfaction and knowledge building.

Future research and practice
In the future, researchers can create valid and reliable instruments to empirically assess
student attributes specific to online learning to determine if students are ready to take
online courses. One such measure, the Test of Online Learning Success (TOOLS), has
been created and validated for just this purpose. The
test taps five constructs: computer skills, independent learning, need for online
learning, dependent learning and academic skills, assessing strengths and weaknesses
with regards to online learning readiness. Across the 3 years of development and
validation of the TOOLS, the researchers’ identified critical student characteristics for
predicting online success were all related to independent learning (self-regulation skills,
time management, multitasking, self-motivation/discipline). Reading and writing
proficiency was also crucial to student performance. Following administration of
such a measure, administrators could create orientation courses to explicitly teach
strategies that have been demonstrated to be helpful in online learning including selfregulation skills, and instruct students on the differences between traditional and webbased courses, including the more autonomous nature of learning in online courses.
Professors/instructors should be knowledgeable regarding design characteristics
that promote student success and satisfaction including course alignment and
integration of content with technology to facilitate engagement. Institutions should
provide faculty with instructional courses regarding making the transition to teaching
online courses including the aforementioned design characteristics. Universities should
not just assume that faculty can teach effectively online. Instructors may need explicit
guidance regarding the importance of such factors as prompt feedback, a primary
factor for online satisfaction. This makes sense considering that feedback can motivate
students . According to the Sloan Consortium report on
online learning, only 6% of universities surveyed did not provide training and or
mentoring programmes of faculty teaching online courses .
Another consideration that institutions should take into account is course size. The
nature of online courses makes it easy to enrol more students per course than
traditional courses. Large enrolment courses may be challenging for instructors to
effectively provide enough attention/ interaction to individual students and manage the
course; students may find it challenging to manage discussion boards and interaction
with fellow classmates. Studies have demonstrated the negative impact of large course
size on online course satisfaction measures . More research is needed examining the effect of course size on student
performance and satisfaction within the online learning environment, including the
‘optimal’ course size and effects on satisfaction and learning outcomes of placing
students enrolled in larger online courses into cohorts.
Another area that warrants further investigation involves the use of technology
within online courses to meet the needs of students with disabilities.
In conclusion, many studies have documented that online courses can be just as or
more successful than traditional face-to-face courses . Success in online learning requires
interaction between the learner, instructor, learners and technology .
Fully online degree programmes are emerging at a fast rate due to the increased
demand . More and more students are turning to online
learning as it represents convenience in a busy and demanding society. Technology is

also changing at a rapid rate; new ways of obtaining and sharing information are being
developed and applied to the higher education setting. With all of these changes, it
becomes even more important for colleges and universities to find ways to improve
the quality of online learning to maximise learning, including effectively aligning
technology with course content and instruction . Ultimately,
future employers will expect that students with a degree, no matter if completed online
or in person, will have obtained the necessary skills and knowledge to perform the job
requirements. In addition, students with no other choice but to complete degrees online
will expect to receive the same standard of education as students in traditional degree
programmes; decreased satisfaction with internal factors including instructional
design, course organisation, online teaching skills and use of technology, are predictors
of attrition, which can lead to loss of money and time/investment for both students
and universities/colleges . This review has demonstrated
that many factors play a role in satisfaction with and success in online learning. The
challenge remains for institutions to design courses to meet students’ needs/expectations, for instructors to effectively integrate technology into content, including features
of CMS, in order to facilitate engagement and deeper learning, and for students to be
self-disciplined and use technology to engage with other students and the instructor.
