A map of human genome variation from
population-scale sequencing
The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium*
The 1000 Genomes Project aims to provide a deep characterization of human genome sequence variation as a foundation
for investigating the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Here we present results of the pilot phase of the
project, designed to develop and compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput
platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four
populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother–father–child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697
individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of
approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000
structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast
majority of common variation, over 95% of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this
data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated
genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used
to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base
substitution mutations to be approximately 1028 per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to
signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes,
due to selection at linked sites. These methods and public data will support the next phase of human genetic research.
Understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype is
one of the central goals in biology and medicine. The reference human
genome sequence1 provides a foundation for the study of human
genetics, but systematic investigation of human variation requires full
knowledge of DNA sequence variation across the entire spectrum of
allele frequencies and types of DNA differences. Substantial progress
has already been made. By 2008 the public catalogue of variant sites
(dbSNP 129) contained approximately 11 million single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and 3 million short insertions and deletions
(indels)2–4. Databases of structural variants (for example, dbVAR)
indexed the locations of large genomic variants. The International
HapMap Project catalogued both allele frequencies and the correlation
patterns between nearby variants, a phenomenon known as linkage
disequilibrium (LD), across several populations for 3.5 million SNPs3,4.
These resources have driven disease gene discovery in the first
generation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), wherein
genotypes at several hundred thousand variant sites, combined with
the knowledge of LD structure, allow the vast majority of common
variants (here, those with .5% minor allele frequency (MAF)) to be
tested for association4 with disease. Over the past 5 years association
studies have identified more than a thousand genomic regions associated with disease susceptibility and other common traits5. Genomewide collections of both common and rare structural variants have
similarly been tested for association with disease6.
Despite these successes, much work is still needed to achieve a deep
understanding of the genetic contribution to human phenotypes7.
Once a region has been identified as harbouring a risk locus, detailed
studyofallgeneticvariantsinthelocusisrequiredtodiscoverthecausal
variant(s),toquantifytheircontributiontodiseasesusceptibility,andto
elucidate their roles in functional pathways. Low-frequency and rare
variants (here defined as 0.5% to 5% MAF, and below 0.5% MAF,
respectively) vastly outnumber common variants and also contribute
significantlytothegeneticarchitectureofdisease,but ithasnotyetbeen
possible to study them systematically7–9. Meanwhile, advances in DNA
sequencing technology have enabled the sequencing of individual
genomes10–13, illuminating the gaps in the first generation of databases
that contain mostly common variant sites. A much more complete
catalogue of human DNA variation is a prerequisite to understand fully
the role of common and low-frequency variants in human phenotypic
variation.
The aim of the 1000 Genomes Project is to discover, genotype and
provide accurate haplotype information on all forms of human DNA
polymorphism in multiple human populations. Specifically, the goal
is to characterize over 95% of variants that are in genomic regions
accessible to current high-throughput sequencing technologies and
that have allele frequency of 1% or higher (the classical definition of
polymorphism) in each of five major population groups (populations
in or with ancestry from Europe, East Asia, South Asia, West Africa
and the Americas). Because functional alleles are often found in coding
regions and have reduced allele frequencies, lower frequency alleles
(down towards 0.1%) will also be catalogued in such regions.
Here we report the results of the pilot phase of the project, the aim of
which was to develop and compare differentstrategies for genome-wide
sequencing with high-throughput platforms. To this end we undertook
three projects: low-coverage sequencing of 179 individuals; deep
sequencing of six individuals in two trios; and exon sequencing of
8,140 exons in 697 individuals (Box 1). The results give us a much
deeper, more uniform picture of human genetic variation than was
previously available, providing newinsights into thelandscapes of functional variation, genetic association and natural selection in humans.
Data generation, alignment and variant discovery
A total of 4.9 terabases of DNA sequence was generated in nine
sequencing centres using three sequencing technologies, from DNA

obtained from immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (Table 1 and
Supplementary Table 1). All sequenced individuals provided informed
consent and explicitly agreed to public dissemination of their variation
data, as part of the HapMap Project (see Supplementary Information
for details of informed consent and data release). The heterogeneity of
the sequence data (read lengths from 25 to several hundred base pairs
(bp); single and paired end) reflects the diversity and rapid evolution of
the underlying technologies during the project. All primary sequence
data were confirmed to have come from the correct individual by
comparison to HapMap SNP genotype data.
Analysis to detect and genotype sequence variants differed among
variant types and the three projects, but all workflows shared the
following four features. (1) Discovery: alignment of sequence reads
to the reference genome and identification of candidate sites or
regions at which one or more samples differ from the reference
sequence; (2) filtering: use of quality control measures to remove
candidate sites that were probably false positives; (3) genotyping:
estimation of the alleles present in each individual at variant sites or
regions; (4) validation: assaying a subset of newly discovered variants
using an independent technology, enabling the estimation of the false
discovery rate (FDR). Independent data sources were used to estimate
the accuracy of inferred genotypes.
All primary sequence reads, mapped reads, variant calls, inferred
genotypes, estimated haplotypes and new independent validation
data are publicly available through the project website ( 
1000genomes.org); filtered sets of variants, allele frequencies and genotypes were also deposited in dbSNP ( 
Alignment and the ‘accessible genome’
Sequencing reads were aligned to the NCBI36 reference genome
(details in Supplementary Information) and made available in the
BAM file format14, an early innovation of the project for storing
and sharing high-throughput sequencing data. Accurate identification of genetic variation depends on alignment of the sequence data to
the correct genomic location. We restricted most variant calling to the
‘accessible genome’, defined as that portion of the reference sequence
that remains after excluding regions with many ambiguously placed
reads or unexpectedly high or low numbers of aligned reads (Supplementary Information). This approach balances the need to reduce
incorrect alignments and false-positive detection of variants against
maximizing the proportion of the genome that can be interrogated.
For the low-coverage analysis, the accessible genome contains
approximately 85% of the reference sequence and 93% of the coding
sequences. Over 99% of sites genotyped in the second generation
haplotype map (HapMap II)4 are included. Of inaccessible sites, over
97% are annotated as high-copy repeats or segmental duplications.
However, only one-quarter of previously discovered repeats and segmental duplications were inaccessible (Supplementary Table 2). Much
of the data for the trio project were collected before technical improvements in our ability to map sequence reads robustly to some of the
repeated regions of the genome (primarily longer, paired reads). For
these reasons, stringent alignment was more difficult and a smaller
portion of the genome was accessible in the trio project: 80% of the
reference,85%ofcodingsequenceand97%ofHapMapIIsites(Table1).
Calibration, local realignment and assembly
The quality of variant calls is influenced by many factors including the
quantification of base-calling error rates in sequence reads, the accuracy of local read alignment and the method by which individual
genotypes are defined. The project introduced key innovations in each
of these areas (see Supplementary Information). First, base quality
scores reported by the image processing software were empirically
recalibrated by tallying the proportion that mismatched the reference
sequence (at non-dbSNP sites) as a function of the reported quality
score, position in read and other characteristics. Second, at potential
variant sites, local realignmentof all reads was performed jointly across
all samples, allowing for alternative alleles that contained indels. This
realignment step substantially reduced errors, because local misalignment, particularly around indels, can be a major source of error in
The 1000 Genomes pilot projects
To develop and assess multiple strategies to detect and genotype
variants of various types and frequencies using high-throughput
sequencing, we carried out three projects, using samples from the
extended HapMap collection17.
Trio project: whole-genome shotgun sequencing at high coverage
(average 423) of two families (one Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI);
one of European ancestry in Utah (CEU)), each including two parents
and one daughter. Each of the offspring was sequenced using three
platforms and by multiple centres.
Low-coverage project: whole-genome shotgun sequencing at low
coverage (2–63) of 59 unrelated individuals from YRI, 60 unrelated
individuals from CEU, 30 unrelated Han Chinese individuals in Beijing
(CHB) and 30 unrelated Japanese individuals in Tokyo (JPT).
Exon project: targeted capture of 8,140 exons from 906 randomly
selected genes (total of 1.4Mb) followed by sequencing at high
coverage (average .503) in 697 individuals from 7 populations of
African (YRI, Luhya in Webuye, Kenya (LWK)), European (CEU, Toscani
in Italia (TSI)) and East Asian (CHB, JPT, Chinese in Denver, Colorado
(CHD)) ancestry.
The three experimental designs differ substantially both in their
abilityto obtain data for variants ofdifferenttypes and frequencies and
in the analytical methods we used to infer individual genotypes. Box 1
Figure shows a schematic representation of the projects and the type
of information obtained from each. Colours in the left region indicate
different haplotypes in individual genomes, and line width indicates

example of genotype data that could be generated for the same
sample under the three strategies (dots indicate missing data; dashes
indicate phase information, that is, whether heterozygous variants can
be assigned to the correct haplotype). Within a short region of the
genome, each individual carries two haplotypes, typically shared by
others in the population. In the trio design, high-sequence coverage
and the use of multiple platforms enable accurate discovery of
multiple variant types across most of the genome, with Mendelian
transmission aiding genotype estimation, inference of haplotypes and
quality control. The low-coverage project, in contrast, efficiently
identifiesshared variantsoncommonhaplotypes49,50(redorblue),but
has lower power to detect rare haplotypes (light green) and associated
variants (indicated by the missing alleles), and will give some
inaccurate genotypes (indicated by the red allele incorrectly assigned
G). The exon design enables accurate discovery of common, rare and
low-frequency variation in the targeted portion of the genome, but
lacks the ability to observe variants outside the targeted regions or
assign haplotype phase.

variant calling. Finally, by initially analysing the data with multiple
genotype and variant calling algorithms and then generating a consensus of these results, the project reduced genotyping error rates by
30–50% compared to those currently achievable using any one of the
methods alone (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 12).
We also used local realignment to generate candidate alternative
haplotypes in the process of calling short (1–50-bp) indels15, as well as
local de novo assembly to resolve breakpoints for deletions greater
than 50 bp. The latter resulted in a doubling of the number of large
(.1 kb) structural variants delineated with base-pair resolution16. Full
genome de novo assembly was also performed (Supplementary
Information), resulting in the identification of 3.7 megabases (Mb)
of novel sequence not matching the reference at a high threshold for
assembly quality and novelty. All novel sequence matched other
human and great ape sequences in the public databases.
Rates of variant discovery
In the trio project, with an average mapped sequence coverage of 423
per individual acrosssix individualsand 2.3 gigabases (Gb)ofaccessible
genome, we identified 5.9 million SNPs, 650,000 short indels (of
1–50 bp in length), and over 14,000 larger structural variants. In the
low-coverage project, with average mapped coverage of 3.63 per individual across 179 individuals (Supplementary Fig. 2) and 2.4 Gb of
accessible genome, we identified 14.4 million SNPs, 1.3 million short
indels and over 20,000 larger structural variants. In the exon project,
with an average mapped sequence coverage of 563 per individual
across 697 individuals and a target of 1.4 Mb, we identified 12,758
SNPs and 96 indels.
Experimental validation was used to estimate and control the FDR
fornovelvariants(SupplementaryTable3).TheFDRforeachcomplete
call set was controlled to be less than 5% for SNPs and short indels,
and less than 10% for structural variants. Because in an initial test
almost all of the sites that we called that were already in dbSNP were
validated (285 out of 286), in most subsequent validation experiments
we tested only novel variants and extrapolated to obtain the overall
FDR. This process will underestimate the true FDR if more SNPs listed
in dbSNP are false positives for some call sets. The FDR for novel
variants was 2.6% for trio SNPs, 10.9% for low-coverage SNPs, and
1.7% for low-coverage indels (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4a, b).
Variation detected by the project is not evenly distributed across
the genome: certain regions, such as the human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) and subtelomeric regions, show high rates of variation,
whereas others, for example a 5-Mb gene-dense and highly conserved
region around 3p21, show very low levels of variation (Supplementary
Fig. 3a). At the chromosomal scale we see strong correlation between
different forms of variation, particularly between SNPs and indels
(Supplementary Fig. 3b). However, we also find heterogeneity particular to types of structural variant, for example structural variants
resulting from non-allelic homologous recombination are apparently
enriched in the HLA and subtelomeric regions (Supplementary Fig.
Variant novelty
As expected, the vast majority of sites variant in any given individual
were already present in dbSNP; the proportion newly discovered differed substantially among populations, variant types and allele frequencies (Fig. 1). Novel SNPs had a strong tendency to be found
only in one analysis panel (set of related populations; Fig. 1a). For
SNPs also present in dbSNP version 129 (the last release before 1000
Genomes Project data), only 25% were specific to a single low-coverage
analysis panel and 56% were found in all panels. On the other hand,
84% of newly discovered SNPs were specific to a single analysis panel
whereas only 4% were found in all analysis panels. In the exon project,

where increased depth of coverage and sample size resulted in a higher
fraction of low-frequency variants among discovered sites, 96% of
novel variants were restricted to samples from a single analysis panel.
In contrast, many novel structural variants were identified in all analysis panels, reflecting the lower degree of previous characterization
(Supplementary Fig. 4).
Populations with African ancestry contributed the largest number
of variants and contained the highest fraction of novel variants,
reflecting the greater diversity in African populations. For example,
63% of novel SNPs in the low-coverage project and 44% in the exon
project were discovered in the African populations, compared to 33%
and 22% in the European ancestry populations.
The larger sample sizes in the exon and low-coverage projects
allowed us to detect a large number of low-frequency variants
(MAF ,5%, Fig. 1b). Compared to the distribution expected from
population genetic theory (the neutral coalescent with constant population size), we saw an excess of lower frequency variants in the exon
project, reflecting purifying selection against weakly deleterious
mutations and recent population growth. There are signs of a similar
excess in the low-coverage project SNPs, truncated below 5% variant
allele frequency by reduction in power of our call set to discover
variants in this range, as discussed below.
As expected, nearly all of the high-frequency SNPs discovered here
were already present in dbSNP; this was particularly true in coding
regions (Fig. 1c). The public databases were much less complete for
SNPs at low frequencies, for short indels and for structural variants
(Fig. 1d). For example, in contrast to coding SNPs (91% of common
coding SNPs described here were already present in dbSNP), approximately 50% of common short indels observed in this project were
novel. These results are expected given the sample sizes used in the
sequencing efforts that discovered most of the SNPs previously in
dbSNP, and the more limited, and lower resolution, efforts to characterize indels and larger structural variation across the genome.
The number of structural variants that we observed declined rapidly
with increasing variant length (Fig. 1d), with notable peaks corresponding to Alus and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs). The proportion of larger structural variants that was novel depended markedly
on allele size, with variants 10bp to 5 kb in size most likely to be novel
(Fig. 1d). This is expected, as large (.5 kb) deletions and duplications
were previously discovered using array-based approaches17,18, whereas
smallerstructuralvariants(apartfrompolymorphicAluinsertions)had
been less well ascertained before this study.
Mitochondrial and Y chromosome sequences
Deep coverage of the mitochondrial genome allowed us to manually
curate sequences for 163 samples (Supplementary Information).
Although variants that were fixed within an individual were consistent
mitochondrial
(Supplementary Fig. 5), we found a considerable amount of variation
within individuals (heteroplasmy). For example, length heteroplasmy
was detected in 79% of individuals compared with 52% using capillary
sequencing19, largely in the control region (Supplementary Fig. 6a).
Base-substitution heteroplasmy was observed in 45% of samples, seven
times higher than reported in the control region alone19, and was
spread throughout the molecule (Supplementary Fig. 6b). The extent
to which this heteroplasmy arose in cell culture remains unknown, but
appears low (Supplementary Information).
The Y chromosome was sequenced at an average depth of 1.83 in
the 77 males in the low-coverage project, and 15.23 depth in the two
trio fathers. Using customized analysis methods (Supplementary
Information), we identified 2,870 variable sites, 74% novel, with 55
out of 56 passing independent validation. The Y chromosome phylogeny derived from the new variants identified novel, well supported
clades within some of the 12 major haplogroups represented among
the samples (for example, O2b in China and Japan; Supplementary
Fig. 7). A striking pattern indicative of a recent rapid expansion

specific to haplogroup R1b was observed, consistent with the postulated Neolithic origin of this haplogroup in Europe20.
Power to detect variants
The ability of sequencing to detect a site that is segregating in the
population is dominated by two factors: whether the non-reference
allele is present among the individuals chosen for sequencing, and the
number of high-quality and well-mapped reads that overlap the variant site in individuals who carry it. Simple models show that for a
given total amount of sequencing, the number of variants discovered
is maximized by sequencing many samples at low coverage21,22. This is
because high coverage of a few genomes, although providing the highest sensitivity and accuracy in genotyping a single individual, involves
considerable redundancy and misses variation not represented by
those samples. The low-coverage project provides us with an empirical
view of the power of low-coverage sequencing to detect variants of
different types and frequencies.
Figure 2a shows the rate of discovery of variants in the CEU (see
Box 1 for definitions of this and other populations) samples of the
low-coverage project as assessed by comparison to external data
sources: HapMap and the exon project for SNPs and array CGH
data18 for large deletions. We estimate that although the low-coverage
project had only ,25% power to detect singleton SNPs, power to
detect SNPs present five times in the 120 sampled chromosomes
was ,90% (depending on the comparator), and power was essentially
complete for those present ten or more times. Similar results were
seen in the YRI and CHB1JPT analysis panels at high allele counts,
but slightly worse performance for variants present five times (,85%
and 75%, respectively, at HapMap II sites; Supplementary Fig. 8).
These results indicate that SNP discovery is less affected by the extent
of LD (which is lowest in the YRI) than by sequencing coverage
(which was lowest in the CHB and JPT panels).
For deletions larger than 500 bp, power was approximately 40% for
singletons and reached 90% for variants present ten times or more in
the sample set. Our use of several algorithms for structural variant
discovery ensured that all major mechanistic subclasses of deletions
were found in our analyses (Supplementary Fig. 9). The lack of appropriate comparator data sets for short indels and larger structural
variants other than deletions prevented a detailed assessment of the
power to detect these types of variants. However, power to detect short
indels was approximately 70% for variants present at least five times in
the sample, based on the rediscovery of indels in samples overlapping
with the SeattleSNPs project23. Extrapolating from comparisons to
Alu insertions discovered in the J. C. Venter genome24 indicated an
average sensitivity for common mobile element insertions of about
75%. Analysis of a set of duplications18 indicated that only 30–40% of
common duplications were discovered here, mostly as deletions with
respect to the reference. Methods capable of discovering inversions
and novel sequence insertions in low-coverage data with comparable
specificity remain to be developed.
In summary, low-coverage shotgun sequencing provided modest
power for singletons in each sample (,25–40%), and very good power
for variants seen five or more times in the samples sequenced. We
estimate that there was approximately 95% power to find SNPs with
5% allele frequency in the sequenced samples, and nearly 90% power
to find SNPs with 5% allele frequency in populations related by 1%
divergence (Fig. 2b). Thus, we believe that the projects found almost
all accessible common variation in the sequenced populations and the
vast majority of common variants in closely related populations.
Genotype accuracy
Genotypes, and, where possible, haplotypes, were inferred for most
variants in each project (see Supplementary Information and Table 1).
For the low-coverage data, statistically phased SNP genotypes were
derived by using LD structure in addition to sequence information at
each site, in part guided by the HapMap 3 phased haplotypes. SNP
genotype accuracy varied considerably between projects (trio, low
coverage and exon), and as a function of coverage and allele frequency. In the low-coverage project, the overall genotype error rate
(based on a consensus of multiple methods) was 1–3% (Fig. 2c and
Supplementary Fig. 10). The use of HapMap 3 data greatly assisted
phasing of the CEU and YRI samples, for which the HapMap 3 genotypes were phased by transmission, but had a more modest effect on

genotype calls at HapMap II sites not in HapMap 3 that were called in the exon
project target region, and on the y axis is shown the number of these calls that
were not variant (that is, are reference homozygote and thus incorrectly were
called as variant) according to HapMap II. Each point plotted corresponds to a

Supplementary Information).
The accuracy at heterozygous sites, a more sensitive measure than
overall accuracy, was approximately 90% for the lowest frequency
variants, increased to over 95% for intermediate frequencies, and
dropped to 70–80% for the highest frequency variants (that is, those
where the reference allele is the rare allele). We note that these numbers are derived from sites that can be genotyped using array technology, and performance may be lower in harder to access regions of the
genome. We find only minor differences in genotype accuracy
between populations, reflecting differences in coverage as well as
haplotype diversity and extent of LD.
The accuracy of genotypes for large deletions was assessed against
previous array-based analyses18 (Supplementary Fig. 11). The genotype error rate across all allele frequencies and genotypes was ,1%,
with the accuracy of heterozygous genotypes at low (MAF ,3%),
intermediate (MAF ,50%) and high-frequency (MAF .97%) variants estimated at 86%, 97% and 83%, respectively. The greater apparent genotype accuracy of structural variants compared to SNPs in the
low-coverage project reflects the increased number of informative
reads per individual for variants of large size and a bias in the known
large deletion genotype set for larger, easier to genotype variants.
For calling genotypes in the low-coverage samples, the utility of
using LD information in addition to sequence data at each site was
demonstrated by comparison to genotypes of the exon project, which
were derived independently for each site using high-coverage data.
Figure 2d shows the SNP genotype error rate as a function of depth at
the genotyped sites in CEU. A similar number of variants was called,
and at comparable accuracy, using minimum 43 depth in the lowcoverage project as was obtained with minimum 153 depth in the
exon project. To genotype a high fraction of sites both projects needed
to make calls at sites with low coverage, and the LD-based calling
strategy for the low-coverage project used imputation to make calls
at nearly 15% more sites with only a modest increase in error rate.
The accuracy and completeness of the individual genome
sequences in the low-coverage project could be estimated from the
trio mothers, each of whom was sequenced to high coverage, and for
whom data subsampled to 43 were included in the low-coverage
analysis. Comparison of the SNP genotypes in the two projects
showed that where the CEU mother had at least one variant allele
according to the trio analysis, in 96.9% of cases the variant was also
identified in the low-coverage project and in 93.8% of cases the genotype was accurately inferred. For the YRI trio mother the equivalent
figures are 95.0% and 88.4%, respectively (note that false positives in
the trio calls will lead to underestimates of the accuracy).
Putative functional variants
An individual’s genome contains many variants of functional consequence, ranging from the beneficial to the highly deleterious. We
estimated that an individual typically differs from the reference
human genome sequence at 10,000–11,000 non-synonymous sites
(sequence differences that lead to differences in the protein sequence)
in addition to 10,000–12,000 synonymous sites (differences in coding
exons that do not lead to differences in the protein sequence; Table 2).
We found a much smaller number of variants likely to have greater
functional impact: 190–210 in-frame indels, 80–100 premature stop
codons, 40–50 splice-site-disrupting variants and 220–250 deletions
that shift reading frame, in each individual. We estimated that each
genome is heterozygous for 50–100 variants classified by the Human
Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) as causing inherited disorders
(HGMD-DM). Estimates from the different pilot projects were consistent with each other, taking into consideration differences in power
to detect low-frequency variants, fraction of the accessible genome
and population differences (Table 2), as well as with previous observations based on personal genome sequences10,11. Collectively, we
refer to the 340–400 premature stops, splice-site disruptions and
frame shifts, affecting 250–300 genes per individual, as putative
loss-of-function (LOF) variants.
In total, we found 68,300 non-synonymous SNPs, 34,161 of which
were novel (Table 2). In an early analysis, 21,657 non-synonymous
SNPs were validated as polymorphic in 620 samples using a custom
genotyping array (Supplementary Information). The mean minor
allele frequency in the array data was 2.2% for 4,573 novel variants,
and 26.2% for previously discovered variants.
Overall we rediscovered 671 (1.3%) of the 50,361 coding single
nucleotide variants in HGMD-DM (Supplementary Table 5). The
types of disease for which variants were identified were biased towards
certain categories (Supplementary Fig. 12), with diseases associated
with the eye and reproduction significantly over represented and
diseases of the nervous system significantly under represented.
These biases reflect multiple factors including differences in the fitness effects of the variants, the extent of medical genetics research and
differences in the false reporting rate among ‘disease causing’ variants.
As expected, and consistent with purifying selection, putative functional variants had an allele frequency spectrum depleted at higher allele
frequencies,withputativeLOFvariantsshowingthiseffectmorestrongly
(Supplementary Fig. 13). Of the low-coverage non-synonymous, stopintroducing, splice-disrupting and HGMD-DM variants, 67.3%, 77.3%,
82.2% and 84.7% were private to single populations, compared to 61.1%
for synonymous variants. Across these same functional classes, 15.8%,
25.9%, 21.6% and 19.9% of variants were found in only a single individual, compared to 11.8% of synonymous variants.
The tendency for deleterious functional variants to have lower allele
frequencies has consequences for the discovery and analysis of this
type of variation. In the deeply sequenced CEU trio father, who was
not included in the low-coverage project, 97.8% of all single base
variants had been found in the low-coverage project, but only 95%
of non-synonymous, 88% of stop-inducing and 85% of HGMD-DM
variants. The missed variants correspond to 389 non-synonymous, 11
stop-inducing and 13 HGMD-DM variants. As sample size increases,
the number of novel variants per sequenced individual will decrease,
but only slowly. Analyses based on the exon project data (Fig. 3)

showed that, on average, 99% of the synonymous variants in an individual would be found in 100 deeply sequenced samples, whereas 250
samples would be required to find 99% of non-synonymous variants
and 320 samples would still find only 97.4% of the LOF variants
present in an individual. Using detection power data from Fig. 2a,
we estimated that 250 samples sequenced at low coverage would be
needed to find 99% of the synonymous variants in an individual, and
with 320 sequenced samples 98.5% of non-synonymous and 96.3% of
LOF variants would be found.
Application to association studies
Whole-genome sequencing enables all genetic variants present in a
sample set to be tested directly for association with a given disease or
trait.Toquantifythebenefit of having more complete ascertainmentof
genetic variation beyond that achievable with genotyping arrays, we
carried out expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) association tests
on the 142 low-coverage samples for which expression data are available in the cell lines25. When association analysis (Spearman rank
correlation, FDR ,5%, eQTLs within 50 kb of probe) was performed
using all sites discovered in the low-coverage project, a larger number
of significant eQTLs (increase of ,20% to 50%) was observed as
compared to association analysis restricted to sites present on the
Illumina 1M chip (Supplementary Table 6). The increase was lower
in the CHB1JPT and CEU samples, where greater LD exists between
previously examined and newly discovered variants, and higher in the
YRI samples, where there are more novel variants and less LD. These
results indicate that, while modern genotyping arrays capture most of
the common variation, there remain substantial additional contributionstophenotypic variationfromthe variantsnot wellcapturedbythe
Population sequencing of large phenotyped cohorts will allow
direct association tests for low-frequency variants, with a resolution
determined by the LD structure. An alternative that is less expensive,
albeit less accurate, is to impute variants from a sequenced reference
panel into previously genotyped samples26,27. We evaluated the accuracy of imputation that uses the current low-coverage project haplotypes as the reference panel. Specifically, we compared genotypes
derived by deep sequencing of one individual in each trio (the fathers)
with genotypes derived using the HapMap 3 genotype data (which
combined data from the Affymetrix 6.0 and Illumina 1M arrays) in
those same two individuals and imputation based on the low-coverage
project haplotypes to fill in their missing genotypes. At variant sites
(that is, where the father was not homozygous for the reference
sequence), imputation accuracy was highest for SNPs at which the
minor allele was observed at least six times in our low-coverage samples, with an error rate of ,4% in CEU and ,10% in YRI, and became
progressively worse for rarer SNPs, with error rates of 35% for sites
where the minor allele was observed only twice in the low-coverage
samples (Fig. 4a).
Althoughthe ability toimpute rare variantsaccuratelyfromthe 1000
Genomes Project resource is currently limited, the completeness of the
resource nevertheless increases power to detect association signals. To
demonstrate the utility of imputation in disease samples, we imputed
into an eQTL study of ,400 children of European ancestry28 using the
low-coverage pilot data and HapMap II as reference panels. By comparison to directly genotyped sites we estimated that the effective
sample size at variants imputed from the pilot CEU low-coverage data
set is 91% of the true sample size for variants with allele frequencies
above 10%, 76% in the allele frequency range 4–6%, and 54% in the
range 1–2%. Imputing over 6 million variants from the low-coverage
project data increased the number of detected cis-eQTLs by ,16%,
compared to a 9% increase with imputing from HapMap II (FDR 5%,
signal within 50 kb of transcript; for an example see Fig. 4b).
In addition to this modest increase in the number of discoveries,
testing almost all common variants allows identification of many
additional candidate variants that might underlie each association.
For example, we find that rs11078928, a variant in a splice site for
GSDMB, is in strong LD with SNPs near ORMDL3, previously associated with asthma, Crohn’s disease, type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid
arthritis, thus leading to the hypothesis that GSDMB could be the
causative gene in these associations. Although rs11078928 is not
newly discovered, it was not included in HapMap or on commercial
SNP arrays, and thus could not have been identified as associated with

these diseases before this project. Similarly, a recent study29 used
project data to show that coding variants in APOL1 probably underlie
a major risk for kidney disease in African-Americans previously
attributed (at a lower effect size) to MYH9. These examples demonstrate the value of having much more complete information on LD,
the almost complete set of common variants, and putative functional
variants in known association intervals.
Testingalmostallcommonvariantsalsoallowsustoexaminegeneral
properties of genetic association signals. The NHGRI GWAS catalogue
 described
1,227 unique SNPs associated with one or more traits (P , 53 1028).
Of these, 1,185 (96.5%) are present in the low-coverage CEU data set.
Under 30% of these are either annotated as non-synonymous variants
(77, 6.5%) or in substantial LD (r2 . 0.5) with a non-synonymous
variant (272, 23%). In the latter group, only 93 (8.4%) are in strong
LD(r2 . 0.9)withanon-synonymous variant.Becausewetested,95%
ofcommonvariation,theseresults indicate thatnomorethan one-third
of complex trait association signals are likely to be caused by common
coding variation. Although it remains to be seen whether reported
associations are better explained through weak LD to coding variants
with strong effects, these results are consistent with the view that most
contributions of common variation to complex traits are regulatory in
Mutation, recombination and natural selection
Project sequence data allowed us to investigate fundamental processes
that shape human genetic variation including mutation, recombination and natural selection.
Detecting de novo mutations in trio samples
Deep sequencing of individuals within a pedigree offers the potential
to detect de novo germline mutation events. Our approach was to
allow a relatively high FDR in an initial screen to capture a large
fraction of true events and then use a second technology to rule out
false-positive mutations.
In the CEU and YRI trios, respectively, 3,236 and 2,750 candidate
de novo germline single-base mutations were selected for further
study, based on their presence in the child but not the parents. Of
these, 1,001 (CEU) and 669 (YRI) were validated by re-sequencing the
cell line DNA. When these were tested for segregation to offspring
(CEU) or in non-clonal DNA from whole blood (YRI), only 49 CEU
and 35 YRI candidates were confirmed as true germline mutations.
Correcting for the fraction of the genome accessible to this analysis
provided an estimate of the per generation base pair mutation rate of
1.2 3 1028 and 1.0 3 1028 in the CEU and YRI trios, respectively.
These values are similar to estimates obtained from indirect evolutionary comparisons30, direct studies based on pathogenic mutations31, and a recent analysis of a single family32.
We infer that the remaining vast majority (952 CEU and 634 YRI)
of the validated variants were somatic or cell line mutations. The
greater number of these validated non-germline mutations in the
CEU cell line perhaps reflects the greater age of the CEU cell culture.
Across the two trio offspring, we observed a single, synonymous,
coding germline mutation, and 17 coding non-germline mutations
of which 16 were non-synonymous, perhaps indicative of selection
during cell culture.
Although the number of non-germline variants found per individual is a very small fraction of the total number of variants per
individual (,0.03% for the CEU child and ,0.02% for the YRI child),
these variants will not be shared between samples. Assuming that the
number of non-germline mutations in these two trios is representative
of all cell line DNA we analysed, we estimate that non-germline mutations might constitute 0.36% and 2.4% of all variants, and 0.61% and
3.1% of functional variants, in the low-coverage and exon pilots,
respectively. In larger samples, of thousands, the overall false-positive
rates from cell line mutations would become significant, and confound
interpretation, indicating that large-scale studies should use DNA
from primary tissue, such as blood, where possible.
The effects of selection on local variation
Natural selection can affect levels of DNA variation around genes in
several ways: strongly deleterious mutations will be rapidly eliminated
by natural selection, weakly deleterious mutations may segregate in
populations but rarely become fixed, and selection at nearby sites
(both purifying and adaptive) reduces genetic variation through background selection33 and the hitch-hiking effect34. The effect of these
different forces on genetic variation can be disentangled by examining
patterns of diversity and divergence within and around known functional elements. The low-coverage data enables, for the first time,
genome-wide analysis of such patterns in multiple populations.
Figure 5a (top panel) shows the pattern of diversity relative to genic
regions measured by aggregating estimates of heterozygosity around
protein-coding genes. Within genes, exons harbour the least diversity
(about 50% of that of introns) and 59 and 39 UTRs harbour slightly less
diversity than immediate flanking regions and introns. However, this
variation in diversity is fully explained by the level of divergence

(Fig. 5a, bottom panel), consistent with the common part of the allele
frequency spectrum being dominated by effectively neutral variants,
and weakly deleterious variants contributing only to the rare end of
the frequency spectrum.
In contrast, diversity in the immediate vicinity of genes (scaled by
divergence) is reduced by approximately 10% relative to sites distant
from any gene (Fig. 5b). Although a similar reduction has been seen
previously in gene-dense regions35, project data enable the scale of the
effect to be determined. We find that the reduction extends up to
0.1 cM away from genes, typically 85 kb, indicating that selection at
linked sites restricts variation relative to neutral levels across the
majority of the human genome.
Population differentiation and positive selection
Previous inferences about demographic history and the role of local
adaptation in shaping human genetic variation made from genomewide genotype data4,36,37 have been limited by the partial and complex
ascertainment of SNPs on genotyping arrays. Although data from the
1000 Genomes Project pilots are neither fully comprehensive nor fully
free of ascertainment bias (issues include low power for rare variants,
noise in allele frequency estimates, some false positives, non-random
data collection across samples, platforms and populations, and the use
of imputedgenotypes),they canbe used to address key questions about
the extent of differentiation among populations, the presence of highly
differentiated variants and the ability to fine-map signals of local
adaptation.
Although the average level of population differentiation is low (at
sites genotyped inall populations themeanvalue ofWright’sFstis0.071
between CEU and YRI, 0.083 between YRI and CHB1JPT, and 0.052
between CHB1JPT andCEU),wefindseveralhundred thousandSNPs
with large allele frequency differences in each population comparison
(Fig. 5c). As seen in previous studies4,37, the most highly differentiated
sites were enriched for non-synonymous variants, indicative of the
action of local adaptation. The completeness of common variant discovery in the low-coverage resource enables new perspectives in the
search for local adaptation. First, it provides a more comprehensive
catalogue of fixed differences between populations, of which there are
very few: two between CEU and CHB1JPT (including the A111T
missense variant in SLC24A5 (ref. 38) contributing to light skin colour),
four between CEU and YRI (including the 246 GATA box null mutation upstream of DARC39, the Duffy O allele leading to Plasmodium
vivax malaria resistance) and 72 between CHB1JPT and YRI (including 24 around the exocyst complex component gene EXOC6B); see
Supplementary Table 7 for a complete list. Second, it provides new
candidates for selected variants, genes and pathways. For example, we
identified 139 non-synonymous variants showing large allele frequency
differences (at least 0.8) between populations (Supplementary Table 8),
including at least two genes involved in meiotic recombination—
FANCA (ninth most extreme non-synonymous SNP in CEU versus
CHB1JPT) and TEX15 (thirteenth most extreme non-synonymous
SNPinCEUversusYRI,andtwenty-sixthmostextremenon-synonymous SNP in CHB1JPT versus YRI). Because we are finding almost all
common variants in each population, these lists should contain the vast
majority of the near fixed differences among these populations. Finally,
it improves the fine mapping of selective sweeps (Supplementary Fig.
14) and analysis of the dynamics of location adaptation. For example,
we find that the signal of population differentiation around high Fst
genic SNPsdropsbyhalfwithin, onaverage, lessthan0.05cM(typically
30–50 kb; Fig. 5d). Furthermore, 51% of such variants are polymorphic
in both populations. These observations indicate that much local
adaptation has occurred by selection acting on existing variation rather
than new mutation.
The effect of recombination on local sequence evolution
We estimated a fine-scale genetic map from the phased low-coverage
genotypes. Recombination hotspots were narrower than previously
estimated4 (mean hotspot width of 2.3 kb compared to 5.5 kb in
HapMap II; Fig. 6a), although, unexpectedly, the estimated average
peak recombination rate in hotspots is lower in YRI (13 cM Mb21)
than in CEU and CHB1JPT (20cM Mb21). In addition, crossover
activity is less concentrated in the genome in YRI, with 70% of recombination occurring in 10% of the sequence rather than 80% of the
recombination for CEU and CHB1JPT (Fig. 6b). A possible biological
basis for these differences is that PRDM9, which binds a DNA motif
strongly enriched in hotspots and influences the activity of LD-defined
hotspots40–43, shows length variation in its DNA-binding zinc fingers
within populations, and substantial differentiation between African
and non-African populations, with a greater allelic diversity in
Africa43. This could mean greater diversity of hotspot locations within
Africa and therefore a less concentrated picture in this data set of
recombination and lower usage of LD-defined hotspots (which require
evidence in at least two populations and therefore will not reflect hotspots present only in Africa).
The low-coverage data also allowed us to address a long-standing
debate about whether recombination has any local mutagenic effect.
Direct examination of diversity around hotspots defined from LD
data are potentially biased (because the detection of hotspots requires
variation to be present), but we can, without bias, examine rates of
SNP variation and recombination around the PRDM9 binding motif

associated with hotspots. Figure 6c shows the local recombination rate
and pattern of SNP variation around the motif compared to the same
plots around a motif that is a single base difference away. Although the
motif is associated with a sharp peak in recombination rate, there is no
systematic effect on local rates of SNP variation. We infer that,
although recombination may influence the fate of new mutations,
for example through biased gene conversion, there is no evidence that
it influences the rate at which new variants appear.
Discussion
The 1000 Genomes Project launched in 2008 with the goal of creating
a public reference database for DNA polymorphism that is 95% complete at allele frequency 1%, and more complete for common variants
and exonic variants, in each of multiple human population groups.
The three pilot projects described here were designed to develop and
evaluate methods to use high-throughput sequencing to achieve these
goals. The results indicate (1) that robust protocols now exist for
generating both whole-genome shotgun and targeted sequence data;
(2) that algorithms to detect variants from each of these designs have
been validated; and (3) that low-coverage sequencing offers an efficient approach to detect variation genome wide, whereas targeted
sequencing offers an efficient approach to detect and accurately genotype rare variants in regions of functional interest (such as exons).
Data from the pilot projects are already informing medical genetic
studies. As shown in our analysis of previous eQTL data sets, a more
complete catalogue of genetic variation can identify signals previously
missed and markedly increase the number of identified candidate
functional alleles at each locus. Project data have been used to impute
over 6 million genetic variants into GWAS, for traits as diverse as
smoking44 and multiple sclerosis45, as an exclusionary filter in
Mendelian disease studies46 and tumour sequencing studies, and to
design the next generation of genotyping arrays.
Theresults fromthis studyalsoprovidea templatefor future genomewide sequencing studies on larger sample sets. Our plans for achieving
the 1000 Genomes Project goals are described in Box 2. Other studies
using phenotyped samples are already using components of the design
and analysis framework described above.
Measurement of human DNA variation is an essential prerequisite
for carrying out human genetics research. The 1000 Genomes Project
represents a step towards a complete description of human DNA
polymorphism. The larger data set provided by the full 1000
Genomes Project will allow more accurate imputation of variants in
GWAS and thus better localization of disease-associated variants. The
project will provide a template for studies using genome-wide
sequence data. Applications of these data, and the methods developed
to generate them, will contribute to a much more comprehensive
understanding of the role of inherited DNA variation in human history, evolution and disease.
METHODS SUMMARY
The Supplementary Information provides full details of samples, data generation
protocols, read mapping, SNP calling, short insertion and deletion calling, structural variation calling and de novo assembly. Details of methods used in the
analyses relating to imputation, mutation rate estimation, functional annotation,
population genetics and extrapolation to the full project are also presented.

Design of the full 1000 Genomes
The production phase of the full 1000 Genomes Project will combine
low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, array-based genotyping,
and deep targeted sequencing of all coding regions in 2,500
individuals from five large regions of the world (five population
samples of 100 in or with ancestry from each of Europe, East Asia,
South Asia and West Africa, and seven populations totalling 500 from
the Americas; Supplementary Table 9). We will increase the lowcoverage average depth to over 43 per individual, and use bloodderived DNA where possible to minimize somatic and cell-line false
positives.
A clustered sampling approach was chosen to improve lowfrequency variant detection in comparison to a design in which a
smaller number of populations was sampled to a greater depth. In a
region containing a cluster of related populations, genetic drift can
lead variants that are at low frequency overall to be more common
(hence, easily detectable) in one population but less common (hence,
likely to be undetectable) in another. We modelled this process using
project data (see Supplementary Information) assuming that five
sampled populations are equally closely related to each other
(Fst 51%). We found that the low-coverage sequencing in this design
would discover 95% of variants in the accessible genome at 1%
frequency across each broad geographic region, between 90% and
95% of variants at 1% frequency in any one of the sampled
populations, and about 85% of variants at 1% frequency in any
equally related but unsampled population. Box 2 Figure shows
predicted discovery curves for variants at different frequencies with
details as for Fig. 2b. The model is conservative, in that it ignores
migration and the contribution to discovery from more distantly
related populations, each of which will increase sensitivity for variants
in any given population. In exons, the full project should have 95%
power to detect variants at a frequency of 0.3% and approximately
60% power for variants at a frequency of 0.1%.
In additionto improved detection power,we expectthe fullprojectto
have increased genotype accuracy due to (1) advances in sequencing
technology that are reducing per base error rates and alignment
artefacts; (2) increased sample size, which improves imputationbased methods; (3) ongoing algorithmic improvements; and (4) the
designing by the project of genotyping assays that will directly
genotypeup to10million common and low-frequency variants (SNPs,
indels and structural variants) observed in the low-coverage data. In
addition, we expect the fraction of the genome that is accessible to
increase. Longer read lengths, improved protocols for generating
paired reads, and the use of more powerful assembly and alignment
methods are expected to increase accessibility from under 85% to
above 90% of the reference genome (Supplementary Fig. 15).
