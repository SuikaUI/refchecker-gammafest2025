Background: The closure of educational activities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia due to the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic resulted in an unplanned shift from traditional learning to a setup that exclusively involves digital
teaching and learning. Within this context, the present study aimed to explore undergraduate medical students’
perceptions regarding the effectiveness of synchronized online learning at Unaizah College of Medicine and
Medical Sciences, Qassim University, Saudi Arabia.
Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using virtual focus group discussions synchronously with the help of
a discussion guide consisting of seven open-ended questions. Overall, 60 medical students were recruited using a
maximum variation sampling technique; these students then participated in eight focus group discussions. All
interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed for thematic contents using the standard (Mayring,
Kiger. M. E. and Braun.V) content analysis framework.
Results: A thematic content analysis yielded four core themes: (1) educational impact, (2) time management, (3)
challenges encountered, and (4) preferences for the future. The online modality was well-received, and all
participants agreed that online sessions were time saving and that their performance was improved due to
enhanced utility of time; however, they indicated that they encountered some challenges, including
methodological, content perception, technical, and behavioral challenges during sessions and online exams. Most
of the preclinical students preferred online learning for the upcoming academic years.
Conclusion: Synchronized online classes were well-accepted by the medical students. This represents significant
and promising potential for the future of medical education. The principles of the online learning model and
learning outcomes should be rigorously and regularly evaluated to monitor its effectiveness.

Background
The Covid-19 pandemic started in December 2019 in
Wuhan, China and spread around the world rapidly
within months. The pandemic affected all areas of life,
including education. As the situation worsened, the global lockdown culminated in a lockdown of educational
institutions. This closing of schools, colleges, and universities resulted in a stressful event for educational administration with highly limited options. The Saudi Ministry
of Education announced online classes to continue the
learning process in a safe and secure manner. All universities including medical universities were shifted to online learning within days . This massive unplanned
transition from traditional learning to an exclusively online learning setup has changed the methods of medical
institutions in delivering the courses for their students.
Medical graduates of the twenty-first century are exposed to online textbooks and modules with video lectures and computer-based exams. With this evolution in
teaching modalities, a “flipped classroom” model for
learning has been adopted by many medical schools
around the world . Although these experiences of
medical institutions are not similar, this can at least help
them in accepting synchronized online models in this
critical period.
Online learning is classified as synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous technology allows for “live”
interaction between the instructor and the students (e.g.,
audioconferencing, videoconferencing, web chats etc.)
while asynchronous technology involves significant delays in time between instruction and its receipt (e.g., Email, earlier video recording, discussion forums etc.) .
It has long been acknowledged that online instructional methods are an efficient tool for learning ;
however, online learning can be challenging for students
because of the limited non-verbal communication. Other
aspects, such as students’ and professors’ interactions,
accessibility of materials, and time management, can also
affect the opinions of online education participants .
To assess students’ performance in an online course, a
representative set of face-to-face courses should be compared to a similar set of online courses. This strategy
was adopted in a study that involved utilizing a dataset
of hundreds of courses being taught at 23 colleges of
Virginia’s community college system; the authors found
that students’ performance was worse in online courses
with respect to both course persistence and end-ofcourse grades .
Online learning in medical education can lead to more
effective and easier access to a greater quantity of information, especially in uncertain global situations such as
pandemics . There is no doubt that the current
COVID-19 pandemic has augmented the focus on online
learning in education, but we anticipate that in the
future, this shift will prove to be a permanent trend in
medical education. The methods used by Unaizah College
of Medicine and Medical Sciences included lectures, case
discussions, 4-box case analysis, clinical case discussions,
online seminars, and dry labs (online laboratory demonstrations). The largest proportion was covered through
lectures, which was about 60%, while case discussions (including 4-box case analysis and clinical case discussions)
consisted of 20%, Online seminars consisted of 10% and
dry laboratories made about 10% of courses. We conducted this qualitative study to assess the effectiveness of
these techniques and the barriers to medical students’ engagement in online learning . The foremost
goal of our exploratory study is to determine medical
students’ perceptions and satisfaction level regarding
synchronous online learning methods implemented in
courses during their second semester as an emergency
intervention during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic in
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Study design
We employed an online focus group qualitative design
for our study for numerous reasons. Firstly, this design
enables an interactive and in-depth exploration of respondents’ experiences . Secondly, the group
process can help individuals to clarify views that might
not emerge from a one-on-one interview. In addition, it
can uncover extensive opinions that individuals hold
about an issue, as well as perceptive differences among
individuals and groups . Therefore, to effectively address the objectives of our study, focus group discussions
were the most suitable choice. The discussions were
conducted online because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and social distancing in the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia and because this approach was cost-effective
 . It also ensured a detailed probing of the perceptions, expectations, and difficulties and was timed so as
to generate recommendations for improvements and hypotheses that can be tested in future research.
Study participants
Participants were purposely sampled. To ensure sufficient diversity of opinion among groups, medical students in their first year through final year (attending
online courses during their second semester) studying at
Unaizah College of Medicine and Medical Sciences,
Saudi Arabia, were recruited using a maximum variation
sampling technique . Roll-call lists of medical students were used as a sampling frame to select the participants. The class leaders of the first-year class through
the final-year class were contacted. The reason for
selecting class leaders first was that they had direct contact with the instructors and their classmates. As a
Khalil et al. BMC Medical Education 20:285
 
result, they acted as connectors, and other participants
were selected with the help of those class leaders. Upon
contact, each student had been introduced to the background of our study and was invited to participate.
Overall, 60 students participated in eight focus group
discussions, and each group had seven to eight participants. A satisfactory (40/60) male-to-female participant
ratio was maintained in discussions. Focus group discussions were continued unless the saturation of new information was encountered.
The students who opted to participate in our study received an e-mail with information about the use of the
online focus groups’ forum along with a discussion guide
to generate discussion. Each of them was given a personal log-in name and password to access the online
forum. For data collection, only the moderators had access to the forum. The anonymity of statements in the
transcripts and in the final report was ensured, as well as
the confidentiality and security of the data. Because data
collection was done through the Internet, participants
provided informed consent by clicking a button after
having read all relevant information.
Study setting and data collection
The electronic focus group synchronous discussions
were based on a discussion guide which was developed
by two authors (OW and AM), in consultation with experts for this study. The guide was revised and approved
by all authors, and piloted with four students. It consisted of seven open-ended questions, allowing participants to discuss as many elements as possible. The focus
group discussions were conducted during the months of
April and May 2020 by dual moderators.
The forum for each group started with an introduction
and proceeded with questions for participants about
their experiences with online learning, the differences
between online learning and on-campus-learning, difficulties encountered, challenges, level of satisfaction with
online evaluation, and preferences regarding learning
modalities for their next academic year. All students in
each focus group simultaneously took part in a live synchronous session for discussion by logging into the website. The students used an online conferencing website,
and their discussions were audio-recorded. Two moderators were present; one ensured the smooth progression
of the focus group sessions, and the other made sure
that the topics in questions were all covered. Dualmoderator focus groups resulted in highly productive
sessions. Each group discussion took between 90 and
120 min. During the final two focus groups discussions,
moderators agreed that saturation had been reached and
that the inclusion of more respondents would thus be
unnecessary.
Data analysis
Discussions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and
analyzed by summarizing content analysis developed by
Mayring , Kiger. M. E , and Braun. V . This
helped to condense the data into essential content in a
systematic manner guided by sequential steps. The main
themes of the data were based on the discussion questions. An inductive process was used for analysis and to
assign a code for each meaningful sentence and then
gather similar codes in overarching sub-themes. Finally,
similar sub-themes were grouped together under a main
theme reflecting its sub-themes. The data was analyzed
and coded by all authors. Two authors performed a preliminary analysis, with the remaining authors acting as
second coders for the data. Subsequently, the initial coding was reviewed and compared. It was then contemplated and refined until a consensus was achieved
among all authors, which led to a more representative
coding scheme, sub-themes, and themes.
In total, eight online synchronous focus group discussions were conducted. Each group included seven to
eight participants. There were a total of 60 respondents,
and more than half (60%; n = 36) of the participants were
female. The approximate male/female students’ distribution within Unaizah College of Medicine and Medical
Sciences is 44/56. Half of the sample participants (50%;
n = 30) were between 21 and 22 years old. Almost three
fourth of the participants (72%, n = 43) resided within
the city (Unaizah) where their medical college campus
was located, as indicated in Table 1.
During the analysis, sub-themes were identified and
classified under four major themes, which are summarized below with relevant quotes from the participants.
Four core themes included the following: (1) educational impact (2), time management (3), challenges encountered (4), and preferences for future as indicated in
Theme 1: educational impact
The educational impact of online courses identified by
the respondents of our study are discussed under two
sub-themes, including (1) content understanding and (2)
content perception challenges.
The first sub-theme concerned the experience of content understanding. Although our study participants
held different opinions about content understanding
through online classes, two-thirds of them agreed that it
works better for some disciplines, which they elaborated
upon in the following statements:
Khalil et al. BMC Medical Education 20:285
 
“In my opinion, online classes proved to be an excellent opportunity for theoretical subjects like basic
sciences but not suitable for clinical subjects like
clinical skills etc.”
Experiences of clinical students were different from
preclinical students. Some of the fourth-year and fifthyear students found online classes highly beneficial, and
they expressed their views as follows:
“Some online learning courses are very useful, such
as radiology and we were really benefited from online sessions like seminars and case discussions.”
“Online classes provided me with great opportunities to focus on applied courses like radiology, forensic medicine.”
Almost all of the students regarded it as an opportunity to utilize recorded lectures to better understand and
master the content. They revealed the following:
“Lectures recording option in online learning, benefited us a lot! I can listen to the lecture again and
again, at my convenience and can make notes very
easily. I consider it, a wonderful experience at the
end of this academic year.”
“Yes, there is no doubt that online classes are better

lectures are very helpful. It helped me a lot in
my academic progress this year.”
The second sub-theme which emerged concerned content perception challenges, which encompass variations
in demand of content reception and learning by different
types of learners. Under this sub-theme, participants’
expressed the following views:
“I faced difficulty in understanding some of the
lectures, especially those containing x-rays, were not
clear in the online sessions.”
“In my opinion, non-verbal communication like eye
contact with the instructor is essential to establish
learning process. Campus learning allows discussion
among students which is very helpful for clearing a
lot of concepts.”
“For me, online lectures are useful only for theoretical
explanation of the content but I miss clinics! Absence
of the clinical practice and labs is problematic for me
to master the practical concepts.”
Theme 2: time management
Participants generally referred to the theme of time
management as a dominant perspective, and they all
agreed that online sessions saved time for them and that
their performance had improved as a result. This is
made evident in the following statements:
“Online sessions provided me with a great time to
study and I experienced better time management.”
“I live away from the college campus and it usually
takes two hours daily to reach college. So, these
online classes saved my time by reducing my daily
exertion of going to campus and coming back
experienced
contentment
courses because of their physical ease and because being
within their comfort zone reduced their anxiety. They
expressed their views in the following statements:
“Online classes had a positive effect on me in terms
of saving time and effort, by reducing the campusbased distractions like compulsive participation in
conversions, adjustment with unavoidable noise and
waste of time in finding a proper place to study alone.”
“I thoroughly enjoyed online courses. I used to
choose a comfortable place at my home for my
online classes and it also gave me a chance to relax
at my convenience. It really saved my time and
effort to study well.”
“Online learning has a positive impact on my sleep
pattern and I felt more comfortable and balanced.”
Most of the participants were satisfied with online
courses because they were able to spend more time with
their families. One stated the following:
“I experienced an entirely new method of time
management with online sessions. Online classes
allowed me to save time for my studies and I found
more time to sit with my family and enjoy quality
refreshing time, whenever I wanted to take a break
between my studies.”
Theme 3: challenges encountered
The participants encountered some challenges and identified barriers to the acquisition of knowledge through
online courses. These are discussed under the following
three sub-themes here: (1) methodological challenges
(2), technical challenges (4), and behavioral challenges.
The first sub-theme, which can be regarded as a negative aspect from the perspective of participants, was
methodological challenges, which included quality assurance issues in the content delivery of the lectures and
implementation issues. Adjustment and engagement in
the new system was perceived as a barrier to the development and implementation of online learning, and
there were multiple problems related to the duration
and arrangement of learning sessions. Some participants
expressed their ideas about these issues as follows:
“It felt like, some of the online lectures were
unnecessarily allotted long time! The sequence of
the online lectures was also suboptimal and there
was a frequent change of lecture timing. I felt
difficulty in connecting the information out of
content heaps.”
“There were a lot of lectures scheduled in one day!
Honestly speaking, I didn’t get time to study them
well. Most of the lectures’ content was huge and
was covered within limited time and some of the
instructors were not committed to the time of the
lecture. It felt like we are taking lectures whole day.”
“The duration of some lectures was very long!
Instructors were not committed to the allotted
time of the lectures. Some instructors were late
for the lectures and did not start it on time.
The lectures were frequent during the day and
at night.”
Khalil et al. BMC Medical Education 20:285
 
“I noticed a serious communication gap between
students and instructor. At time I needed more
clarification for some lecture content but those
points were left unexplained by the instructors
because of miscommunication. I missed direct discussions with my instructors and my classmates
during campus-classes.”
Technical challenges faced by the participants are discussed under the second sub-theme. This includes all essential technical elements, such as internet connectivity
and the use of online tools. Participants listed many
technical issues which they faced during online sessions,
as mentioned in the following statements:
internet connectivity
communication
software failure were among frequent technical issues
which I faced during whole course. Second big issue
was, most of our instructors have no experience in
delivering online lecture. There was a wastage of time
every day because of technical problems.”
“I used to face very frequent internet disconnection
during online lectures daily and it was very hard for
me to follow lectures with instructors.”
“My participation was greatly affected by issues like
delayed download the lectures and internet lagging!
The technical problems like troubled sound due to
pressure on the internet software was very common
during online sessions.”
“Some instructors were not in a habit of checking
their microphones before starting their lectures, so
there was interrupted voice which led to unnecessary
inconvenience and botheration.”
“Sometimes instructor’s voice was not clear and
they didn’t use appropriate explanatory tools given
in the online software. It led to wastage of time
which could be otherwise avoided.”
Behavioral and acceptability challenges are discussed
under our third sub-theme, which encompasses negative
attitudes towards the adoption of new modes of learning.
Participants’ perspectives about their acceptability of
online learning is quite discernible from the following
statements:
“It’s not suitable for me because I am a visual
and kinesthetic learner. I must admit that even
though online classes helped me in raising my
marks, but it did not help me in upgradation of
my knowledge.”
“Even though, I managed to cope up with online
teaching but I desperately missed body language like
eye to eye contact with instructors and writing on
the board. I missed active interactive sessions like
team-based learning sessions, peer instruction skills
and discussion among students. I prefer to study
within campus ambit.”
“Most of the times, I did not find a suitable place at
home for taking my online classes and I felt like
environment is not suitable at home for attending
online lectures.”
“My family did not realize that I am seriously busy
in learning through online system and that put a lot
of pressure on me.”
“If online lectures are continued then, I am afraid
that it will lead to laziness and its negatively affecting
my performance, as it takes me longer to study the
“The best thing about online lectures was “recorded
lectures”, but at the same time the drawback was, I
could not link the theoretical concepts together
through recorded lectures. It simply doesn’t work
“Online learning kept me away from my family, and
it feels like I am always busy in my lectures and
“While learning through online sessions, I had no
time to enjoy my social life. I feel like I am busy all
the time with my lectures and I lost interaction with
my classmates.”
Theme 4: preferences for the future
The students were asked about their preferences regarding their next academic year. Mixed responses were conveyed. The majority of them preferred online learning,
while others, especially clinical students, expressed interest in the continuation of campus-bound classes and live
participation.
statements
campus-based classes included the following:
“It is time saving to study together to master some difficult concepts. Some lectures that need active discussion and eye to eye contact with instructors while
others need joint study like team-based learning skills.”
“Courses that require practical application, such as
women and children health, cannot be taught
though online sessions.”
Khalil et al. BMC Medical Education 20:285
 
“It was an unpleasant experience. Please do not
repeat it in any course of next academic year. In my
opinion, college campus and clinics are most
suitable for learning because it provides us with a
special learning environment.”
“Well, it did not help me much in my academic
progress. Clinical practice and direct learning at
campus though live lectures is better, as eyes to
eye contact with the instructors helps in better
understanding of content.”
Online experience of learning was preferred by some
students, but they suggested some conditions in case of
its continuation. The following statements elaborated
upon this:
“I prefer online learning, provided the doctor should
use the online teaching tools like writing on screen,
highlighting the text etc.”
“I prefer to continue with online learning in upcoming
academic year, only in the fields of scientific research
and forensic medicine.”
“I agree to continue online sessions for some
courses like radiology but it cannot be applied in all
courses, especially clinical courses. Excellent in
theoretical courses but unsatisfactory experience in
practical courses.”
“Online learning is better than studying in college
campus and is preferable for female students like
me who lives outside Unaizah.”
“I would like to continue online classes if system is
fool-proof and well prepared before we start using it
again. I mean the technical part.”
“Online learning is excellent and saves time for
studying. I suggest that there should be one day per
week specified for online learning to cover some
theoretical
Discussion
Our research study examined undergraduate medical
students’ perspectives and preferences regarding online
modules of synchronized learning. The concept of online
classes is not new in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in
relation to online synchronized learning in medical education at the undergraduate level, no research was previously conducted in the Kingdom.
In our analysis, we have identified the factors influencing the medical students’ assent or dissent in relation
to synchronized online learning. Assenting students in
our study were motivated by the benefit of mastering
the content in less time compared to campus learning.
They utilized updated educational technologies which
fulfilled the requirements of adult learners by promoting
active and student-centered learning. This instructional
method helped empower learners in controlling their
educational needs constructively and provides them with
structured guidance for self-directed learning . Eventually, this enables students to utilize their time productively to achieve their individual goals. Additionally, most
of the students in this study found more time to spend
with their families and to improve their sleep pattern.
However, some students mentioned some negative factors
related to managing their time. The overall satisfaction
level with online learning was found to be high in our
study, and students’ attitudes were quite positive towards
online learning as a new teaching modality relative to
traditional didactics. This finding is consistent with previous research on online learning modalities .
However, our study assessed the individual learning
experiences using online modules, and we found that
the use of online learning is more productive within the
context of particular medical disciplines, such as for
basic medical sciences or preclinical subjects; this made
it difficult to compare its relative effectiveness with clinical disciplines . That is why more preclinical
students preferred online learning for their future academic years, as compared to clinical students who
participated in our study. Conversely, Cardall S. conducted a study in 2008 which concluded that preclinical students preferred to have live lectures when
given an option; the authors agreed that online lectures are an efficient method for the acquisition of
knowledge .
According to our study participants, the missing element in the effectiveness of online learning was clinical
practice. Nothing can replace seeing a patient because
clinical experience and human interaction are extremely
important for the practice of medicine. However, online
learning may serve as an efficient resource for clinical
students if the method is upgraded through the integration
of modalities such as virtual simulation technologies and
computer-based models of real-life processes. This can produce multiple benefits for clinical learners by providing
controlled opportunities to practice rare and critical events
in safe environments excluding the risk to patients. An instructional technology, such as a computer-based virtual
patient program designed to simulate real-life clinical scenarios, can be useful for clinical learners to facilitate
history-taking and physical examination and can encourage
diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making .
Khalil et al. BMC Medical Education 20:285
 
Although the themes that emerged from this study
support the notion that “online learning works for medical students,” this does not imply that online learning
can completely replace in-person live sessions. Our
study participants encountered numerous challenges in
adopting online learning. One of the most common barriers was technical insufficiency, including poor internet
connectivity and deficits in educators’ basic computer
skills. The themes identified in our study complement
numerous previous studies . The high-yielding
technological use in medical education depends on the
faculty’s readiness and expertise to employ the technology to facilitate learning. Training physicians with these
skills need a divergence from traditional teaching methodology. Hence, it appears that training in educational
technology mastery is a neglected competency in faculties which should be mandatory for the enhancement of
medical universities .
Aside from technical issues, our study participants’ experiences were influenced by the individual characteristics of students themselves, such as their learning styles,
acceptance of new learning modalities, and levels of engagement in online classes . Other barriers included quality assurance issues in the implementation of
online learning by the institution. This finding is consistent with a study performed by Bediang et al. in 2013, in
which the authors concluded that one of the most imperative means for implementing online modules is encouraging collaboration among all departments and
stakeholders. An organized and clear institutional approach is required to formulate a well-regulated and efficient
facilitate
structured methodologies by faculty members while
implementing an online learning module .
A lack of non-verbal communication by instructors
was also identified as a significant challenge for our
study participants. According to communication theorists, verbal messages are conveyed through words,
whereas nonverbal messages are conveyed beyond the
actual meaning of words, which typically complements
the spoken words . The psychological closeness
which a student may feel with their instructor is primarily based upon the instructor’s nonverbal clues. Nonverbal communication, such as eye contact, gestures, and
posture, comprise a major part of all communications.
Conclusion
Our study concludes that synchronized online learning
was well-received by the medical students. At the same
time, some challenges for our study participants included technical issues, individual behavioral characteristics, institutional methodology barriers, and the
non-verbal
preclinical
students were more likely to opt for online lectures
as their preference for the next academic year compared to clinical students.
Limitations
There are some limitations to this study. The findings of
this study cannot be generalized because it was conducted in only one medical school. Although four core
themes and a number of subthemes emerged from our
study, the authors are aware that there must be other
potential strengths and weaknesses of this modality for
undergraduate medical students. Secondly, to ensure the
effectiveness of online learning modules for undergraduate medical students, the principles of online learning
model and learning outcomes should be rigorously and
regularly evaluated.
Recommendations
The findings of our research support the evidence regarding the effectiveness of online learning for medical
students; however, it is important to realize that it is not
the only mode of transferring efficient knowledge. Of
course, there are other teaching modalities and clinical
teaching which are essential to implement as compulsory parts of an ideal undergraduate medical education
model. Thus, the online module’s predominately synchronized learning represents a meaningful and promising potential for the future of medical education and can
be integrated into the curriculum to enhance the effectiveness for lifelong learning.
There is a need for research to identify other effective
online and offline teaching modalities and to formulate a
meticulous model through the integration of an optimal
proportion of online learning in undergraduate medical
education.
