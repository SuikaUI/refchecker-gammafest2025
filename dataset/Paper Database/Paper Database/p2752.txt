Engagement
Graduate students in six online courses were asked to complete a questionnaire related to dimensions of
engagement including participation and interaction, performance, studying, and relevance of material.
Students were asked to indicate the importance of various online course features (e.g., online
discussions) in enhancing their engagement in each dimension using a Likert scale. Twenty-six (29%)
students completed the questionnaire. Students rated most course management system features as
extremely important or very important. When the ratings for the four engagement areas were grouped by
course site feature, the feature with the highest mean rating was “instructor feedback on assignments/
assessments.” The feature with the lowest mean rating was “online chats with other students.” While the
practices of the instructor in the courses studied may have influenced the students’ perceptions, it is clear
that students especially value contact with the instructor.

Graduate Student Perceptions of the Use of Online Course Tools
to Support Engagement
College student retention is important for both the college
and the student. Rates of retention in online courses are
generally lower than in face-to-face courses . With
increasing enrollments in online courses, it is important to
explore methods that could be used in the online classroom to
increase retention rates in these courses. While multiple
theoretical models of student persistence have been proposed,
most show that retention increases with increasing levels of
academic and social engagement .
Handelsman, Briggs, Sullivan, and Towler identified four
factors of student course engagement including skills
engagement, participation/interaction engagement, emotional
engagement, and performance engagement, and Ausburn
 determined that students ranked most important online
course features related to structure (e.g., the syllabus). The
purpose of the current study was to determine if students
perceived specific tools available in an online course
management system (e.g., course announcements, email from
instructor, discussion board postings) to be more effective than
others in increasing their engagement in the course in the four
areas identified above.
Literature Review
Pedagogical Practices to Increase Engagement in
Traditional Courses
Tinto recognized the importance of the classroom for
both the social and academic integration of students. Kuh,
Kinzie, Buckley, Bridges, and Hayek reported, “Student
engagement in educationally purposeful activities was positively
related to both grades and persistence” (p. 45). They reported
that increased graduation rates were correlated to participation
in effective educational practices as determined by the National Survey of Student
Engagement.
Various pedagogical strategies may increase student
engagement. Pascarella and Terenzini emphasized that
pedagogical approaches focusing on active learning as well as
those involving lecture may be used to promote learning. Kuh et
al. noted the benefit of using “such engaging pedagogies
as active and collaborative learning, classroom-based problem
solving, peer teaching, service learning, and various forms of
electronic technologies” (p. 92). Kuh, Kinzie, Schuh, and Whitt
 stated that active and collaborative learning strategies
included the following as measured by the NSSE:
(1) Asking questions in class or contributing to class
discussions or both, (2) making class presentations, (3)
working with other students on class projects inside or
outside of class, (4) tutoring other students, (5)
participating in a community-based project as part of a
course, and (6) discussing ideas from readings or classes
with other students, family members, or others outside of
class. (p. 193)
According to Kuh et al. , “What students do during
college counts more in terms of what they learn and whether
they will persist in college than who they are or even where they
go to college” (p. 8). Similarly, Tinto concluded by
saying, “Ultimately the success of our actions on behalf of
student learning and retention depends upon the daily actions of
all members of the institution, not on the sporadic efforts of a
few officially designated members of a retention committee” measured student engagement in online courses and
found that students did not report any particular activity as
increasing engagement but rather a variety of activities as
effective. Students did indicate that levels of instructor presence
and student presence were important for increasing student
engagement. Results also suggested that providing multiple
means for communication and interaction between the student
and instructor as well as among students led to increased levels
of engagement.
In a study of graduate students in an online program, Levy
 found that students valued “collaborative, social, and
passive learning activities,” “formal communication activities,”
and “formal learning activities” (p. 51), as well as the more
practical activities related to logistics (e.g., downloading the
syllabus and assignment guidelines) and printing materials.
Young found that graduate and undergraduate students
enrolled in online courses found the following items to be
effective teaching practices: “adapting to student needs, using
meaningful examples, motivating students to do their best,
facilitating the course effectively, delivering a valuable course,
communicating effectively, and showing concern for student
learning” (p. 65).
Online Course Management System Features
Course management systems are widely used in the delivery of
online courses, and a variety of features are available for use by
instructors and students. Ausburn found that adult
students in a blended learning environment most valued course
design elements “containing options, personalization, selfdirection, variety, and a learning community” (p. 327). When
asked to rank features according to their importance to the
student as a distance learner, students ranked highest the
features related to structure (e.g., announcements and
reminders, syllabus, and assignment instructions). Next, they
ranked features related to content (e.g., slide presentations and
Internet sites), followed by features related to convenience . Finally, students ranked features related to
communication (e.g., discussion boards and e-mail) last.
Measuring Engagement
Numerous measures of student engagement have been
developed and used. In addition, measures of the effectiveness
of various online course management system features have been
developed. Handelsman et al. developed the Student
Course Engagement Questionnaire (SCEQ) in order to measure
student engagement in particular courses. They determined four
dimensions of engagement including skills engagement,
participation/interaction engagement, emotional engagement,
and performance engagement. Dixson modified the SCEQ
to create the Online Engagement Scale, an instrument to
measure student engagement in online courses. Ausburn 
developed a questionnaire listing the online course features
available to her adult students through the course management
system and asked the students to rank the features according to
how important the features were to them.
Since the number of students taking online courses is
increasing, understanding factors which contribute to student
engagement in online courses is important. More research is
needed comparing various pedagogical methods used in distance
education as research comparing distance education to the
traditional classroom is extensive . In an effort to better understand
features of online course management systems which may affect
student engagement and thus student persistence, the research
reported here examined graduate students’ perceptions of the
effectiveness of various online course management system
features (e.g., course announcements, email from instructor,
discussion board postings) on increasing their engagement in the
course in four areas identified by research as factors of student
course engagement : 1) skills (e.g.,
studying, reading materials), 2) emotional (e.g., making course
interesting and relevant), 3) participation/interaction (e.g.,
asking questions, participating in discussions), and 4)
performance (e.g., getting good grades).
Graduate Student Perceptions of Online Course Engagement
 
Participants
All students enrolled in at least one of six fully online graduate
courses over a period of two semesters in 2011 at a land-grant
university in the southeastern United States were invited to
participate in the study. The author was the instructor for the
course and emailed the students through the course
management system to ask them to participate. The courses
were designed for students interested in working in the
community college as administrators, faculty, or workforce
development personnel or for students interested in working in
industry in the area of workforce development. The instructor
provided a detailed syllabus at the beginning of the semester as
well as weekly announcements to serve as reminders of what
was due. For each topic covered in the course (approximately
eight per course), the instructor provided assigned readings,
written lecture materials with links to related Web sites, a
discussion board prompt to which students were required to
respond, and a written assignment or test. The students were
also encouraged, but not required, to communicate with the
instructor and other students using email, online chats,
telephone, and/or face-to-face visits. The students were also
encouraged to introduce themselves to one another through the
discussion board at the beginning of the semester, and the
instructor provided information about herself and ways to
contact her as well. Students were able to monitor their progress
by reading feedback provided by the instructor for assignments
and tests and by accessing their grades through the course
management system.
A pilot study was conducted in 2010; ten students were
randomly selected to complete the questionnaire and provide
feedback, and six students did so. The questionnaire was
modified slightly based on the feedback provided by the pilot
participants. Those students who participated in the pilot study
were not included in the study. The university’s Institutional
Review Board (IRB) approved this study.
IJ-SoTL, Vol. 8 , No. 1, Art. 5
 
In the spring semester of 2011, 14 of 53 (26%) students
completed the questionnaire. During the fall semester of 2011,
12 of 37 (32%) students completed the questionnaire. Students
were asked to indicate their gender, age, enrollment status (i.e.,
full-time or part-time), and major. Of the respondents, 73%
were female and 58% were enrolled full-time. For age, 42%
indicated 20-29, 38.5% indicated 30-39, 8% indicated 40-49,
and 11.5% indicated 50-59. For major, 38.5% indicated they
were enrolled in a master’s degree program in the department,
38.5% indicated they were enrolled in a doctoral program in the
department, and 23% indicated they were enrolled in other
Materials and Procedures
For this study, the researcher adapted the items in the SCEQ
developed by Handelsman et al. and the Online
Engagement Scale developed by Dixson as well as
features of the online course management system noted by
Ausburn to develop a questionnaire for students in online
graduate courses (see Appendix). The questionnaire consisted of
four items related to dimensions of engagement including 1)
participation and interaction in the class: engaging in online
conversations with instructor and other students, helping other
students, and getting to know other students; 2) performance in
the class: getting a good grade and doing well on tests; 3)
studying on a regular basis, keeping up with readings, and
taking/reviewing notes; and 4) making material relevant and
interesting, helping you apply course material, and increasing
your desire to learn material. Below each item, the questionnaire
included a list of features often found in course management
systems, and students were asked to indicate the importance of
each of the online course features in enhancing their
engagement using a Likert scale. Each student was also asked to
indicate his or her gender, age, enrollment status, and major.
Students were asked to complete the questionnaire and to return
it to the researcher, who was also the instructor in the courses,
via email.
Graduate Student Perceptions of Online Course Engagement
 
This study assessed graduate students’ perceptions of the
effectiveness of various course management system features in
increasing their engagement in one of six courses. Twenty-six
students completed a questionnaire with four sets of Likertscaled questions related to engagement in the areas of
participation, performance, studying, and relevance. Students
rated most course management system features as extremely
important or very important. Of the 1450 total responses given,
1157 (79.8%) were extremely important or very important.
For statistical analysis, student ratings were converted to
numerical scores: extremely important (five points), very
important (four points), somewhat important (three points),
slightly important (two points), and not at all important (one
point), and frequency distributions and measures of central
tendency were used to determine results. When the ratings for
the four engagement areas were grouped by course site feature,
the features with the highest mean ratings related to feedback
and information from the instructor while the lowest mean
ratings related to interactions with other students (see Table 1
for students’ ratings of the four areas combined).

Increasing enrollments in online courses has led to concern
about the retention of students in these courses .
Overall, the present study indicated that students perceived that
various course management system features were important to
their engagement in the courses, rating most features as
extremely important or very important. Most theoretical models
Graduate Student Perceptions of Online Course Engagement
 
indicate that increasing the level of academic engagement may
lead to higher retention rates . These results
add to the growing body of literature related to increasing
student engagement in order to increase retention by indicating
that various course management site features may be useful
tools in increasing levels of student engagement.
Kuh et al. noted the importance of student-faculty
interaction in increasing student retention. In the online
classroom, students value communication and interaction with
faculty and other students . In the present study, students rated most highly
“instructor feedback on assignments/assessments.” Other
features rated high by students were “email to and from the
instructor” and “access to grades.” Students in the online
environment may have felt that the feedback provided by the
instructor was important to help them improve their performance
on future assignments and tests and to help them understand
the relevance of the assignment to their learning and career
goals. Students may feel somewhat isolated in the online
environment and may especially value interaction with the
instructor that is specifically targeted to the individual student
rather than the group as a whole.
Pascarella and Terenzini noted the usefulness of
lecture to promote learning. In the present study, over 90% of
students rated course materials such as handouts and lecture
outlines as extremely important or very important for
performance, studying, and making material relevant and
interesting. Much of the responsibility for mastering the course
material rested with the student and his or her ability to read the
assigned material and ask questions when clarification was
needed. The lecture materials may have aided students in this
Levy noted the importance students placed on
logistical activities such as downloading the syllabus and
assignments. In the present study, over 90% of students rated
information about assignments as extremely important or very
important for performance, studying, and making material
relevant and interesting. Perhaps the information enhanced their
IJ-SoTL, Vol. 8 , No. 1, Art. 5
 
engagement in the course as they studied and completed the
assignments.
Pascarella and Terenzini as well as Kuh et al.
 noted the importance of activities involving active
learning, such as contributing to class discussions and working
with other students on projects. In the present study, “online
discussions with other students” and “email to and from other
students” were rated low. This may reflect the traditional style of
instruction, in which the instructor is the center of the learning
experience, to which the students were accustomed.
Overall, students rated most course management system
features as extremely important or very important. This is in
agreement with Dixson who found that students reported
a variety of activities in online courses as effective for increasing
engagement. Students in the current study especially valued
contact with the instructor as well as information about
assignments, course materials, and grades. Similarly, Ausburn
 found that adult students ranked highest course
management system features related to structure and content
when asked to rank features according to their importance to the
student as a distance learner. Young also found that
students perceived effective communication and course
facilitation as important in online teaching. The students in the
current study least valued chat sessions and discussions,
especially with other students. Ausburn also found that
students ranked features related to communication low. Also,
while in agreement about the importance of instructor presence
as indicated by students in Dixson , the importance of
student presence was not indicated in the present study. This
may have been influenced by the requirements of the course,
and the importance of student interaction may have increased
with more emphasis on active and collaborative learning as
suggested by Kuh et al. .
Implications for Practice
Students indicated that they valued all course management
system features to some degree. But overall, students rated
instructor feedback as most valuable, especially for their
Graduate Student Perceptions of Online Course Engagement
 
performance, participation, and seeing relevance in the material.
Instructors should be careful to provide students with thorough
and timely feedback on their work so that students can more
fully understand what they did well and what needs
improvement prior to completing additional assignments.
Students also valued information provided by the instructor,
particularly lecture outlines and information about assignments,
especially for their performance, participation, and seeing
relevance in the material. Since students do not receive the
face-to-face instruction that occurs in a traditional classroom, it
is imperative that instructors help students understand the key
points from materials they are assigned to read, listen to, or
view and also to provide clear guidance about how students
should complete assignments. Finally, while students valued
various communication tools to increase their participation in the
course, students rated email to and from the instructor as
valuable for all areas of engagement. It is important that
instructors establish preferred means of communication with
students and respond promptly to students who seek assistance.
Students may feel as if they are alone in taking the course and
simply need reassurance that others, especially the instructor,
are accessible, or they may need clarification regarding some
component of the course.
Limitations and Future Directions
There are some limitations in the present study, and the ideas
for future research noted below may address these limitations.
First, there was no consideration of how much students actually
used the various course management system features. For
example, the online chat function was not required and thus was
rarely, if ever, used by students or the instructor. Future studies
could track usage using the tracking features of the course
management system and consider the amount of tool usage in
overall considerations of its importance for engagement. Second,
students’ abilities to use various forms of technology vary as
some students come into a course with prior experiences using
the system, or a similar system, or have advanced skills using
technology as compared to other students. These students may
IJ-SoTL, Vol. 8 , No. 1, Art. 5
 
be more likely to use and see the value of the features. Future
research may consider the skill levels of the students alongside
their ratings of the features. Finally, course management
systems are continually changing, and new features are often
available to students. The features assessed in this study may be
made obsolete as new features are introduced. Future research
may probe deeper into the reasons why students value certain
features of a course management system to more fully
understand which learning strategies facilitated by the features,
rather than the features themselves, students value to increase
their engagement in their online courses. By doing so,
instructors could adapt their practices to incorporate the most
appropriate features in order for students to meet their learning
outcomes. In addition, future research may consider various
types of active learning strategies that may be incorporated into
online courses and the role they play in increasing student
engagement.
