Objectives: Since the ﬁrst case of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) identiﬁed on Jan 20, 2020, in South
Korea, the number of cases rapidly increased, resulting in 6284 cases including 42 deaths as of Mar 6,
2020. To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we present the ﬁrst study to report the reproduction
number of COVID-19 in South Korea.
Methods: The daily conﬁrmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available
sources. By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth
model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution
of the generation interval.
Results: We identiﬁed four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4–1.6).
In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7), and the scaling of growth
parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-
19. The crude case fatality rate is higher among males (1.1%) compared to females (0.4%) and increases
with older age.
Conclusions: Our results indicate an early sustained transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea and support
the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.

Introduction
A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged out of the city
of Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has already demonstrated its
potential to generate explosive outbreaks in conﬁned settings and
cross borders following human mobility patterns .
Fortunately, by Feb 15, 2020, the daily number of newly reported
cases in China started to decline across the country, although Hubei
Province reported 128 cases on average per day in the week of
March 2–8, 2020 . While the epidemic continues to
decline in China, 24,727 COVID-19 cases have been reported in
more than 100 countries outside of China, including South Korea,
Italy, Iran, Japan, Germany, and France . In particular,
South Korea quickly became one of the hardest-hit countries with
COVID-19, exhibiting a steadily increasing number of cases over
the last few days. Hence, it is crucial to monitor the progression of
these outbreaks and assess the effects of various public health
measures, including the social distancing measures in real-time.
The ﬁrst case in South Korea was identiﬁed on Jan 20, 2020,
followed by the detection of one or two cases on average in the
subsequent days. However, the number of conﬁrmed cases of
SARS-CoV-2 infection started to increase rapidly on Feb 19, 2020,
with a total of 6284 conﬁrmed COVID-19 cases including 42 deaths
reported as of Mar 6, 2020, according to the Korea Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) (Table 1). The
epicenter of the South Korean COVID-19 outbreak has been
identiﬁed in Daegu, a city of 2.5 million people, approximately 150
miles South East of Seoul. The rapid spread of COVID-19 in South
Korea has been attributed to one case linked to a superspreading

event that has led to more than 3900 secondary cases stemming
from church services in the city of Daegu .
This has led to sustained transmission chains of COVID-19, with
55% of the cases associated with the church cluster in Daegu
 .
Moreover, three other clusters have been reported, including
one set in Chundo Daenam hospital in Chungdo-gun, Gyeongsanggbuk-do (118 cases), one set in the gym in Cheonan,
Chungcheongnam-do (92 cases), and one Pilgrimage to Israel
cluster in Gyeongsanggbuk-do (49 cases). These few clusters have
become the primary driving force of the infection. A total of 33
cases were imported, while the four major clusters are composed
of local cases, as described in Table 2.
The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Korea is exacerbated by
ampliﬁed transmission in conﬁned settings, including a hospital
and a church in the city of Daegu. The hospital-based outbreak
alone involves 118 individuals, including 9 hospital staff , which is reminiscent of past outbreaks of SARS and MERS
 . To respond to the mounting number of cases
of COVID-19, the Korean government has raised the COVID-19 alert
level to the highest (Level 4) on Feb 23, 2020, to facilitate the
implementation of comprehensive social distancing measures
including enhanced infection control measures in hospitals,
restricting public transportation, canceling of social events, and
delaying the start of school activities .
While the basic reproduction number, denoted by R0, applies at
the outset of an exponentially growing epidemic in the context of
an entirely susceptible population and in the absence of public
health measures and behavior changes, the effective reproduction
number (Rt) quantiﬁes the time-dependent transmission potential.
This key epidemiological parameter tracks the average number of
secondary cases generated per case as the outbreak progresses
over time. Steady values of Rt above 1 indicate sustained disease
transmission, whereas values of Rt <1 do not support sustained
transmission, and the number of new cases is expected to follow a
declining trend. In this report, using a mathematical model
parameterized with case series of the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea,
we investigated the transmission potential and severity of COVID-
19 in Korea using preliminary data of local and imported cases
reported up until Feb 26, 2020.
We obtained the daily series of conﬁrmed cases of COVID-19 in
South Korea from Jan 20, 2020, to Feb 26, 2020, that are publicly
Korea Centers
Control and
Prevention (KCDC) . Our data includes the dates of
reporting for all conﬁrmed cases, the dates of symptom onsets for
the ﬁrst 28 reported cases, and whether the case is autochthonous
(local transmission) or imported. We also summarize the case
clusters comprising one or more cases according to the source of
infection, according to the ﬁeld investigations conducted by the
KCDC . Accordingly, four major clusters were
identiﬁed. The total number of conﬁrmed and suspected cases
as of Mar 6, 2020, as well as the crude case and fatality rate
distribution by gender and age, are presented in Table 1.
Imputing the date of onset
To estimate the growth rate of the epidemic, it is ideal to
characterize the epidemic curve according to dates of symptoms
onset rather than dates of reporting. For the COVID-19 data in
Korea, the symptom onset dates are available for only the ﬁrst 28
reported cases. Moreover, all of the dates of symptoms onset are

available for the imported cases. Therefore, we utilize this
empirical distribution of reporting delays from the onset to
diagnosis to impute the missing dates of onset for the remainder of
the cases with missing data. For this purpose, we reconstruct 300
epidemic curves by dates of symptoms onset from which we derive
a mean incidence curve of local case incidence and drop the last
three data points from the analysis to adjust for reporting delays in
our real-time analysis .
Estimation of reproduction number from daily case incidence
We assess the effective reproduction number, Rt, which
quantiﬁes the time-dependent variations in the average number of
secondary cases generated per case during an outbreak due to
intrinsic factors (decline in susceptible individuals) and extrinsic
factors (behavior changes, cultural factors, and the implementation of public health measures) . Using the Korean incidence
curves for imported and local cases, we estimate the evolution of Rt
for COVID-19 in Korea. First, we characterize daily local case
incidence using a generalized growth model (GGM) . This model describes the growth proﬁle via two parameters:
the growth rate parameter (r) and the scaling of the growth
proﬁles ranging from constant incidence (p ¼ 0), sub-exponential
polynomial
(0 < p < 1),
exponential
(p ¼ 1) . The generation interval is assumed
to follow a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.41 days and a
standard deviation of 3.17 days of the generation interval
using the renewal equation given by
j¼0 ðIij þ a JijÞri
In the renewal equation, we denote the local incidence at
calendar time ti by Ii, and the raw incidence of imported cases at
calendar time ti by Ji. The parameter 0  a  1 quantiﬁes the
relative contribution of imported cases to secondary disease
transmission   . The denominator
represents the total number of cases that contribute to the
incidence cases at time ti: Next, we estimate Rt  for 300 simulated
curves assuming a Poisson error structure to derive the uncertainty
bounds around the curve of Rt  .
Reconstructed incidence of COVID-19
The reconstructed daily incidence curve of COVID-19 after
imputing the onset dates for the Korean cases is shown in Figure 1.
Between Jan 20 and Feb 18, 2020, an average of two new cases were
reported each day, whereas, between February 19–26, 2020, 154
new cases were reported on average each day.
Effective reproduction number (Rt) from daily case incidence
Under the empirical reporting delay distribution from early
Korean cases with available dates of onset, the intrinsic growth rate
(r) was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7) and the scaling of growth
parameter (p) was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8), indicating
sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19 in Korea (Figure 2,
Table 3). The mean reproduction number Rt was estimated at 1.5

sensitive to changes in the parameter that modulates the

The spatial distribution of the Korean clusters is shown in

Shincheonji Church of Jesus cluster
As of Mar 8, 2020, 4482 conﬁrmed cases of COVID-19 are linked
to this cluster, according to the KCDC . This largest
cluster is associated with the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, with the
ﬁrst case (the 31st patient in the country) conﬁrmed on Feb 18. It is
unclear how this case contracted the illness, as she does not
present a recent history of travel or contact with another infected
patient. However, before becoming a symptomatic case of COVID-
19, she visited the hospital in Cheongdo after a minor car accident.
After becoming a symptomatic case of COVID-19, she attended the
Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu twice. According to the KCDC,
the patient had contact with 166 people, primarily at the
Shincheonji Church and the hospital in Cheongdo; all those with
whom the patient had contact, now placed themselves into selfquarantine. The Shincheonji church of Jesus has temporarily closed
its facilities and halted the church activities as of Feb 18, 2020.
Chungdo Daenam hospital cluster
This cluster comprising 118 local cases and seven deaths is
associated with Chungdo Daenam hospital, where South Korea's
ﬁrst coronavirus-associated case fatality occurred. Of the 118 cases,
92 were conﬁrmed on Feb 22, 2020 . A 63-year-old
man who died of pneumonia at the hospital on Feb 19 was
posthumously tested positive for COVID-19. On Feb 21, another
patient at Daenam Hospital died from COVID-19, followed by
another death on Feb 23. The conﬁrmed cases were mainly from
the psychiatric ward and include nine medical staff persons. The
exact route of the infection is not yet known.
Cluster related to the gym in Cheonan
In the central cities of Cheonan, 92 COVID-19 patients were
associated with a Zumba dance class after an instructor became the
5th conﬁrmed case in Cheonan on Feb 25, 2020. According to the
provincial government of South Chungcheong Province, everyone
who attended the class in Cheonan was tested, and 27 cases were

their 30's and 40's . As of Mar 8, 2020, a total of 92
individuals were infected, including Zumba instructors and
students, as well as their families and acquaintances .
Pilgrimage tour to Israel related cluster
This cluster comprised 49 cases as of Mar 8, 2020. This cluster
was identiﬁed when 31 Catholic pilgrims visited Israel between
Feb 8, 2020, and Feb 16, 2020, and were subsequently conﬁrmed to
have COVID-19 . Eleven individuals were diagnosed on Feb
17, 2020; twenty others were conﬁrmed positive between February
21–25, 2020, and immediately quarantined. Of the 31 infected
pilgrims, 19 came from Euiseong County, North Gyeongsang
Province, while one patient, a tour guide, came from Seoul. Health
authorities have traced multiple contacts by the cases of this
cluster, and additional cases were conﬁrmed after that, raising
concerns about the potential risk of secondary infections.
Discussion
This is the ﬁrst study to report estimates of the transmission
potential of COVID-19 in Korea based on the trajectory of the
epidemic, which was reconstructed by using the dates of onset of
the ﬁrst reported cases in Korea. The estimates of R clearly indicate
the sustained transmission of the novel coronavirus in Korea; the
case fatality rate appears to be higher among males and older
populations (Table 1). Moreover, the imported cases contribute
little to secondary disease transmission in Korea, as a majority of
these cases occurred in the early phase of the epidemic, with the
most recent imported case reported on Feb 9, 2020. These ﬁndings
support the range of social distancing interventions that the
Korean government put in place to bring the outbreak under
control as soon as possible.
Our estimates of the reproduction number can be compared
with earlier estimates reported for the epidemic in China, where
the estimates of R lie in the range 2–7.1 . Moreover, the mean R reached
values as high as 11 for the outbreak that unfolded aboard the
Princess Cruises ship during January–February 2020 . In contrast, a recent study on Singapore’s
COVID-19 transmission dynamics reported lower estimates for Rt
(1.1, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.3) as of Feb 19, 2020, reﬂecting a signiﬁcant
impact of the control interventions that were implemented in
Singapore . The estimates of the scaling of
growth parameter (p) in our study indicate sub-exponential
growth dynamics of COVID-19 in Korea. This aligns well with the
sub-exponential growth patterns of COVID-19 in Singapore and all
Chinese provinces except Hubei was identiﬁed in the Shincheonji
Church of Jesus in Daegu cluster. Since then, Korea's conﬁrmed
cases have risen tremendously. In fact, 55% of conﬁrmed cases are
linked to one cluster of infections, i.e., the Shincheonji Church of
Jesus in Daegu . Such superspreading events have
been reported earlier for the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea
 . Ampliﬁcation of MERS in the hospital setting
has been associated with diagnostic delays, which increase the
window of opportunity for the generation of secondary cases
 . This underscores the need for rapid testing,
case detection, and active contact tracing to isolate infectious
individuals.
Beyond Korea, substantial COVID-19 transmission has been
reported in Italy, Iran, Germany, France, and aboard the Diamond
cruise ship . While the Chungdo
Daenam hospital cluster and the cluster related to the Pilgrimage
tour to Israel seem to have stabilized, the other two clusters are still
being consolidated. Public health authorities are currently focused
on containing the outbreak in the city of Daegu, the epicenter of the
outbreak, and North Gyeongsang Province, where active contact
tracing is being conducted. Nation-wide preventative measures are
expected to reduce community transmission and ultimately bring
Rt below one.

This is the ﬁrst study to estimate the transmission potential and
severity of COVID-19 in Korea. Our current ﬁndings suggest that
there is a sustained disease transmission in the region, underscoring the need to implement a wide array of social distancing
measures to rapidly contain the outbreak in Korea, mitigate the
morbidity and mortality impact of the disease, and stem the
number of case exportations to other nations.
