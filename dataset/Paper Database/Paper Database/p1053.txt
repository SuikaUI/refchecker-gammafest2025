Background: Online gaming has become increasingly popular. However, this has led to concerns that these games might
induce serious problems and/or lead to dependence for a minority of players. Aim: The aim of this study was to uncover and
operationalize the components of problematic online gaming.
Methods: A total of 3415 gamers (90% males; mean age 21 years), were recruited through online gaming websites. A
combined method of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied. Latent profile
analysis was applied to identify persons at-risk.
Results: EFA revealed a six-factor structure in the background of problematic online gaming that was also confirmed by a
CFA. For the assessment of the identified six dimensions – preoccupation, overuse, immersion, social isolation, interpersonal
conflicts, and withdrawal – the 18-item Problematic Online Gaming Questionnaire (POGQ) proved to be exceedingly
suitable. Based on the latent profile analysis, 3.4% of the gamer population was considered to be at high risk, while another
15.2% was moderately problematic.
Conclusions: The POGQ seems to be an adequate measurement tool for the differentiated assessment of gaming related
problems on six subscales.

Introduction
The popularity of online gaming has spread at an increasing
rate since its introduction . However, given the increasing
number of studies on the phenomenon of problematic gaming
 , there have been growing concerns about negative
consequences for a small minority. These gamers spend more time
with gaming than planned while ignoring other important
activities causing negative effects on their performance ,
social relationships , and withdrawal symptoms .
There are different names present regarding this phenomenon in
scientific literature. The phenomenon is referred to as addiction
 , problematic use , excessive game use or
engagement . However, all these authors – irrespective of the
name – agree in that there exists an excessive form of online
gaming that shows a problematic pattern and that is related to
behavioral addictions . The present authors propose to use
the name problematic gaming. This term describes both the
quintessence of the phenomenon (i.e., that the behavior is not only
excessive but gaming-related problems are also expected to be
present), while avoiding the notion of dependency (as the exact
definition and diagnostic criteria have not yet been clarified or
The issues outlined above also suggest that precise assessment
and screening of the phenomenon is an urgent matter. In order to
measure the problematic nature of gaming, some authors have
developed questionnaires based on the general phenomenon of
internet addiction , while others have attempted to operationalize the behavioral addiction model of Griffiths .
However, the limitation of these current questionnaires is that
many of them typically target users of Massively Multiplayer
Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG) . Though
this type of game is the most popular among online games, the
total population of gamers is more diverse and it is therefore
necessary to develop a measure that is suitable for the assessment
of other genres and gamer populations such as those who play
online Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games and online First Person
Shooter (FPS) games.
The aim of our study was therefore twofold. Firstly, to explore
what components comprise problematic online gaming. Secondly,
to make these dimensions measurable, to develop such a scale on
which the identified dimensions can be assessed. Contrary to
earlier studies, the objective here was to create a questionnaire
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org

suitable for all types of Massively Multiplayer Online Games. A
further intention was to carry out an empirical based analysis to
ensure that all components of problematic gaming remain in focus.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the Eo¨tvo¨s Lora´nd University. Informed consent was obtained via
our online system from all subjects. After introducing the goals of
the study in details the subjects were asked to tick into a box if they
agreed to continue and participate in the study.
Sample, Procedure and Participants
All Hungarian websites that facilitate the playing online games
were identified (n = 18). All 18 sites were contacted by the research
team and were asked information about the number of visitors,
and requested their cooperation in the planned study. All sites
responded. Based on this information, the number of (ever)
registered users was estimated to be approximately 30,000.
However, many of these users may have simultaneously registered
on multiple sites. Furthermore, it is likely that many formerly
registered users were not currently active. All sites agreed to
publish a call for participation in the present study on their home
sites or via a newsletter. In the call for participation, gamers were
asked to visit the study website, to sign in with a password provided
by the researchers, and to complete a questionnaire. A total of
4390 questionnaires were started but not everyone completed the
whole survey. This left 3415 completed questionnaires. In addition
to answering the general questions regarding online gaming habits,
the respondents were asked about online gaming problems.
Major socio-demographic characteristics of the gamers (gender,
age, qualification, marital status, school, work) and characteristics
regarding their online gaming activities were recorded. Additionally, the survey contained a 26-item questionnaire that listed
several problems regarding online gaming. The 26 items were
created by means of (i) a comprehensive literature review
supplemented with (ii) interviews with online gamers. Firstly, in
relation to the literature review, a full search was carried out in the
databases Web of Science, Science Direct, PsycINFO, and
Medline using the following keywords: online gam*, MMO,
MMORPG, multiplayer, FPS, First Person Shooter, RTS, Real
Time Strategy. A total of 199 hits were found. However, 115 was
excluded because they were irrelevant regarding specific aspects
and characteristics of online gaming. The remaining 84 papers
were read carefully and all items were listed out that could be
considered as reflecting problematic aspects of online gaming. A
total of 42 characteristics were identified this way. Secondly (and
concurrently with the literature review), 15 online gamers were
asked to list problems they had noticed in themselves and/or
others as result of online gaming. These gamers listed 32 problems.
Following exclusion of duplicates and similar items, the list was
reduced to 26 items.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis comprised an exploratory factor analysis
(EFA) with robust maximum-likelihood estimation (MLR) in
MPLUS 6.0. The goodness of fit was assessed by the root-meansquare error of approximation (RMSEA) and its 90% confidence
interval (90% CI), and p value smaller than 0.05 for test of close fit
(Cfit..05). The factor solution was selected based on fit statistics
and interpretability of factors.
The factor structure based on EFA was confirmed through
confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) with independent samples.
CFA was performed with robust maximum-likelihood estimation
(MLR) in MPLUS 6.0. The goodness of fit was evaluated using
RMSEA and its 90% confidence interval (90% CI), p value
smaller than 0.05 for test of close fit, standardized root-meansquare residual (SRMR), comparative fit index (CFI), and Tucker-
Lewis Fit Index (TLI). As Brown and Kline 
recommended, multiple indices were selected in order to provide
different information for evaluating model fit.
To carry out the above analyses, four non-overlapping groups
from the sample were randomly selected. Sample 1 (n = 600) was
used to perform an initial EFA on the original 26 items. Sample 2
(n = 600) was used to conduct a separate EFA to cross-validate the
factor structure found in the first analysis. Sample 3 (n = 600) was
used to conduct CFA analysis. After the inspection of modification
indices, we also cross-validated the final CFA model with sample 4
(n = 1615).
In order to identify the groups of users with high risk of
problematic use of online gaming a person-oriented statistical
framework was selected, seeking subtypes of gamers that exhibited
similar patterns of symptoms of problematic use. Therefore a
latent profile analysis was performed with 1 to 6 classes with the
full sample (n = 3415). The latent profile analysis is a latent
variable analysis with a categorical latent variable – in this case
problematic gamers – and continuous manifest indicators such as
factor scores of POGQ. In the process of determining the number
of latent classes, the Bayesian information criteria parsimony index
was used, alongside the minimization of cross-classification
probabilities, entropy and the interpretability of clusters. In the
final determination of the number of classes, the likelihood-ratio
difference test (Lo-Mendell-Rubin Adjusted LRT Test) was also
used. This compares the estimated model with a model having one
less class than the estimated model . A low p value (,.05)
indicates that the model with one less class is rejected in favor of
the estimated model.
To determine the cut-off point for POGQ a sensitivity analysis
based on membership in the most problematic group in the latent
profile analysis was carried out. Considering membership in this
group as a gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity values for
all POGQ cut-off points was calculated. Thus, the accuracy of the
POGQ by calculating the proportion of participants classified as
being at high risk for problematic gaming versus other gamers
could be assessed. The sensitivity (i.e., the proportion of true
positives belonging to the most problematic group based on LPA)
and specificity (i.e., the proportion of true negatives) was defined as
suggested by Altman and Bland and Glaros and Kline .
In order to explore the probability that the POGQ would give the
correct ‘‘diagnosis’’, the positive predictive values (PPV), the
negative predictive values (NPV), and the accuracy values for each
possible POGQ cut-off points was calculated. PPV was defined as
the proportion of participants with positive test results who are
correctly diagnosed . The NPV was defined as the
proportion of patients with negative test results who are correctly
diagnosed .
Descriptive Statistics
90% of our sample (n = 3072) was male. Mean age was 21 years
(SD = 5.85 years). Slightly more than one-tenth of the participants
had graduate education, while 39.4% had secondary education.
The majority (61.9%) were primarily students, but approximately
one-quarter worked full time (24.3%). Almost two-thirds of the
Problematic Online Gaming Questionnaire (POGQ)
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org
May 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 5 | e36417
participants were single (64.9%), and a further 24.3% were in a
relationship but did not live with their partner (see Table 1).
Slightly more than one-third (35.7%) played a maximum
14 hours per week and approximately the same number played
between 15 and 28 hours per week. One in ten played more than
42 hours a week (6 hours per day on average) (Table 1).
Approximately a half spent money on gaming, although most did
not spend more than $25(US) per month. The majority of the
sample participants were individual gamers (38.6%) but there was
also a relatively high ratio of different level organized gamers
(Table 1).
Exploratory Factor Analyses
An exploratory factor analysis was performed with maximumlikelihood estimation which is robust to non-normality and
promax rotation to evaluate the factor structure of 26 items on
Sample 1 (n = 600). Acceptability of the factor solution was based
on goodness of fit index (RMSEA ,0.08, Cfit (90% CI) ,0.08,
pclose .0.05), the interpretability of the solution and salient factor
loadings (.0.30). A total of 1–8 factor solutions was examined.
The six-factor solution provided the first adequate RMSEA value
(x2 = 409.8,
RMSEA = 0.045 [0.039–0.051] pclose .0.90). The exploratory
factor analysis on Sample 2 (n = 600) was repeated. As in Sample
1, a six-factor solution also provided the first adequate and
interpretable factor solution (x2 = 457.7 df = 184 p,0.0001;
RMSEA = 0.050 [0.044–0.056] Cfit = 0.514). Factor loadings are
presented in Table 2.
For the further development of this scale, items with the
following rules were selected. First, items were excluded that had
factor loadings lower than 0.40 at least in one of the two analyses.
Second, items with salient cross loadings were excluded. If a cross
loading only in one of the two parallel EFAs was identified, the
cutoff 0.50 was used. In case of more than two cross-loadings, a
0.30 as a cutoff was used to exclude items from further analyses.
The excluded items are crossed out in Table 2. As result of the
above criteria, 18 of the original 26 items were retained (see
Appendix S1).
Confirmatory Factor Analysis
Based on the previous analyses on the samples 1 and 2, a sixfactor solution was tested on Sample 3 (n = 600) with confirmatory
factor analysis. This model provided an optimal fit to the data
(x2 = 256.0
CFI = 0.965;
TLI = 0.956;
RMSEA = 0.043 [0.036–0.051] Cfit.0.90; SRMR = 0.037). We
cross-validated this model with Sample 4 (n = 1615) and found
adequate level of fit (x2 = 512.8 df = 120 p,0.0001; CFI = 0.962;
TLI = 0.952;
RMSEA = 0.045
[0.041–0.049]
Cfit.0.90;
SRMR = 0.036). The factor loadings, factor reliabilities, internal
consistencies, means, and SDs are presented in Table 3.
Professional vs. Non-professional Gamers
The possible bias stemming from the inclusion of professional
gamers in the total sample was checked. The level of fit of the
measurement models without professional gamers (N = 2857) was
satisfactory
(x2 = 763.5
CFI = 0.965;
TLI = 0.956; RMSEA = 0.043 [0.040–0.046]; SRMR = 0.034).
The level of fit of the measurement models only among
professional gamers (N = 528) was also satisfactory (x2 = 290.0
df = 120 p,0.0001; CFI = 0.948; TLI = 0.934; RMSEA = 0.052
[0.044–0.059];
SRMR = 0.034).
Furthermore,
multi-group
non-professional
(N = 2857)
professional
(N = 528) gamers was performed. In this analysis, the factor
loadings and intercepts were set equal in both groups. The level of
satisfactory
(x2nonprofessional = 758.6,
x2professional = 302.4
CFI = 0.963;
TLI = 0.957;
RMSEA = 0.042 [0.040–0.045]; SRMR = 0.036) and the means
of latent variables were not statistically different in either group.

Labels of Factors
In the first factor, two items belonged that referred to obsessive
thinking and daydreaming on the online game. This dimension
was named preoccupation. The second factor contained items
concerning the excessive use of online games. The three items
belonging here referred to noticing gaming related problems,
elongated gaming time, and the difficulties in controlling time
spent on gaming. This factor was named overuse. The third factor
was named immersion as these four items indicated dealing
excessively with online games, immersion in gaming, and losing
track of time. The fourth factor indicated damage to social
relationships, and the preference of gaming over social activities.
This three-item dimension was named social isolation. The two
items of the fifth factor referred to the comments of the player’s
social environment on overuse of online games and the related
conflicts, so this factor was named interpersonal conflicts. Finally,
the four items of the sixth factor concerned the appearance of
withdrawal symptoms in cases when players experienced difficulties in gaming as much as they wanted. This dimension got the
name withdrawal.
Latent Profile Analysis
A latent profile analysis was performed on the dimensions of
problematic online gaming, and, a four-class solution was found
according to the decision criteria. As Table 4 demonstrates that
the AIC, BIC and sample-size adjusted BIC continued to decrease
as more latent classes were added. However, a leveling-off after the
four-latent-class solution was noted. In inspection of entropy, the
two-class solution reached the maximum level, but the four-class
solution also provided also an adequate level of entropy. Based on
the L-M-R test, the four-class solution was accepted.
The features of each class are presented in Figure 1. The first
class represents those gamers (47.8% of the total sample) that
scored on dimensions of problematic use below the average. The
second class of gamers (33.7%) represents the low risk of
problematic use. The third class (15.2%) represents the medium
risk of problematic use. Finally, the fourth class (3.4%) represents
the high risk of problematic use. In this latter group, the ‘social
isolation’ factor and ‘withdrawal symptoms’ factor especially
showed an elevated level compared to other dimensions.

Sensitivity
specificity
membership in the fourth class (i.e., being at high risk for
problematic gaming) as a ‘‘gold standard’’, the sensitivity,
specificity, PPV as well as NPV, and accuracy of the POGQ at
all possible cut-off points (Table 5) were calculated.
Based on this analysis, a cut-off score of 65 points is suggested as
an ideal cut-off to be classed as problematic gamer. In this case,
specificity is 100%, while sensitivity is 96%. This means that
practically none of the negative (i.e., non-problematic) cases are
considered as problematic, while only 4% of the true problematic
cases are not recognized. Accuracy, as well as NPV in this case is
100%, while PPV is 90%. Increasing of the cut-off score would
result in the growing number of the false negative cases, whereas
decreasing would lead to more false positive cases.
Discussion
Due to the growing number of indicated problems concerning
online gaming it has become an absolute necessity to develop a
tool with adequate psychometric characteristics for the measurement of the extent of gaming-related problems. The Problematic
Online Gaming Questionnaire (POGQ) developed in this study,
based on the results of the analyses, appears to fulfill those
requirements that are expected from a measure like this. The
POGQ was created in a way that it is applicable for all types of
online games and its empirical basis makes it possible to cover all
problems experienced by the players.
The results of these empirically-based analyses are at the same
time very much supported by the fact that the six dimensions
identified in the background of problematic online gaming fit
closely to the available theoretical frameworks. Griffiths 
proposed a ‘‘components’’ model for addictions that assumes the
six classical symptoms for addiction behaviors in general that is
salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict, and
relapse. The withdrawal and preoccupation components can be
identified with our equally named factors, while conflict dimension
is partly covered by the interpersonal conflicts factor and partly by
the factor overuse (intrapersonal conflicts). It is interesting though
that items explicitly representing salience dimension fell out during
analysis (see item 2, 5, 11 in Table 2.), but the component is still
present in overuse, preoccupation, and social isolation factors. The
relapse component appears in the overuse dimension while mood
modification dimension is primarily present in the withdrawal
factor (item 13 in Table 2).
In another approach, the DSM-IV criteria for psychoactive
substance use dependence by the American Psychiatric Association that are generally regarded as the definitional basis of
behavioral addictions can be considered. These dimensions –
withdrawal, lack of control (unsuccessful attempt to quit), much
time spent on the activity, behavior continues despite knowledge of
adverse consequences, more intensive use and for longer period
than intended – are all clearly reflected in the POGQ. The more
than adequate psychometric properties of the POGQ and the wide
empirical content it is based on, is reassuring regarding the future
use of the scale. However, further tasks include the cross-cultural
validation of the POGQ and clinical validation of the scale.
It is an issue in relation to all behavioral addictions not present
in DSM-IV-TR whether those individuals who engage in a specific
behavior excessively should be regarded as having a disorder, and

with which criteria we should identify individuals functioning on
other pathologic levels. Considering the lack of consensus
regarding definitions, the authors of the present study insisted on
using the expression ‘problematic gaming’ instead of the more
ambiguous gaming dependence. However, the latent profile
analysis performed also indicated that a segment of the online
gaming population (3.4% in this study) significantly exceeded the
whole population and characteristically showed more problems
than others. A further 15.2% of the population also showed
moderately elevated level of problems. One of the most important
tasks in future research is the detailed analysis of this at-risk
population and to explore which background factors may carry
high risk concerning problematic gaming. For forthcoming studies,
the results here highlight two significant dimensions, withdrawal
and social isolation, that showed elevated levels in case of these
gamers, while obsession and overuse seemed to be the less
indicative dimensions. Therefore, it seems that intensive actual
(overuse) or imaginary (obsessive) gaming is less indicative of
problematic gaming in itself. These results coincide with the results
observed concerning problematic internet use . In contrast,
neglecting social relationships and especially the presence of
withdrawal symptoms (feeling depressed or irritable, getting
restless, anxious or upset when not able to game) appear to carry
the highest risks. Furthermore, it is important to note that both
dimensions include reducing or neglecting other activities which
are key characteristics of addictions according to the results of
many other studies.
One limitation of the present study is that it was carried out
among Hungarian gamers thus results should be cautiously
generalized for other cultures. However, it is hoped that future
studies can confirm the findings presented here in other cultures.
Another important issue is that current results were based on selfreport data. It is again a challenge for future studies to investigate

those gamers that scored on POGQ below the average, while the second class represents the low risk, the third class represents medium risk of
