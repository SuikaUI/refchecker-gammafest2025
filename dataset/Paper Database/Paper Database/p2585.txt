lthough social and intellectual engagement have
been consistently associated with late-life functioning, rather than true causation, these associations
may reflect the experiential choices of high functioning
individuals (i.e., selection effects). We investigated the
association of social activity with late-life physical functioning, cognitive functioning, and depression
symptomatology using data from 1112 pairs of like-sex
twins who participated in the Longitudinal Study of
Aging Danish Twins. Consistent with previous
research, we found that social activity was significantly
correlated with overall level of physical functioning,
cognitive functioning, and depression symptomatology. We also found that social activity was significantly
and moderately heritable (estimate of .36), raising the
possibility that its association with late-life functioning
might reflect selection processes. Further, social activity did not predict change in functioning and in
monozygotic twin pairs discordant on level of social
activity, the more socially active twin was not less susceptible to age decreases in physical and cognitive
functioning and increases in depression symptomatology than the less socially active twin. These results are
interpreted in the context of the additional finding that
nonshared environmental factors, although apparently
not social activity, are the predominant determinant of
changes in late-life functioning.
The hypothesis that an active lifestyle is essential to
living a happy, healthy and long life is the basis for
public health recommendations , and is captured by the
popular maxim, ‘Use it or lose it’. Nonetheless,
although an active and engaged lifestyle undoubtedly contributes to physical, psychological and
cognitive health in late life, it has been difficult for
researchers to precisely quantify and characterize
the nature of this contribution. Several factors have
contributed to the difficulty of unambiguously
identifying the effect of an active lifestyle. The
association between activity and functioning, rather
than reflecting a direct causal influence, may owe
to their common correlation with other lifestyle
and medical risk factors. Individuals who are active
are also likely to not smoke, not be obese, be highly
educated, and have good access to health care
 .
Statistical adjustment for confounded effects is a
common, and we believe legitimate, approach to
trying to isolate the effect of a variable of interest
(e.g., estimating the association of physical activity
and late-life health controlling statistically for the
correlation of both with other lifestyle factors like
smoking and weight). Nonetheless, statistical
control alone cannot entirely resolve the issue of
causal ambiguity since a residual association could
always be accounted for by some unmeasured
covariate.
A related, and we believe more significant, issue
is what has been termed the ‘selection problem’ —
the possibility that the association between activity
and indicators of late-life functioning reflect the
lifestyle selections of genetically healthier individuals
 . For example, individuals
with an inherited disposition for high cognitive functioning may be more likely to engage in intellectual
pursuits than individuals without this inherited advantage simply because their genetic constitution makes
these activities easier and more enjoyable to engage in.
The selection problem, which is characterized as a
gene–environment correlation by behavioral geneticists, raises the possibility that the association of
lifestyle factors with late-life functioning may reflect
the causal influence of the latter on the former
rather than the converse.
Experimental interventions are the most direct way
of resolving the contribution of lifestyle factors to latelife functioning. Nonetheless, the effects of short-term
but intense lifestyle changes may not adequately capture
the long-term impact of lifestyle factors that play out
over the course of many years rather than just several
weeks. Alternatively, investigators have used prospective
longitudinal studies in an attempt to resolve causal
ambiguity. Because initial levels of functioning are
thought to capture the impact of selection effects, an

association between a lifestyle factor and change in functioning is considered supportive of true causation.
Nonetheless, lifestyle exposure may be heritable , so that its association
with initial level or change in functioning may be genetically rather than environmentally mediated.
Finally, the co-twin control approach attempts to
resolve causal ambiguity by determining whether lifestyle
differences between genetically identical individuals,
which must be environmental in origin, are associated
with differences in their functioning. Crowe et al. 
provide an illustration of the use of co-twin controls to
address the selection problem. Replicating previous
research, these investigators found that individuals who
develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) were less likely than
controls to have had an active lifestyle 20 years prior to
their clinical evaluation. But does the lower rate of activity seen in individuals who develop AD reflect a direct
causal influence of leisure activity on risk of AD, or
might reduced activity be an early consequence of the
cognitive deficiencies experienced by individuals who
develop AD, due perhaps to reduced cognitive reserve
 ? By showing further
that reduced activity differentiates cases from controls
within twin pairs discordant for developing AD, Crowe
et al. were able to conclude that genetic selection
effects could not account entirely for the observed association of activity with AD.
The present study uses the co-twin control method to
investigate the relationship of social activity with three
domains of late-life functioning: physical functioning,
cognitive functioning, and depression symptomatology.
We make use of a large sample of over 1000 pairs of likesex twin participants in the Longitudinal Study of Aging
Danish Twins to
address the following questions:
1. What is the nature of late-life age changes in physical functioning, cognitive functioning, depression
symptomatology, and social activity?
2. To what extent do genetic and environmental
factors contribute to initial status and change in
physical functioning, cognitive functioning, and
depression symptomatology?
3. How are the genetic and environmental contributions to initial status and change in physical
functioning, cognitive functioning, and depression
symptomatology related to social activity?
4. In monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs selected to be discordant for social activity, does the more active twin
show higher levels and reduced change in physical
functioning, cognitive functioning, and depression
symptomatology relative to the less active twin?
The sample is taken from participants in the LSADT, a
cohort sequential study of elderly Danish twins.
LSADT began in 1995 with an assessment of all

members of like-sex twin pairs born in Denmark before
1920 and thus at least 75 years old at the beginning of
1995. This initial cohort was followed up in 1997,
1999, 2001, 2003 and 2005. Additional cohorts were
added in 1997, 1999, and 2001 and subsequently followed at 2-year intervals. Figure 1 gives a schematic
representation of the number of participants across the
multiple waves of participation. Table 1 gives some
basic demographic characteristics of the sample. A total
of 4731 twins have completed an intake LSADT assessment. Twins were recruited to participate regardless of
whether their co-twin was alive. Consequently, many of
the participants in LSADT are ‘singleton twins’; the full
sample includes only 1152 pairs in which both
members completed an intake assessment. As can be
seen, rate of participation has been excellent over the
multiple waves of LSADT, with participation rates generally falling between 70% and 80%. A detailed
description of the LSADT sample as well as an analysis
of nonparticipants can be found in Christensen et al.
 .
The sample for the current study is based on likesex twins pairs in which both members participated in
LSADT. Among the 1152 participating pairs, zygosity
could not be determined for 19 pairs and 21 pairs were
dropped because they were opposite-sex dizygotic twin
pairs, a small number of which had been sampled in
LSADT. This left a sample of 1112 twin pairs: 175
monozygotic male (MZM), 246 dizygotic male (DZM),
276 monozygotic female (MZF), and 415 dizygotic
female (DZF).
Participants were usually assessed in their homes by
one of approximately 100 interviewers. The interviewers were employed by the Danish National Institute of
Social Research, which has extensive experience in
assessing elderly Danes . Interviewers completed a detailed training
program 2 months prior to each survey initiation and
were closely monitored during the survey period. Many
of the interviewers participated in multiple LSADT
waves. To minimize bias, the two members of a twin
pair were always assessed by different interviewers.
Interviews typically lasted approximately 75 minutes
and included assessment of demographic background,
medical and physical health, depression symptomatology and cognitive testing.
The current study uses standard measures of physical,
cognitive and emotional functioning that have been
used in several previous LSADT studies as well as a
measure of social activity, which is introduced in the
present study.
Physical functioning. Our self-reported assessment of
physical functioning is based on an adaptation of an
instrument that was developed and previously validated
in Denmark and has been administered essentially unchanged throughout LSADT. Here
we use the Strength scale, which consists of 11 items
(e.g., walk up two flights of stairs) each responded to
 Published online by Cambridge University Press
on a 1 to 4 scale (1 = cannot do, 2 = do with aid or
major difficulties, 3 = do with fatigue or minor difficulties, 4 = do without aid or difficulty). The Strength
scale is the average of the 11 individual responses. The
Strength scale has high internal consistency and reliability (> .90) and is relatively stable (two-year stability is
generally .60 or greater).
Cognitive functioning. The cognitive battery includes
the Mini Mental State Examination , and five brief cognitive tests selected to be
sensitive to age-related changes . The MMSE is a standard neurological screen
that is especially effective for screening at the low end
of cognitive functioning. In our sample, the MMSE is
both internally consistent (.75) and temporally stable
(2-year stability r = .64). The brief cognitive tests
include a verbal fluency task (categories, the number of
animals named in 1 minute), forward and backward
digit span, and immediate and delayed recall of a 12item list. The five individual cognitive measures are

Participation in the multiple waves of the LSADT. The LSADT used a cohort-sequential design, with new cohorts recruited to participate at the
initial wave in 1995 and at subsequent waves in 1997, 1999, and 2001. New cohorts were not recruited after 2001 to ensure that all cohorts had
completed at least three waves of assessment by the end of the study in 2005.

temporally stable (2-year stability coefficients range from
.40 to .52) and positively correlated, the latter justifying
the formation of a composite of the five tests (which has
an internal consistency reliability estimate of .75 and a
2-year stability coefficient of .60).
Depression symptomatology. Our assessment of
depression symptomatology is based on an adaptation of
the depression section of the Cambridge Mental
Disorders of the Elderly Examination . The Depression scale used here is a composite of responses to 17 depression items and is
described more fully in McGue and Christensen .
The scale has high internal consistency reliability (.83)
and is moderately stable over a two-year period (.64).
Social activity. The Social Activity scale is based on six
items that assess the frequency with which the individual
is engaged with others (e.g., how often do you leave
your home, how often do you go to a party) and mental
pursuits (e.g., how often to you engage in a hobby).
Each item is rated on a 1 (Never) to 4 (5–7 days a week)
scale. The composite scale is moderately internally consistent (.51) but quite stable over a 2-year interval (r =
.88). Because the Social Activity scale was not administered in LSADT until 1997, all analyses reported on here
are based on the 1997 and subsequent assessments.
Four different types of analyses were undertaken to
investigate the relationship of social activity with
late-life functioning. First, growth curve models were
fit to each of the four outcome variables as well as
Social Activity. These analyses were undertaken using
SAS Proc Mixed to account for the clustered structure
of the data. The growth curve analyses allowed us to
describe how each of the variables we are investigating
was associated with age and thus provided a foundation for all subsequent analyses.
Second, biometric growth curve models were fit to
each of the four outcome variables, Strength,
Depression, MMSE, and the Cognitive Composite,
using the methods described by Neale and McArdle
 . In the biometric growth curve model, a
schematic representation of which is given in Figure 2,
the variance of an observed score at any wave is
modeled as a function of an overall level effect (L), a
rate-of-change or slope effect (S), and wave-specific
residual effects. Using standard biometric assumptions, the slope, level and residual effects can be
furthered decomposed into additive genetic (A),
shared environmental (C) and nonshared environmental (E) components. Although in principle we could
model biometric contributions to quadratic and higher
order moments of change given that we had up to five
waves of data, we elected to include only a linear term
because only a small proportion of our sample had
three or four data points and it is difficult to reliably
assess individual differences in higher order moments
with this number of observations .

The biometric growth curve model. For ease of presentation, the model depicts phenotypic assessments (Pi) on up to four waves of assessment
(i = 1, 4) rather than the full six waves in LSADT. Underlying the individual phenotypic scores at each wave is an initial value or level (L) effect, a
linear rate-of-change or slope (S) effect, and wave-specific residual effects. L, S and the residuals are each in turn decomposed into underlying
additive genetic (A), shared environmental (C), and nonshared environmental (E) effects.

Third, we fit an additional series of biometric
growth models in which the initial assessment on Social
Activity was included as a covariate. These models
allowed us to investigate the correlation of initial level
of Social Activity with initial level and change in each
of the four outcomes, and to estimate the genetic and
environmental contributions to these correlations.
Finally as a supplement to the expanded biometric
growth curve analyses, we identified a set of MZ twins
discordant on initial level of Social Activity and investigated whether these twins also differed on initial level
and change in each of the four outcomes.
Individual Growth Curve Analysis
An individual-level growth curve model was fit to
each of the five variables using SAS Proc Mixed.
Independent variables included age, squared age, sex,
and the interactions of sex with age and age squared.
In all cases the age main effect was statistically significant at p < .01, and the quadratic age effect was
significant for all variables except Depression. The sex
main effect was significant for all variables except the
two cognitive outcomes, MMSE and the Cognitive
Composite, but none of the interactions of sex with
age and squared age were statistically significant.
Figure 3 gives the fitted group mean growth curves for
females (Figure 3a) and males (Figure 3b). To facilitate
interpretation, each of the five variables was scaled to
have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of
10 (i.e., a T-score metric) in the overall sample. As is
evident from the graphs, the average change in functioning over the age range spanned by LSADT
(approximately age 70 to 100) is substantial for both
Strength and MMSE (somewhat greater than a 3 SD
decline) and moderate for both the Cognitive
Composite (a 2 SD decline) and Depression (a 1.5 SD
increase). Interestingly, Social Activity is also significantly, albeit more modestly, associated with age,
declining by a little over 1 SD on average between age
70 and 100.
Biometric Growth Curve Analysis
The biometric growth curve model described by Neale
and McArdle and depicted in Figure 2 was fit
to each of the four outcome variables using the Mx
software system . To account for
the cohort-sequential nature of the LSADT design,
which resulted in a varying number of observations on
study participants, models were fit to the raw data
under the assumption that data were missing at
random . Only the full growth
model (i.e., A, C and E effects on level, slope and the
residuals) was fit for each variable. Submodels were
not fit because in this initial biometric analysis we
wanted to assess the contribution of all potential

sources of variance, recognizing that the statistical
power for some of the parameters in the model may be
limited . As an alternative to
formal hypothesis testing, we provide confidence intervals for the standardized variance component estimates
in Table 2. For all four outcomes, the genetic contribution to individual differences in initial value (i.e., the
intercept) was moderate and statistically significant
(i.e., as judged by the confidence interval not including
0). Estimates of shared environmental effects on initial
level of functioning were effectively zero for Strength
and Depression but moderate and statistically significant for both of the cognitive measures. Nonshared
environmental effects accounted for at least half of the
variance in initial level of functioning for all outcomes
except the Cognitive Composite, where it accounted for
approximately a third of the variance.
The pattern of standardized variance component
estimates for the slope (change) scores is quite different
from that for the intercept scores. Heritability estimates
are uniformly small, and in only one case, for Strength,
was the estimate statistically significant. Similarly, there
is little evidence for shared environmental contributions
to change in functioning – none of the shared environmental variance estimates was statistically significant.
The major source of individual differences in change is
nonshared environmental factors, which accounted for
between 69% (Depression) and 82% (Strength) of the
variance in change.
Relationship of Social Activity to Late-Life Functioning
The biometric growth model depicted in Figure 2 was
expanded to include intake Social Activity as a covariate and refit to each of the four outcome variables. The
aim of these analyses was to estimate the contribution
of Social Activity to both initial level and change in
each of the four outcome variables and to determine the
extent to which the association between Social Activity
and late-life functioning was attributable to common
genetic and common environmental factors. Before
fitting these models, the standard univariate ACE
model was fit to the intake Social Activity scores. The
standardized variance component estimates (95% confidence intervals) from this model were: a
2 = .36 (.21,
2 = .00 (.00, .11); and e
2 = .64 (.56, .72). Because
the shared environmental contribution to variance in
Social Activity was estimated to be 0.0, this parameter
was fixed to 0.0 when fitting the extended growth
models. Shared environmental parameters were also
fixed to 0.0 for Strength and Depression, since estimates of these parameters were near zero in the initial
growth model analyses, but not fixed to 0.0 for MMSE
and the Cognitive Composite, where the initial growth
curve analyses provided evidence for shared environmental effects.
Parameter estimates describing the association of
Social Activity with late-life functioning along with
their associated confidence intervals are given in
Table 3. At the phenotypic level, the correlation
between activity and initial level of functioning was in
every case statistically significant. The magnitude of
this correlation in absolute value ranged from .21 for
MMSE to .53 for Strength. Thus, individuals who were
highly engaged socially were physically and cognitively
more able and less likely to experience symptoms of
depression than individuals with low levels of social
engagement. Social Activity was, however, only modestly associated with change in functioning. The
phenotypic correlation between Social Activity and the
slope was near-zero and nonsignificant for both of the
cognitive measures, and modest (r = .18) but significant
for Strength. This correlation was also significant for
the Depression slope (r = .22), although in this case the
direction of correlation is counterintuitive, with rate of
increase in depression being greatest among the most
socially engaged individuals.
Also given in the table is the proportion of each phenotypic correlation attributable to genetic factors. Since
we did not include common shared environmental
effects in the model because the shared environmental

metric (i.e., mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10) in the overall
sample to ease interpretation of the magnitude of the age effects. The
High Activity twin scored at least 1.5 standard deviations higher than
the low activity twin on our measure of Social Activity. There is a significant twin difference in initial value but not change. The discordant

effect was estimated to be zero in our univariate analysis
of the Social Activity scores, the proportion of the phenotypic correlation attributable to nonshared
environmental factors is simply the complement of the
proportion attributed to genetic factors. Genetic factors
accounted for a majority of the correlation between
Social Activity and each of the intercepts and essentially
accounted for the entire correlation between Social
Activity and each of the slopes.
Co-Twin Control Analysis of Social Activity
Our final analysis involved a discordant MZ twin
analysis of the relationship between Social Activity
and the four late-life functioning measures. Among the
356 MZ twin pairs where both members had completed the Social Activity scale at intake, we identified
those whose Social Activity scores differed by at least
1.5 SDs. While the decision to use a threshold of 1.5
SDs is admittedly arbitrary, it did provide a large
enough sample of discordant MZ twins (N = 70) to
produce statistically reliable results. The sample of discordant MZ twins was 63% female and had an
average (SD) age of 75.7 (5.2) at the time they completed the Social Activity measure. For each of the
four outcomes, the discordant twin sample was analyzed using individual growth curve analysis using SAS
Proc Mixed. In these analyses, the independent variables were sex, age, squared age, Social Activity level
(i.e., the high vs. the low scoring twin) and the interaction of Social Activity with age. The Social Activity
main effect was significant for Strength,
F(1,69) = 61.1; p < .001, Depression, F(1,69) = 9.5;
p < .01, and the Cognitive Composite, F(1,68) = 14.1;
p < .001; but not for MMSE, F(1,69) = .42; p > .25. In
no case was the interaction of Social Activity by age
statistically significant (all ps > .10). Figure 4 illustrates for one of the outcomes, strength, the nature of
the co-twin control growth model results.
Discussion
Summary of Results
Our analysis of late-life functioning in a large longitudinal study of older Danish twins led to the following
findings: (1) over the age range spanned by LSADT,
we observed significant and substantial declines in
physical and cognitive functioning and increases in
depression symptomatology, (2) while genetic factors
contributed significantly to initial levels of physical
and cognitive functioning and depression symptomatology, change in these measures was attributed
overwhelmingly to the effect of nonshared environmental factors, (3) our measure of social activity was
in part heritable and predictive of initial level of physical and cognitive functioning and depression but was
largely uncorrelated with change in late-life functioning; and (4) MZ twins discordant for level of social
activity differed in initial level but not in change in
physical and cognitive functioning and depression. We
discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the nature of late-life functioning and the
influence of social activity on that functioning.
The Nature of Late-Life Functioning in Physical and Cognitive
Functioning and Depression
Our individual growth curve analyses confirm earlier
research showing that on average physical functioning
 and cognitive functioning
 decline while depression symptomatology 
increases with age. Perhaps most notable in these
analyses is the magnitude of the age-related change,
estimated to be approximately a 3 SD decline in physical functioning, a 2 SD decline in cognitive
functioning, and a 1.5 SD increase in depression
symptomatology score between age 70 and 100.
The biometric extension of the individual-growth
curve analyses allowed us to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to late-life functioning and
change. Consistent with previous research
 , we found moderate and
significant genetic effects on overall level of physical
functioning (a
2 = .39), cognitive functioning (a
for MMSE and .39 for the Cognitive Composite), and
depression symptomatology (a
2 = .50). Because the

growth curve analysis allowed us to partial out the
effects of time-specific measurement error, these heritability estimates are somewhat greater than those for
similar measures but based on a single assessment in
older populations. Nonetheless, the overall strength of
genetic contributions to individual differences in each
of the three major domains of late-life functioning we
investigated is at best moderate. Clearly environmental factors play a very important role.
This conclusion gains further support from our
biometric analysis of change. In every case, the heritability of change in functioning (as reflected by the
slope) was estimated to be small. The estimated heritability for the slope was .12 for MMSE, .18 for the
Cognitive Composite, and .06 for Depression, all nonsignificant values. Moreover, although the heritability
for change in Strength was statistically significant, the
estimate (a
2 = .14) was also modest. Our results are
thus consistent with earlier studies in indicating that
nonshared environmental factors are the major contributors to linear change in late-life functioning.
Worth noting is that in the biometric growth model
measurement error, which typically is apportioned to
the estimate of nonshared environment, is included in
the residual terms. Consequently, our finding of strong
nonshared environmental effects on the slope is not
attributable to the unreliability of measurement.
The Role of Social Activity in Late-Life Functioning
Epidemiologists have repeatedly shown that individuals who are socially and intellectually engaged in late
life are more likely to be physically and cognitively fit and are less susceptible to depression
 than those who experience relatively low levels of social and intellectual stimulation.
Our findings confirm the existence of these associations. Our measure of Social Activity correlated
significantly and moderately with all four of our outcomes. Specifically, in growth curve analyses we found
that Social Activity correlated .53 with initial value for
Strength, –.38 with initial Depression, .21 with initial
MMSE, and .44 with initial Cognitive Composite.
Although the association of social activity with latelife functioning has often been interpreted to reflect a
causal influence of the former on the latter, selection
effects cannot be ruled out. That is, it is possible that
the association arises because high functioning individuals are more likely to be socially and intellectually
active in late life than low functioning individuals.
Our finding that Social Activity is significantly and
moderately heritable (a
2 = .36) supports the possibility
of selection effects. Selection effects were further
implicated by our finding that the association of Social
Activity with initial level of functioning was in every
case primarily genetically mediated. Specifically, the
proportion of the phenotypic correlation between
Social Activity and initial level of functioning
attributable to genetic effects ranged from .50 for
Strength to .78 for the Cognitive Composite.
Two sets of analyses were undertaken in an attempt
to rule out the possibility that selection effects could
account entirely for the association of Social Activity
and late-life functioning in our sample. First, for each
outcome we determined whether initial levels of Social
Activity predicted change in functioning. The correlation between Social Activity and change in cognitive
functioning was near-zero for both MMSE (r = .03) and
the Cognitive Composite (r = –.02). For Depression the
correlation between Social Activity and change was
opposite in sign to what would we expected (i.e., we
found greatest increases in depression among those
with highest initial levels of social activity), and consequently likely to be a statistical anomaly. Only for
Strength did we find a significant association between
Social Activity and change, although even here the correlation was only modest in magnitude (r = .18). Our
longitudinal analyses thus do not support a strong
causal contribution of Social Activity.
Our co-twin control analysis also do not support
the existence of a strong causal influence of social
activity on late-life functioning. We identified 70 pairs
of MZ twins whose Social Activity scores differed by
at least 1.5 SDs. Consistent with our finding of significant correlations between Social Activity and initial
levels of functioning in the growth curve analyses, the
more socially active twin scored significantly higher in
Strength and on the Cognitive Composite and significantly lower on Depression than the less socially
active twin. The difference for MMSE was in the same
direction but not statistically significant. Thus there
are environmental contributions to the association
between late-life functioning and social activity,
although the existence of these common environmental effects does not rule out selection processes. Most
critical is whether the discordant MZ twins differed in
change in functioning over time. In this regard our
findings are unambiguous — we found no evidence
that the more socially active twin was less susceptible
to age-related changes in physical functioning, cognitive functioning, and depression symptomatology than
the less socially active twin.
Our failure to find evidence that social activity
contributes to change in late-life functioning is somewhat surprising in light of findings from the biometric
growth curve analyses. These analyses showed that
nonshared environmental factors were the major
source of change in the outcomes we investigated, and
review of recent gerontological research would likely
lead to the conclusion that social engagement is a
prime candidate underlying that change. Moreover,
univariate analysis of our social activity measure
revealed that approximately two-thirds of the variance
in this measure was associated with nonshared environmental factors. Nonetheless, social activity
accounted for little of the nonshared environmental
effects on initial levels of functioning and essentially

none of the nonshared variance in change in functioning. If not social activity, then what are the factors
that account for the substantial nonshared environmental influences our analyses imply exist? We favor
two alternative hypotheses. First, individual differences
in age-related change may be largely stochastic and
idiosyncratic. In their review of the literature at earlier
developmental stages, Turkheimer and Waldron 
concluded that there was little evidence that nonshared
environmental influences on behavior were systematic,
a scenario characterized as ‘gloomy’ since it implies that
major environmental influences will not be identified
because they do not exist .
Second, our failure may stem from the nature of our
environmental assessment. Our social activity measure
was based on a single assessment in late life. An understanding of environmental contributions to late-life
functioning may, however, require a broader developmental perspective. In particular, since the habits and
attitudes established earlier in life may have profound
effects on late-life functioning, we hypothesize that
experiences in mid-life may be more critical to understanding aging than those in late life. Although it
provides only weak support, our finding that social
activity effects are associated primarily with initial level
of functioning is consistent with this hypothesis.
Limitations
The results reported herein should be interpreted in
the context of three research limitations. First, our
measure of Social Activity consists of only six items,
and could not possibly therefore cover the full range
of social and intellectual experience that exists in late
life. We also did not assess social support or positive
social engagement, which may be key to understanding social effects on late-life functioning. Better
measures than ours could yield different results.
Nonetheless, it is perhaps worth noting that despite its
limitations our measure of social activity was significantly related to initial level of functioning in all the
domains investigated; it was just not associated with
change in either the growth curve or discordant twin
pair analyses. Second, our sample is based in
Denmark, a small and relatively ethnically homogeneous country. The nature of aging in a country like
Denmark, where access to medical care is universal
and poverty rates are low, may differ from that in
other regions of the world. Third, the nature of social
activity may be different for twins than for nontwins
because a twin has someone he or she has shared a
lifetime with. While we acknowledge that twin
research on social activity may not fully generalize to
nontwins, we do note that there is no evidence that
twins age differently or have different mortality rates
than nontwins . Finally, in
our biometric growth curve analyses we defined the
phenotypes by the wave of assessment (e.g., intake,
first follow-up) rather than the age at assessment (e.g.,
functioning at age 77, 79). The latter, age-basis
approach, would have accounted for age differences
among participants at any given assessment. Failure to
take age into account may have resulted in an overestimation of shared environmental effects .
Conclusion
Analysis of a large longitudinal sample of older
Danish twins showed that while social activity was
significantly associated with initial levels of physical
functioning, cognitive functioning, and depression
symptomatology, it did not predict change in these
variables. Moreover, an analysis of MZ twins discordant for level of social activity found that the highly
active twin was not less susceptible to age-related
declines in physical functioning and cognitive functioning and increases in depression symptomatology.
Consequently, these analyses suggest that the association of social activity and late-life functioning largely
reflect selection effects rather than true causation.
Nonetheless, the major contributor to change in latelife functioning is nonshared environmental factors,
the specific nature of which remains to be determined.
