Background
Current cancer care increasingly incorporates psychosocial interventions. Cancer patients use dance/movement therapy to learn to accept
and reconnect with their bodies, build new self-confidence, enhance self-expression, address feelings of isolation, depression, anger and
fear and to strengthen personal resources.
Objectives
To update the previously published review that examined the eﬀects of dance/movement therapy and standard care versus standard care
alone or standard care and other interventions on psychological and physical outcomes in patients with cancer.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) , MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , PsycINFO , LILACS , Science Citation Index , CancerLit , International Bibliography of Theatre and Dance , the National Research Register ,
Proquest Digital Dissertations, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Current Controlled Trials . We handsearched dance/movement
therapy and related topics journals, reviewed reference lists and contacted experts. There was no language restriction.
Selection criteria
We included all randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of dance/movement therapy interventions for improving psychological
and physical outcomes in patients with cancer. We considered studies only if dance/movement therapy was provided by a formally trained
dance/movement therapist or by trainees in a formal dance/movement therapy program.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed the methodological quality, seeking additional information from the
trial researchers when necessary. Results were presented using standardized mean diﬀerences.
Main results
We identified one new trial for inclusion in this update. In total, the evidence for this review rests on three studies with a total of 207
participants.
We found no evidence for an eﬀect of dance/movement therapy on depression (standardized mean diﬀerence (SMD) = 0.02, 95% confidence
interval (CI) -0.28 to 0.32, P = 0.89, I2 = 0%) (two studies, N = 170), stress (SMD = -0.18, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.12, P = 0.24, I2 = 0%) (two studies,

N = 170), anxiety (SMD = 0.21, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.51 P = 0.18, I2 = 0%) (two studies, N = 170), fatigue (SMD = -0.36, 95% -1.26 to 0.55, P = 0.44,
I2 = 80%) (two studies, N = 170) and body image (SMD = -0.13, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.34, P = 0.58, I2 = 0%) (two studies, N = 68) in women with
breast cancer. The data of one study with moderate risk of bias suggested that dance/movement therapy had a large beneficial eﬀect on
37 participants' quality of life (QoL) (SMD = 0.89, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.57). One study with a high risk of bias reported greater improvements in
vigor and greater reduction in somatization in the dance/movement therapy group compared to a standard care control group (N = 31). The
individual studies did not find support for an eﬀect of dance/movement therapy on mood, mental health, and pain. It is unclear whether
this was due to ineﬀectiveness of the treatment, inappropriate outcome measures or limited power of the trials. Finally, the results of
one study did not find evidence for an eﬀect of dance/movement therapy on shoulder range of motion (ROM) or arm circumference in 37
women who underwent a lumpectomy or breast surgery. However, this was likely due to large within-group variability for shoulder ROM
and a limited number of participants with lymphedema.
Two studies presented moderate risk of bias and one study high risk of bias. Therefore, overall, the quality of the evidence is very low.
Authors' conclusions
We did not find support for an eﬀect of dance/movement therapy on depression, stress, anxiety, fatigue and body image. The findings
of individual studies suggest that dance/movement therapy may have a beneficial eﬀect on QoL, somatization, and vigor. However, the
limited number of studies prevents us from drawing conclusions concerning the eﬀects of dance/movement therapy on psychological and
physical outcomes in cancer patients.

Dance/movement therapy for cancer patients
Cancer may result in extensive emotional, physical and social suﬀering. Current cancer care increasingly incorporates psychosocial
interventions to improve quality of life. Creative arts therapies such as dance/movement, music, art and drama therapy have been used
to aid care and recovery. Following medical therapies, which can be invasive, people with cancer use dance/movement therapy to learn
to accept and reconnect with their bodies, build new self-confidence, enhance self-expression, address feelings of isolation, depression,
anger, fear and distrust and strengthen personal resources. It has also been used to improve range of arm motion and to reduce arm
circumference afer mastectomy or lumpectomy. For this review, studies were considered only if dance/movement therapy was provided
by a formally trained dance/movement therapist or by trainees in a formal program.
The aim of the review
This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 2011, which included two studies which did not find support for an eﬀect
of dance/movement therapy on body image, the only common outcome between the two studies. The aim was to examine the impact of
dance/movement therapy on psychological and physical outcomes in people with cancer.
For this review update, we searched for additional trials on the eﬀect of dance/movement therapy on psychological and physical outcomes
in people with cancer. We searched for published and ongoing studies up toJuly 2014. We considered all studies in which dance/movement
therapy was compared with any form of standard treatment.
What are the main findings?
We identified one new study for this update. The three studies included a a total of 207 participants, which were women with breast cancer.
The studies were small in size. We found no evidence of an eﬀect for depression, stress, anxiety, fatigue, and body image. The findings
of individual studies suggest that dance/movement therapy may have a beneficial eﬀect on the quality of life, somatization (i.e. distress
arising from perceptions of bodily dysfunction) and vigor of women with breast cancer. No adverse eﬀects of dance/movement therapy
interventions were reported.
Quality of the evidence
The evidence is based on only three small studies and the quality of the evidence is not strong.
What are the conclusions?
No conclusions could be drawn regarding the eﬀect of dance/movement therapy on psychological and physical outcomes in cancer
patients because of an insuﬀicient number of studies. More research is needed. We did not identify any conflicts of interests in the included

Description of the condition
Having cancer may result in extensive emotional, physical
and social suﬀering. Study findings indicate that cancer
patients experience elevated levels of psychological distress
 and depression
 in response to diagnosis and
treatment. Therefore, current cancer care increasingly incorporates
psychosocial interventions to help patients come to terms with
changes in their body, address distorted body images, deal with
unresolved grief, restore hope, increase emotional expression,
reduce isolation and improve self-esteem. Research results have
indicated that such comprehensive care has improved cancer
patients' quality of life (QoL) .
Description of the intervention
Creative arts therapies such as dance/movement, music, art and
drama therapy have been used to aid in the care of cancer patients
and in their recovery. Following medical therapies, which can be
invasive, cancer patients use dance/movement therapy to learn to
accept and reconnect with their bodies, build new self-confidence,
enhance self-expression, address feelings of isolation, depression,
anger, fear and distrust and strengthen personal resources . It is assumed that when physical
changes in the body are a source of pain and distress, that a bodyfocused approach to psychosocial support can have a meaningful
impact . Dance/movement therapy has also been
used to improve range of arm motion and shoulder function and
to reduce arm circumference afer mastectomy or lumpectomy, to
decrease pain and fatigue and to improve vitality .
As defined by the American Dance Therapy Association, "Dance/
movement therapy is the psychotherapeutic use of movement
as a process which furthers the emotional, social, cognitive and
physical integration of the individual" (ADTA). Dance/movement
therapy may include a variety of dance/movement methods and is
characterized by a goal-oriented, systematic treatment process. For
this review, we considered studies only if dance/movement therapy
was provided by a formally trained dance/movement therapist or
by trainees in a formal dance/movement therapy program.
How the intervention might work
Dance/movement therapy promotes individuals’ spontaneous
movement expression, which allows them to enact thoughts
and feelings that are ofen diﬀicult to articulate in words. This
experience not only creates an outlet through which emotions
and psychological tension can be discharged, but also provides
a vehicle for becoming aware of personal strengths and inner
resources . The process of enactment, combined with
the use of aﬀirmative images and symbols, enables individuals
to reinforce healthy parts of themselves as well as activate
motivation for positive change. This, in turn, can result in enhanced
self-eﬀicacy . Self-eﬀicacy is a significant predictor
for higher level of illness adaptation, symptom management
and quality of life in cancer patients . Attentive self-awareness may furthermore lead
to valuing one’s own body, and this may contribute to better
self-care behaviors .The process of intentional
embodiment, which is at the core of dance/movement therapy
interventions, means that new experiences become analogous
to active practicing. Thus, what is learnt in the session (e.g.,
new behaviors, interpersonal skills, expressive abilities, or aﬀect
regulation) is more likely to be mastered and generalized to
contexts outside the therapy session.
In addition to facilitating expression of emotions and thoughts,
dance/movement therapy encourages individuals to enhance
awareness of their own body, as well as explore their perceptions of
self and others in the interpersonal environment .
Dance/movement therapy can help cancer patients to restore a
positive relationship with themselves and to develop a healthy
body image by promoting a realistic understanding of the shape
and function of their body; instilling a sense of acceptance about
the changes their body might have gone through in the course of
treatment; and helping them to restore the vital connection to their
body .
Finally, a number of interacting factors contribute to the capacity
for dance/movement therapy to improve mood state, and reduce
self-reported depression and anxiety .
In practice, dance/movement therapy combines the benefits of
mobility and mild exercise with interpersonal/social support
and the creative/expressive process. Independently, each of
these components has mood-elevating properties: expression
of emotions, as opposed to the constraint of that expression,
can lead to better health outcomes , and social
support provides a context for that expression. Dance and dance/
movement therapy both have been shown to bring about a sense
of vitality . This is partially through the
use of rhythmic action, which discharges and releases muscular
tension. It may be this same combination of curative factors in
dance/movement therapy that leads to stress reduction, as was
demonstrated and discussed in a randomized controlled trial with
162 participants . Neurohormonal changes may
also play a role in the mood-elevating eﬀect of dance/movement
therapy .
Why it is important to do this review
Several research studies on the use of dance/movement therapy
with cancer patients have reported positive results . The majority of
these studies, however, are small and lack statistical power. In
addition, diﬀerences in factors such as study designs, methods
of interventions and type and intensity of treatment have led to
varying results. A systematic review is needed to more accurately
gauge the eﬀicacy of dance/movement interventions for cancer
patients as well as to identify variables that may moderate its

For this update, the search results for the databases were extended
from 2011 to 2014 between July 1 and July 15 2014.
Searching other resources
We handsearched the following journals from first available date.
For this update, the journals were handsearched from January 2011
until July 2014.
American Journal of Dance Therapy

In an eﬀort to identify further published, unpublished and
ongoing trials, we searched the bibliographies of relevant studies
and reviews, contacted experts in the field and searched
available proceedings of dance/movement therapy conferences
(e.g. Congress of Research in Dance). We consulted international
dance/movement therapy association websites to help identify
relevant research studies as well as dance/movement therapy
practitioners and conference information. In addition, we posted
a message on the listservs of the American Dance Therapy
Association and the German Dance Therapy Association asking
members to inform us about published and unpublished research
that meets the inclusion criteria. Finally, we searched library
catalogues of American Universities that oﬀer dance/movement
therapy training programs for relevant theses.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
One review author (JB) conducted the searches as outlined in
the search strategy. The same review author (JB) and two dance/
movement therapy research assistants scanned titles and abstracts
of each record retrieved from the search and deleted obviously
irrelevant references. When a title/abstract could not be rejected
with certainty, two review authors (JB and SG) independently
inspected the full-text article. We used an inclusion criteria form to
assess the trial's eligibility for inclusion. Agreement was reached
on all inclusion decisions. In case of disagreement, we would have
sought the input of the third author (MS). If a trial appeared eligible

but was excluded afer inspection of the full text, we kept a record
of both the article and the reason for exclusion.
Data extraction and management
One review author (JB) and a research assistant independently
extracted data from the selected trials using a standardized coding
form (Appendix 14). We encountered some issues with data
extraction for one study . We sought the advice
of a statistician, sought input of another review author (SG) and
requested additional information from the chief investigator.
We extracted the following data.

Inclusion criteria
We extracted pre-test means, post-test means, standard deviations
and sample sizes for the treatment group and the control group for
the following outcomes (if applicable).
1. Psychological outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, anger,
hopelessness, helplessness, mood, self-esteem).
2. Symptom relief (e.g., fatigue, nausea, pain).
3. Physical outcomes (e.g., physical health, vitality, range of
motion, arm circumference).
4. Physiological outcomes (e.g., Immunoglobulin A levels, cortisol
5. Relationship and social support (e.g., family support, social
activity, isolation).
6. Communication (e.g., verbalization, facial aﬀect, gestures).
8. Body image.
9. Survival.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (JB and SG) assessed risk of bias, blinded to
each other's assessment for trial quality of all included trials. Any
disagreements were resolved by discussion. The review authors
used the following criteria for assessment of risk of bias.
Random sequence generation
Unclear risk
We rated random sequence generation as low risk if every
participant had an equal chance to be selected for either treatment
and if the investigator was unable to predict to which treatment
the participant would be assigned. Use of date of birth, date of
admission or alternation resulted in high risk of bias.
Allocation concealment
Low risk - methods to conceal allocation include:
central randomization
serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes
other descriptions with convincing concealment
Unclear risk - authors did not adequately report on method of
concealment
High risk (e.g. alternation methods were used)
Blinding of participants and personnel
Unclear risk
Blinding of participants is ofen not feasible in dance/movement
therapy studies unless a comparative design is used.
Blinding of outcome assessors
Low risk: outcome assessors were blinded
Unclear risk: authors did not adequately report on method of
High risk: (a) outcome assessors were not blinded or (b) selfreport measures were used and participants were not blinded
Incomplete outcome data
We recorded the proportion of participants whose outcomes were
analyzed. We coded loss to follow-up for each outcome.
Low risk: if fewer than 20% of patients were lost to follow-up and
reasons for loss to follow-up were similar in both treatment arms
Unclear risk: if loss to follow-up was not reported
High risk: if more than 20% of patients were lost to follow-up or
reasons for loss to follow-up diﬀered between treatment arms

Selective reporting
Low risk: reports of the study were free of suggestion of selective
outcome reporting
Unclear risk
High risk: reports of the study suggest selective outcome
Other sources of bias
Low risk: unlikely that other sources of bias influenced the
Unclear risk: unclear if other sources of bias may have influenced
the results
High risk: likely that other sources of bias influenced the results
We considered information on potential financial conflicts of
interest as a possible source of additional bias.
We used the above criteria to give each article an overall quality
rating )
A. Low risk of bias - all criteria met.
B. Moderate risk of bias - one or more of the criteria only partly met.
C. High risk of bias - one or more criteria not met.
We did not exclude studies based on a low quality score.
Dealing with missing data
We did not impute missing outcome data. We analyzed data on
an endpoint basis, including only participants for whom a final
data point measurement was obtained (available-case analysis).
It was not assumed that participants who dropped out afer
randomization had a negative outcome.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We investigated heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest
plots as well as using the I2 statistic, with an I2 greater than 50%
indicating significant heterogeneity.
Assessment of reporting biases
There were an insuﬀicient number of trials to assess reporting
biases. We had planned to compute funnel plots corresponding to
meta-analysis of the primary outcome to assess the potential for
small-study eﬀects such as publication bias.
Data synthesis
We entered data from the three trials included in this systematic
review into Review Manager (Revman 5.3). These studies had
five continuous variables in common. We calculated standardized
mean diﬀerences (SMD) for these outcomes because the results
were derived from diﬀerent scales. We calculated a pooled estimate
using the fixed-eﬀect model. In cases of significant heterogeneity,
we used the random-eﬀects model. We determined the levels of
heterogeneity by using the I2 statistic . We used a
random-eﬀects model when the I2 value was more than 50%. We
calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the eﬀect-size estimate.
For the other outcomes, we were limited to providing a narrative
description of the results of individual trials.
We made the following treatment comparison.
Dance/movement therapy versus standard care alone.
We had planned to include the following additional treatment
comparison but the three studies included in this review did not
allow for such analysis.
Dance/movement therapy interventions versus other therapies.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We had determined a priori to perform subgroup analyses by (a)
type of dance/movement therapy intervention and (b) stage of
illness. However, these subgroup analyses could not be performed
because of insuﬀicient numbers of studies. Subgroup analyses
would have been conducted as described by Deeks et al as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions, section 9.6 .
Sensitivity analysis
We had planned to examine the impact of sequence generation
by comparing the results of including and excluding studies that
used inadequate or unclear randomization methods. This was not
possible because only three studies were included in this review.

Results of the search
For the original review, the database searches and handsearching
of journals, conference proceedings and reference lists resulted
in 770 unique citations. One review author (JB) and a research
assistant examined the titles and abstracts and identified 15 studies
as potentially relevant, which we retrieved for further assessment.
These were then independently screened by the same review
author (JB) and a research assistant. Another review author (SG)
was consulted where needed.
We included three references reporting on two trials in this review
 . Where necessary, we contacted
the chief investigators to obtain additional information on study
details and data.
The 2014 update of the search resulted in 687 extra citations. One
review author (JB) and two research assistants examined the titles
and abstracts and retrieved full-text articles where necessary. The
two other reviewer authors (SG and MS) were consulted where
needed. This resulted in the addition of one study .
Included studies
We included three studies with a total of 207 participants. All studies
included women with breast cancer who underwent treatment

participants in the Ho study were Chinese. The other
study did not report the ethnicity of the participants.
Two studies were conducted in the US . One study was conducted in Hong Kong . Trial
sample size ranged from 31 to 139 participants.
One study , used Authentic Movement, which
is a simple form of self-directed expressive movement and involves
a mover/client (or group of movers) and a witness/therapist. The
mover usually moves with eyes closed in order to attend to
and bring a clearer focus to one's own inner experience. While
the mover engages in her experience, listening to her own inner
impulse and following where it may lead her, the witness observes
the mover's experience as well as tracks her own somatic and
imaginative processes . Sandel and colleagues
 used The Lebed MethodTM, Focus on Healing through
Movement and Dance. This method, designed by Lebed-Davis, is
aimed at "restoring the range of motion of the shoulders and
reduce lymphedema, coupled with dance movements designed to
restore a sense of body symmetry, as well as femininity, grace and
sexuality" . Ho used a combination
of dance/movement interventions specifically tailored to meet
the needs of breast cancer patients, including guided movements
to exercise the upper extremities, improvisational dance and
movement to explore positive emotions, and group sharing to
relate the movement process to participants’ personal experiences
of breast cancer and cancer treatment.
Frequency and duration of treatment sessions varied greatly
between the studies. One study , oﬀered
six, weekly sessions that lasted three hours each. The dance/
movement therapy program in the Sandel study was
12 weeks in duration, with two sessions per week for the initial six
weeks and one session per week for the six subsequent weeks, for
a total of 18 sessions. Each session lasted 50 to 60 minutes. Ho's
study oﬀered six sessions held twice a week for three
consecutive weeks, with sessions lasting for 50 to 90 minutes. The
rationale for program length and session frequency in the Sandel
study was to allow for women in treatment or recovery to miss
sessions due to fatigue or side eﬀects.
All studies used a two-arm parallel group design. Two studies used a
wait-list control group . One study
used a standard care control group . The studies did not
measure all outcomes identified for this review.
Details of the studies included in the review are shown in the
Characteristics of included studies table.
Excluded studies
The main reasons for exclusion of studies that appeared eligible
for this review were (a) not a randomized or quasi-randomized
controlled trial (N = 15) and (b) not a dance/movement therapy
intervention study (N = 4). One study was excluded because of
unacceptable treatment allocation method .
Details of the excluded trials are listed in the Characteristics of
excluded studies table.
Risk of bias in included studies
Allocation
Two studies used an appropriate method of randomization,
namely a computer-generated number list .
Although Dibbell-Hope stated that randomization was used, the
author did not report the randomization method . Additional information received from the author revealed
that an alternation method was used for group assignment.
Sandel and colleagues and Ho used proper allocation concealment
procedures. The use of an alternation method for group assignment
prohibited the use of adequate allocation concealment in the
Dibbell-Hope study.
Blinding for subjective outcomes was not possible in all three
studies since study participants could not be blinded to the study
intervention. However, outcome assessors for shoulder range of
motion (ROM) were blinded in the Sandel study. Blinding of
intervention allocation is ofen not possible in dance/movement
therapy studies. This may introduce possible bias.
Incomplete outcome data
The drop-out rate was small for all trials, namely between 6% and
12%. Detailed information on drop-out reasons is included in the
Characteristics of included studies table.
Selective reporting
Two studies did not show evidence of selective reporting . The Ho study is not yet published . We received study results from the author. At the time of this
review, study results for quality of life, were not yet available.
Other potential sources of bias
We did not identify any other potential sources of bias in the studies
included in this review.
As a result of the 'Risk of bias' assessment, we concluded that two
studies were at moderate risk of bias . The
third study presented a high risk of bias . Risk
of bias is detailed for each study in the 'Risk of bias' tables included
within the Characteristics of included studies table and an overall
assessment of risk of bias can be viewed in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

Primary outcomes
Psychological outcomes
One study , examined the eﬀects of dance/
movement therapy on mood disturbance by means of the Profile of
Mood States (POMS) . The investigator reported that
there was no statistically significant diﬀerence at post-test between
the treatment and the control group for this outcome.
Depression
The pooled eﬀect of two studies (N = 170) suggested no eﬀect for dance/movement therapy on
depression (SMD = 0.02, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.32, P = 0.89, I2 = 0%)
(Analysis 1.1).
Two studies examined the eﬀects of dance/movement therapy on
stress or distress .
Dibbell-Hope's study was conducted at two sites (Northern and
Southern sites in San Francisco) and significant diﬀerences were
present for this outcome between the two sites . Therefore, the author presented the findings for the two sites
separately. We computed an average mean and average standard
deviation for the two sites in order to pool the data of this study
with the data from the Ho study. It is important to point out that
the large SDs reported for this outcome in the Dibbell-Hope study
indicate that the data were not normally distributed. Therefore, the
results of this study need to be interpreted with caution.
The pooled estimate of these two studies (N = 170) did not find
support for an eﬀect of dance/movement therapy on stress in
cancer patients (SMD = -0.18, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.12, P = 0.24). The
results were consistent across the studies (I2 = 0%) (Analysis 1.2).
Two studies (N = 170) included anxiety as an outcome . Their pooled estimate suggested that
dance/movement therapy participants demonstrated slightly more
anxiety than control group participants but this eﬀect was not
statistically significant (SMD = 0.21, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.51 P = 0.18, I2
= 0%) (Analysis 1.3).
Somatization
Dibbell-Hope examined the impact of dance/
movement therapy on somatization using the somatization
subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R)
 . The somatization subscale reflects distress arising
from perceptions of bodily dysfunction. The results suggest a
greater reduction in somatization in the dance/movement therapy
than in the control group (SMD = -0.83, 95% CI -1.57 to -0.1, P = 0.03).
Mental Health
One study reported results on the eﬀect of dance/movement
therapy on participants' mental health , as measured
by the subscale of the SF-36 . The mental health score
improved for the treatment group (mean change score = 3.5, SD =
10.56) whereas, it slightly decreased for the control group (mean
change score = -1.5, SD = 12.73), however, the diﬀerence between
the groups was not statistically significant.
Symptom relief
A pooled estimate of two studies (N = 170) found no support for
an eﬀect of dance/movement therapy on fatigue (SMD = -0.36, 95%
-1.26 to 0.55, P = 0.44) . The results
were not consistent across studies (I2 = 80%) with Dibbell-Hope
reporting a greater decrease in fatigue in the treatment group than
the control group.
One study measured the impact of dance/movement therapy on
vigor using the POMS vigor-activity subscale .
The results suggest that dance/movement therapy resulted in
greater vigor than standard care (SMD = 1.44, 95% CI 0.64 to
2.24), P = 0.0004). Using general guidelines for the interpretation
of intervention eﬀects in the social sciences , this is
considered a large treatment eﬀect.
One study examined the impact of dance/movement therapy on
pain severity in cancer patients . There was no significant
diﬀerence between the dance/movement therapy group and the
control group at post-test (MD = -0.30, 95% CI -1.0 to 0.40, P = 0.4).
Physical outcomes
Range of motion (ROM)
One study , reported on the eﬀects of dance/
movement therapy on shoulder ROM of women who underwent
a lumpectomy or more extensive breast surgery at least one
month before the onset of the study. The authors reported that
the ROM in the shoulder on the side of breast surgery increased
15° in the intervention group and 8° in the wait-list control
group. However, the diﬀerence between the two groups was not
statistically significant (P = 0.58).
Arm circumference
Sandel and colleagues also included arm
circumference as an outcome in their study and reported that there
were no changes in arm circumference from pre-test to post-test in
either group, in either the involved or non-involved arm.
Secondary outcomes
Body Image
Two studies (N = 68) examined
the impact of dance/movement therapy on participants' body
image. Their pooled estimate indicated no evidence of eﬀect of
dance/movement therapy and the results were consistent across
the two studies (SMD = -0.13, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.34, P = 0.58, I2 = 0%)
(Analysis 1.5).
Quality of Life
Sandel and colleagues reported on the eﬀects of
dance/movement therapy on health-related QoL. Their results
indicated that the QoL of the women who participated in dance/
movement therapy (mean change score = 14.7, SD = 16.36)

improved significantly compared with the wait-list control group
(mean change score = -1.9, SD = 19.95) afer 12 weeks of treatment
(P = 0.008). When expressed in SMD, the eﬀect of dance/movement
therapy was 0.89 (95% CI 0.21 to 1.57). This is considered a large
treatment eﬀect . This increase in QoL was maintained
as indicated by follow-up measures at 26 weeks.
We did not identify any studies that addressed the other secondary
outcomes listed in the protocol, namely physiological outcomes,
relationship and support, communication and survival.

Summary of main results
Three studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The
following outcomes were shared by at least two studies:
depression, stress, anxiety, fatigue and body image.Their pooled
estimates did not find support for an eﬀect of dance/movement
therapy on any of these outcomes in women with breast cancer
(Summary of findings 1). Results from individual studies suggest
that dance/movement therapy may have a beneficial eﬀect
on quality of life (QoL), somatization, and vigor (Eﬀects of
interventions).
The data from individual studies indicated that there was no
statically significant diﬀerence between treatment and control
groups for mood, mental health, and pain. Finally, the results of one
study did not find support for an eﬀect of dance/movement therapy
on shoulder range of motion (ROM) or arm circumference in women
who underwent a lumpectomy or more extensive breast surgery.
Overall completeness and applicability of evidence
This review included two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and
one quasi-RCT that examined the eﬀects of dance/movement
therapy on women with breast cancer who underwent treatment
within five years of the onset of the study. The small number
of studies included in this review prevents us from drawing
conclusions concerning the applicability of the findings.
For dance/movement therapy no support of an eﬀect was found for
depression, stress, anxiety, fatigue, or body image. However, only
two studies per outcome were included in these meta-analyses and
therefore, no conclusions can be drawn about the eﬀectiveness of
dance/movement therapy for these outcomes at this time.
One study with a moderate risk of bias rating reported a large
eﬀect of dance/movement therapy on QoL . Moreover,
similar improvements were reported for the wait-list control group
during crossover to treatment. One study with a high risk of bias
reported greater improvements in vigor and greater reduction in
somatization in the dance/movement therapy group compared to
a standard care control group .
No support was found in the individual studies for body image,
mood, mental health, pain, ROM or arm circumference. It is
unclear whether this was due to ineﬀectiveness of the treatment,
inappropriate outcome measures (for subjective outcomes) or
limited power of the studies. Sandel and colleagues pointed
out that even though the ROM improvement in the treatment
group was 7° greater than in the control group, a large withingroup variability and small sample size negatively impacted the
statistical analysis of between-group diﬀerences for this outcome
 . As for arm circumference, only a few participants
reported a diagnosis of lymphedema. Therefore, it was diﬀicult
to determine a treatment eﬀect for this outcome. As for body
image, Dibbell-Hope reported contradictory findings between
objective and subjective data in the study . The
objective data indicated no improvement in body image whereas
the subjective data suggested that the participants experienced a
marked improvement in body image. This discrepancy could be due
to the fact that the measurement (Borscheid-Walster-Bohrnstedt
Body Image Scale (BWB)) used in this study was
not sensitive enough to measure the improvements reported by
the participants in the post-treatment interviews. Alternatively, it is
possible that the women exaggerated their reports of improvement
in the interviews to please the researcher. In contrast to the findings
of these two individual studies, results of non-controlled trials
with cancer patients have suggested a beneficial eﬀects of dance/
movement therapy on mood , distress and body image . More research is
needed to examine the impact of dance/movement therapy on
these outcomes.
The results of this review pertain to dance/movement therapy with
women with breast cancer. We did not identify trials that included
patients with other types of cancer, male participants or children.
Therefore, these findings cannot be generalized to these other
population groups.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the evidence (GRADE assessment) in this review
is very low (Summary of findings 1) due to the small number of
included studies (three), the small sample sizes (207 participants
in total) and the high risk of bias of one of the included studies
 .
Two trials received a moderate risk of bias rating . Although few trials were identified that met the inclusion
criteria of this review, the Sandel study demonstrates that it is
possible to conduct a high-quality RCT on the eﬀects of dance/
movement therapy with cancer patients. As blinding of study
participants and therapist is not possible in most dance/movement
therapy studies, it is impossible for these types of clinical studies to
receive a low risk of bias rating. Finally, the reporting of the Sandel
study was excellent.
'Risk of bias' summaries are detailed in Figure 2 and Figure 3.
Potential biases in the review process
We searched all available databases and a large number of journals,
checked reference lists of all relevant trials, contacted relevant
experts for identification of unpublished trials, posted inquiries to
national and international dance/movement therapy listservs and
included publications without restricting language. In spite of such
a comprehensive search, it is still possible that we missed some
published and unpublished trials.
We requested additional data where necessary for all trials
we considered for inclusion. This allowed us to get accurate
information on the trial quality and data for most trials and helped
us make well-informed trial selection decisions.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
This review is the first systematic review on the use of dance/
movement therapy with cancer patients. Only three trials could
be included in this review. By comparison, a recent systematic
review by Koch and colleagues on the eﬀects of dance/movement
therapy and dance on health-related psychological outcomes did
not exclusively focus on cancer patients . It diﬀered
from our present review in two additional ways. First, Koch and
colleagues included a much larger range of studies. Specifically,
their meta-analysis included 23 controlled clinical trials (with or
without randomization) of both dance/movement therapy and
dance interventions, with a large variety of both clinical and nonclinical populations. Thus, pooled estimates for outcome variables
were obtained across heterogenous populations. Secondly, the
inclusion of studies on dance, creative movement and dance/
movement therapy interventions constitutes a diﬀerence from
our review, which focuses entirely on dance/movement therapy
interventions only. The broader scope of the Koch et al. review
aﬀorded a larger total sample for analysis (N = 1078), and more
studies per outcome but increased heterogeneity.Their metaanalysis reported eﬀects for some of the same outcomes examined
herein, as follows: body image (SMD = 0.27, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.57, P
< 0.1, I2= 11%), for quality of life (QoL) (SMD = 0.37 (95% CI 0.18 to
0.55, P < 0.001, I2 =11%), and depression (SMD = 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to
0.56, P < 0.001, I2 = 0%). The results of the Koch review contrast with
our findings in that we found a smaller eﬀect for body image (SMD =
0.13) (Analysis 1.5) and depression (SMD = 0.02) (Analysis 1.1) and a
larger eﬀect for quality of life (SMD = 0.89) , although
the latter was based on just one study. The review by Koch and
colleagues included two of the three studies in this review , and also included one study examined
for inclusion in this review , but which we did not
include because treatment allocation was based on self-selection
by participant into the treatment or control group.
A review by Kiepe and colleagues included 11 RCTs that evaluated
the eﬀect of dance/movement therapy (six studies) and ballroom
dances (five studies) in adults with physical and mental illness (i.e.,
cancer, dementia, depression, and fibromyalgia) in comparison
to other types of intervention or care as usual . Of
the six dance/movement therapy studies that were reviewed by
Kiepe et al., two studies examined the eﬀects of dance/movement
therapy on cancer patients, both of which are included in this
review . According to Kiepe and
colleagues, dance/movement therapy had a positive eﬀect on
quality of life, distress, vitality (vigor), and depressive symptoms.
However, these conclusions were based on results of single studies.
Unfortunately, the discussion section provided by Kiepe and
colleague is quite misleading. They state that dance/movement
therapy has a positive impact on shoulder ROM and body image in
cancer patients whereas no statistically significant between-group
diﬀerences were reported for these outcomes in the original study
 . Instead, Sandel's study reported significant changes
over time for both the dance/movement therapy group and the
control group but no diﬀerence between the groups over time
diﬀerences.
Sandel's findings of a beneficial eﬀect of dance/movement therapy
on QoL are supported by a non-controlled pilot
study in Germany that examined the eﬀects of
dance/movement therapy on quality of life, anxiety, depression
and self-worth in 77 women with cancer. This study used a onegroup pre-test/post-test design. Ninety-minute dance/movement
therapy group sessions were oﬀered two to three times per week
and most women (81%) participated in five to nine sessions. The
results suggested that dance/movement therapy improved the
women's quality of life (P < 0.001) as well as their anxiety (P < 0.001),
depression (P < 0.001) and self worth (P < 0.001).

Implications for practice
Dance/movement therapy has been used with patients with
cancer for provision of social support, reduction of stress, anxiety,
depression and fatigue, improvement in role, social, emotional and
physical functioning and enhancement of QoL variables such as
spirituality and self-esteem. The results of this review are based
on two small-scale trials and one moderately sized trial in women
with breast cancer. The pooled eﬀect of these studies did not
find evidence for eﬀect on depression, stress, anxiety, fatigue or
body image. In contrast, the results of individual trials suggest that
dance/movement therapy may be beneficial for QoL, somatization,
and vigor in women with breast cancer. Data of individual studies
included in this review did not find support for eﬀect of dance/
movement therapy on other outcomes included in this review such
as mood, mental health, pain, ROM or arm circumference. The
low drop-out rate indicates that dance/movement therapy is well
tolerated by these patients. However, in the absence of suﬀicient
evidence, recommendations for clinical practice cannot be made at
this time.
Implications for research
The results of individual studies suggest that dance/movement
therapy may have a beneficial eﬀect on QoL, somatization and vigor
in women with breast cancer. However, more RCTs are needed to
strengthen this evidence. The limited number of RCTs in dance/
movement therapy with cancer patients may be due to lack of
research training and few funding sources for dance/movement
therapy research. There are few opportunities for doctoral research
training specifically in dance/movement therapy and thus currently
not enough researchers prepared to obtain funding for, and carry
out, high-quality large-scale outcome studies.
As this review did not find support for an eﬀect of dance/movement
therapy for several outcomes included in this review, researchers
should consider whether the poor results from the reviewed studies
are possibly due to the lack of sensitivity or inappropriateness
of the outcome measures that were employed. Several dance/
movement therapy researchers have emphasized the importance
of using outcome measures that can capture the eﬀect of a unique
intervention such as dance/movement therapy . Koch and colleagues discuss the
challenge of measuring the impact of nonverbal interventions with
verbal intervention tools .
Brevity of the treatment period is recognized as one of the possible
causes of lack of treatment eﬀect in dance/movement therapy
research. The treatment duration in the three studies included in
this review ranged from three weeks to 12 weeks. Future research
should investigate optimal treatment dose and duration for dance/
movement therapy interventions with people with cancer. This

must take into consideration that dance/movement therapy, like
other treatment options in the complementary and integrative
therapy realm, has been identified as requiring “systematic
therapeutic learning” meaning that a period
of initial learning to become conversant in the therapy medium
(in this case expressive movement) is typically necessary before
benefits are manifest and measurable.
Dance/movement therapy is not a manualized therapy and the
necessarily improvisational clinical methods render it challenging
for researchers to systematize the intervention. Dance/movement
therapy researchers should develop ways to ensure treatment
fidelity in RCTs while retaining the spontaneous, client-centered
properties of the therapy. Berrol, Ooi and Katz have
demonstrated that this can be done in a large multi-site dance/
movement therapy project with older adults.
Although we strongly recommend that more RCTs are needed, it is
important that qualitative research and results of non-controlled
research be considered, as these enhance our understanding of
the qualitative aspects of a patients' experience and identify
factors that may contribute to, or limit, the eﬀectiveness of dance/
movement therapy interventions. In addition, mixed methodology
is appropriate for investigating emerging therapies such as dance/
movement therapy. The use of rigorous mixed-method designs
will both generate useful outcome data and provide insight as to
the possible mechanisms of dance/movement therapy with cancer
patients. Qualitative findings can yield more targeted hypotheses
for future RCTs as well.
Sandel and colleagues recommend that future trials include an
active control group (e.g. exercise group without music and dance)
to further diﬀerentiate the particular benefits of dance/movement
therapy. One such study of a short-term dance/movement therapy
intervention successfully controlled for the eﬀects of exercise alone
and music alone, demonstrating the benefits of interactive dance
for the reduction of depression in psychiatric patients .
Researchers need to consider examining the eﬀects of dance/
movement therapy with population groups other than women
with breast cancer. Future studies should explore the utility of this
modality for men with cancer as well as for women with other types
of cancer. Furthermore, the influence of factors such as gender, age
and culture should be carefully examined.
Future trials will also need to examine the relationship between
frequency and duration of dance/movement therapy interventions
and treatment eﬀects. Researchers should also evaluate the impact
of treatment timing relative to diagnosis and treatment stage.
It is important that future studies include power analysis so that
adequate sample sizes are used.
Finally, formal evaluation of the cost and benefit of dance/
movement therapy is needed.

Interventions
Two study groups:
1. Dance/movement therapy group: The DMT program consisted of six 90-minute long DMT sessions
held twice a week for three consecutive weeks. The program contents were specially tailored to meet
the needs of breast cancer patients, including guided movements to exercise upper extremities, improvisational dance and movement to explore positive emotions and for fun, as well as group sharing to
relate the movement process to participants’ personal experiences of breast cancer and cancer treatment.
2. Control group: standard care
Number of sessions: 6

We had planned to only include clinical trials that used appropriate methods of randomization. However, due to a limited number of
available studies, we considered trials that used quasi-randomized or systematic methods of treatment allocation for this review.
In the protocol, it was stated that the Trials Register of the Cochrane Cancer Network would be searched. However, that register is no longer
functional.
Because of conversion from Revman 5.0 to Revman 5.3 the ‘Risk of bias' tool was changed during the preparation of the review as well as
the 'Study selection, quality assessment and data extraction form' (Appendix 14).
New information is unlikely to change the conclusions of the review. This review is considered stable.
