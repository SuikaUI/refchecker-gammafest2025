Abstract-Many
forms of learning depend on the ability of an organism to sense and react to the adaptive
value of its behavior. Such value, if reflected in the activity of specific neural structures (neural value
systems), can selectively increase the probability of adaptive behaviors by modulating synaptic changes
in the circuits relevant to those behaviors. Neuromodulatory
systems in the brain are well suited to carry
out this process since they respond to evolutionarily important cues (innate value), broadcast their
responses to widely distributed areas of the brain through diffuse projections, and release substances that
can modulate changes in synaptic strength.
The main aim of this paper is to show that, if value-dependent modulation is extended to the inputs
of neural value systems themselves, initially neutral cues can acquire value. This process has important
implications for the acquisition of behavioral sequences. We have used a synthetic neural model to
illustrate value-dependent acquisition of a simple foveation response to a visual stimulus. We then examine
the improvement that ensues when the connections to the value system are themselves plastic and thus
become able to mediate acquired value. Using a second-order conditioning paradigm, we demonstrate that
auditory discrimination can occur in the model in the absence of direct positive reinforcement and even
in the presence of slight negative reinforcement.
The discriminative responses are accompanied
value-dependent plasticity of receptive fields, as reflected in the selective augmentation of unit responses
to valuable sensory cues. We then consider the time-course during learning of the responses of the value
system and the transfer of these responses from one sensory modality to another. Finally, we discuss the
relation of value-dependent learning to models of reinforcement learning. The results obtained from these
simulations can be directly related to various reported experimental findings and provide additional
support for the application of selectional principles to the analysis of brain and behavior.

modulate synaptic changes in multiple brain regions
to provide various constraints
for the selection of
adaptive behaviors in somatic time. In this article, we
use a synthetic neural model to extend our previous
work on value and value systems as they relate to the
brain.12,38,48 Our main goal here is to address in detail
how value systems themselves can be modified and
extended by experience.
The central idea of the theory of neuronal group
selection is that selective processes operate in the
nervous systems of individuals
to enhance adaptive
behavior despite the absence of predetermined
egories and fixed rewards in the environment.
