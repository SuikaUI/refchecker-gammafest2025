A hospital-based case-control study was undertaken to examine the role of human papillomavirus
(HPV) in the development of invasive cervical
Brazil. The study included
199 histologically
confirmed incident cases and 225 age-frequency-matched controls selected from a wide range of diagnostic
categories. A polymerase chain reaction technique was used to detect HPV DNA in cervical specimens
collected with spatula and brush. HPV DNA was detected in 84% of the cases compared with 17% of
controls. Grouping HPV types 16, 18, 31 and 33, 66% of the cases were positive compared with only 6% of
the controls. In addition to HPV, number of sexual partners, early age at first intercourse, parity and duration
of oral contraceptive use were significantly associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer. A history of
previous Papanicolaou smears was significantly associated with
a decreased
risk. After adjustment, only
presence of HPV DNA, parity and history of previous smears remained as independent risk factors. The
adjusted odds ratios of cervical cancer associated with HPV 16, 18, 31, and 33 was 69.7 (95% confidence
interval 28.7-169.6) and with unidentified types was 12.0 (5.1-28.5). The very high risks found in this study
further implicate this virus in the aetiology of cervical cancer.

These viruses have been further classified according to their

18, 31, 33, 35, 51, 52) have been linked to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II and III and invasive cervical
cancer, whereas 'low-risk' types (e.g. HPV 6, 11, 42, 43, 44)
have been associated with condylomata acuminata and CIN I

Patients and methods
Study population
Between June 1990 and June 1991 women with a diagnosis of
invasive cervical cancer and women selected as controls were
recruited from seven hospitals in Sao Paulo City. Five of
these are general hospitals, and two are hospitals for the
treatment of cancer. The cases were women between 25 and
79 years of age, whose diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology and who had had no previous treatment for the
disease. Controls were enrolled from the same five general
hospitals from which the cases were recruited. For cases from
in which only
(n = 48), controls were selected from the largest general hospital included in the study. This was because had the cancer
cases had another disease it is likely that they would have
been treated there as it is the most commonly used referral
hospital in the city. Controls were frequency matched to
cases in 5-year age groups. Those with diseases associated
with known risk factors for cervical neoplasia were excluded
(sexually transmitted diseases, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular
thromboembolism,
thrombophlebitis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, neoplasia of the
breast, reproductive and respiratory organs, anus, oral cavity,
oesophagus, bladder and liver). Women who were admitted

Women with a psychiatric illness were ineligible as cases or
Evidence of a gynaecological

not a criterion for exclusion.
A total of 206 women with invasive cervical cancer and
238 controls were eligible for investigation; 199 (96.6%) and
225 (94.5%), respectively, agreed to be interviewed. Reasons
for non-participation were refusal (three cases,
11 controls),
death (three cases) and inability to locate (one case, two
controls). Of the 199 cases, 178 (89.4%) had squamous cell
carcinoma, nine (4.5%) adenocarcinoma, nine (4.5%) adenosquamous carcinoma and three (1.5%) undifferentiated carcinoma. The diagnoses for the 225 controls were diseases of
the circulatory system (48), infectious and parasitic diseases
(29), diseases of the digestive system (25), endocrine diseases
(23), neoplasms (22), diseases of the
nervous system and
sense organs (17), diseases of the respiratory system (16) and
various other conditions (45). In order to be able to adjust
simultaneously for number of sexual partners and age at first

199 cases and 218 controls who reported having had at least
one sexual partner.
Data and specimen collection
Study subjects were interviewed privately in the hospital by
one of five trained personnel who were blind to their casecontrol status. Using a standardised questionnaire, information
behaviour,
reproductive
history, contraceptive practice, smoking habits and history of
any previous Papanicolaou (Pap) smears. Care was taken to
include questions that would distinguish between the taking
of smears and other gynaecological examinations. All reports
of smears taken in the 12 months prior to interview were
omitted from the analysis as it was thought that they could
be related
to case diagnosis.
Several measures of socioeconomic status were investigated, including literacy, years of
schooling,
educational
level and income per capita. The
women were also asked whether or not they had the following 'household facilities': mains water supply, a sewage disposal system, a television set and a refrigerator. All study
participants had a pelvic examination performed by a gynaecologist when exfoliated cells for cytological examination and
for HPV analysis were collected. Two cases (1.0%) and nine
controls (4.1%) did not have specimens taken.
All cytology and histopathology was undertaken at the
Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo. Of the
199 biopsies, 195 (98.0%) were read by a single experienced
pathologist. Pap smears were read by one cytotechnician
supervised by the same pathologist to exclude invasive cervical carcinoma in the control group. One control (0.5%)
had cytological evidence of a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; she was retained in the study.
Sample preparation and detection of HP V DNA
Material was collected for the HPV assays using two wooden
spatulas and two brushes. For each woman, a smear was
made by sampling cells from the ectocervix with a spatula
and from the endocervix with a brush. The spatula and brush
were then introduced
into a tube containing phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). A second sample of ectocervical and
endocervical cells was collected with a second spatula and
brush and introduced into the same tube. The tubes were
vigorously vortexed and the suspension was centrifuged for
10 min at 2000 r.p.m. The pellets were resuspended in 1.0 ml
of PBS solution and centrifuged again at 3000 r.p.m. for
10 min. The pellets were stored at - 70Â°C. During sample
preparation
care was taken
to avoid contamination;
equipment used was disposable. When the study was completed, all the material was sent for HPV DNA analysis to
the Department of Pathology at the Free University Hospital
in Amsterdam.
was performed
suspensions by a combination of general primer-mediated
and type-specific PCR (GP-PCR/TS-PCR) . Briefly, a first screening to determine the overall
presence of HPV was performed using general primers GP
5/6 in the PCR, which permits the detection of the sequenced
genital HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31 and 33 but also detects
still unsequenced genital HPV types at the subpicogram level
 . After low-stringency Southern blot
analysis with probes of HPV-specific PCR products, the GP-
PCR-positive scrapes were subjected to TS-PCR to establish
the specific type of HPV present. Mixtures of HPV 6, 16, 33
and HPV 11, 18, 31 specific primer sets were used
to detect the
sequenced HPV genotypes.
TS-PCR products were identified by size determination
and by Southern blot analysis using internal oligonucleotide
probes. Scrapes that were positive by GP-PCR and negative
by TS-PCR were suspected of containing
still unidentified
HPV genotypes. Special precautions taken to minimise falsepositive results in the PCR have been described in detail
elsewhere . To analyse the quality
of target DNA for PCR purposes, scrapes were subjected to
PCR using P-globin gene-specific primers. When this target of
the P-globin gene was successfully amplified it indicated that
the DNA was suitable for PCR analysis.
Statistical analysis
of cervical
associated
selected factors, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated as approximations of relative
risks using unconditional logistic regression analysis . Potential confounding variables and interactions with the factors of interest were examined using this
method. Statistical significance was assessed using the likelihood ratio test . Tests for trend were
made by categorising the exposure variables and entering the
scores as continuous. As measures of socioeconomic status,
income per capita and number of household facilities showed
the strongest association with risk of cervical cancer. When
the variables of interest were adjusted by either of these
measures, the results were very similar. Since more than 12%
of women did not know the family income, and as data on
household facilities were complete, the latter was chosen as
the indicator for socioeconomic status. All odds ratios were
adjusted for age in 5-year groups (25-29, 30-34, ... 75-79
years) and for socioeconomic status in four categories (having four, three, two and one or no household
facilities).
Parity was defined as number of live and still births. Sixtyfive cases (32.7%) and 49 controls (22.5%) were not living in
Sao Paulo in the 12 months before the interview. When the
data were examined by place of residence, the risk estimates
associated with the main variables of interest were of similar
magnitude. The odds ratios were not, therefore, adjusted for
place of residence.
The mean age of both cases and controls was similar, being
52.1 years and 52.4 years respectively. There was, however, a
difference in the socioeconomic status of cases and controls.

in 32 (17%) of the 190 controls with cervical specimens
(exfoliated cells) in which the P-globin gene was amplified.
Cervical specimens obtained by biopsy were available from
16 of the 29 cases whose smear was negative for HPV DNA;
in eight (50%) of them HPV DNA was detected. Although
there was a decline in the percentage of controls with HPV

was a strong protective effect associated with number of Pap

cancer associated with ever having smoked was of borderline
significance (OR = 1.51, P = 0.055). No trend of increasing

Except for HPV 6 (only one control positive) and HPV 11
(no participant positive), all the other types of HPV investigated were highly associated with risk. Eighty-four per cent
of the cases were positive for HPV compared with 17% of
controls. The most common type of HPV among cases was
16, whereas among controls unidentified HPV types
were the most frequent. There were six cases but no controls
infected with HPV 31 or HPV 33. Double infections were
found only in cases. Grouping high-risk types (HPV 16/18/
31/33), almost 66% of the cases were positive compared with
only 6% of the controls. The odds ratio of cervical cancer
associated with these types was 75.1 (95% CI 34.2-165.0)
(Table III).
Table IV shows the risks associated with each of the
factors found to have been significantly related to cervical
cancer risk after adjustment for age, socioeconomic status
and all the other factors in the table. Only detection of HPV
DNA, number of Pap smears and parity remained independently associated with
risk of cervical
cancer. The risks
associated with the HPV types investigated remained almost
unchanged from those shown in Table III.

Although there appears to be a stronger effect of smoking in
the HPV-negative stratum, the term for interaction was not
significant (P = 0.18). The use of oral contraceptives for 5 or
more years was associated with a higher risk in the HPVpositive stratum. However, in this stratum the use of oral
contraceptives for a shorter period was not associated with
an increased risk of cervical cancer when compared with
never-users (the odds ratio was even lower). Therefore, the
term for interaction had a large P value (0.81). Although

Discussion
This is the first case-control study of invasive cervical cancer
ever reported from Brazil. We found that 84% of cervical
cancer cases had HPV DNA in their cervical smears
detected by PCR. This is similar to the prevalence found in a
French study (84%) and in an Australian
study (80%) , in which cervical carcinoma specimens were obtained by biopsy or surgical excision. It should be stressed that a further eight cases had a
negative smear but a positive biopsy for HPV DNA. A low
number of neoplastic cells in the smears in combination with
the presence of blood, cervical flora and mucus may inhibit
amplification when exfoliated cells are used. When a biopsy
is taken a piece of tissue that is more likely to contain mainly
malignant cells is selected. Thus, the true HPV prevalence
among the cases could have been even higher. On the other
hand, despite the precautions taken, there is the possibility of
false positives in the smears. Although PCR is now considered the technique of choice for epidemiological studies,
no comparisons of the leading PCR-based strategies have so
far been carried out .
The prevalence of 'high-risk' types (16/18/31/33) was 66%
among our cases. Seventeen per cent of controls had HPV
DNA, but only 6% contained the DNA sequences for the
types commonly associated with cervical cancer. Although
not statistically significant, among controls there was a decline in the HPV prevalence with increasing age, a finding
also demonstrated in other studies . In contrast, among cases, HPV prevalence was
persistently high in all age groups. This could indicate that
many women acquire HPV although most would suppress or
lose the infection. A few with continuous infection may go
on to develop cervical intraepithelial neoplasia that eventually might evolve to invasive disease, while others become
chronic carriers of the infection. That many genital HPV
infections are transient has been suggested by others .
No significant association was found between the prevalence of HPV infection and number of sexual partners.
Similar findings from previous studies have been partially
attributed to the low accuracy of the HPV detection technique used,
in situ hybridisation (FISH) . The consequence of non-differential misclassification
of HPV status has been addressed recently by Franco ,
who suggests that even low levels of misclassification might
deform the association between sexual activity and HPV
infection.
results from
cross-sectional
study involving 467 women have shown a strong correlation
between HPV infection detected by PCR and number of
sexual partners . That in the current study
statistically
significant
association was found, despite
using PCR, may be because only 33% of the women in this
control group reported having had more than one sexual
partner compared with 81% of those in their investigation.
Furthermore, the mean age in this study was 52 years compared with only 23 years in the cross-sectional study (only 25
women were 30 years old or more). If HPV infection can be
transient in women with normal cervices, PCR will not identify
all women who have ever been infected. This could
explain the lack of association between number of sexual
partners and HPV DNA detection among older women.
However, in this study the number of controls positive for
HPV DNA was too small to permit stratification by both age
and number of sexual partners. Nevertheless, two
cross-sectional studies employing PCR have not found any
association between HPV detection and number of sexual
partners . Another
explanation could be the partners' sexual behaviour. The
'male factor' will be addressed in a future report.
Increasing
of regular
associated with higher HPV prevalence, mainly among cases,
whereas no association at
all was found with increasing
number of casual partners.
It could be conceived that to
acquire and have persistent infection frequent contacts with
an infected partner would be usually needed. However, as the
natural history of HPV infection is only just beginning to be
understood, this
is merely speculation. Another possibility
could be that there is more chance of misclassification for
number of casual partners than for number of regular partners.

significantly related to an increased risk and number of Pap
smears to be significantly
related to a decreased
cervical cancer. However, in a multivariate analysis in which
all the variables were adjusted for each other as well as for
age and socioeconomic status, only HPV DNA, number of
Pap smears and parity remained as independent risk factors.
While the efficacy of cytological screening has never been
evaluated by a randomised trial, many studies have found
evidence of protection against the development of cervical
cancer . The risk of
cervical cancer associated with presence of the 'high-risk'
HPV types 16/18/31/33 was 69.7 (95% CI 28.7-169.6). Risks

6.1- 13.6) with high signal intensity for HPV 16/18 using
filter in situ hybridisation . However, this
assay is now considered as the least accurate hybridisation
test for the detection of HPV DNA . Three
studies, in which the PCR technique was used, also found
high risks for cervical neoplasia associated with HPV . In
China, the risk of invasive cervical cancer associated with
HPV types 16/33 was 32.9 (95% CI 7.7-141.1) . In a population-based case-control study of invasive
cervical cancer the risk related to any type of HPV DNA was

It has been postulated that smoking 
and oral contraceptive use might interact
with HPV in the aetiology of cervical cancer. In this study
there was no evidence of interaction between HPV and smoking. Nor was
statistically
significant
interaction
between HPV and duration of oral contraceptive use, a
finding that was demonstrated in the study from Colombia
and Spain . An increased risk associated
with HPV infection was found among women who used oral
contraceptives for longer periods. Although this finding could
be due to chance, it is in agreement with oral contraceptives
acting as a promoter for other risk factor(s), in this circumstance HPV. Nevertheless, some investigators suggest that the
role of exogenous mutagenic factors may have been overemphasised previously .
It should be pointed out that the small number of HPVpositive controls (32) and of HPV-negative cases (29) limits
the possibility of detecting statistically significant interactions
between HPV and the other risk factors for cervical cancer.
This lack of power has also been a limitation of other
studies. Specially designed case-control studies matched on
HPV status might increase the power.
With a case-control design one cannot be sure whether the
HPV infection preceded or post-dated the disease. In addition, it might be easier to detect HPV in infected cancer cells
rather than in infected non-malignant cells. So far, only a few
small follow-up studies have been published with results that
have no clear interpretation . However, a recent follow-up study of 241 women with normal
cytology has found a relative risk of 11 (95% CI 4.6-26) for
the development of CINII-III related to infection with HPV
16/18 .
Our study had limitations in that it was hospital based and
not restricted to women with permanent residence in Sao
Paulo. However, we selected controls with a wide range of

be explained by the limitations outlined above. The experimental evidence for the malignant potential of HPV and the
very high risks found in this study, particularly in relation to
HPV types 16, 18, 31 and 33, further implicates this virus in
the aetiology of cervical cancer.
