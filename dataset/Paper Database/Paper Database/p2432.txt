A new method for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been developed. The key part of the method is the ‘empirical mode decomposition’ method
with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a ﬁnite and often
small number of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly eﬃcient. Since
the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is
applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform,
the ‘instrinic mode functions’ yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time
that give sharp identiﬁcations of imbedded structures. The ﬁnal presentation of the
results is an energy–frequency–time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum.
In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of ‘intrinsic
mode functions’ based on local properties of the signal, which makes the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies
for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to represent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of
the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena
are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system
data are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the
nonlinear and non-stationary eﬀects in the energy–frequency–time distribution.

1. Introduction
Data analysis is a necessary part in pure research and practical applications. Imperfect as some data might be, they represent the reality sensed by us; consequently,
data analysis serves two purposes: to determine the parameters needed to construct
the necessary model, and to conﬁrm the model we constructed to represent the phenomenon. Unfortunately, the data, whether from physical measurements or numerical
modelling, most likely will have one or more of the following problems: (a) the total
data span is too short; (b) the data are non-stationary; and (c) the data represent
nonlinear processes. Although each of the above problems can be real by itself, the
ﬁrst two are related, for a data section shorter than the longest time scale of a stationary process can appear to be non-stationary. Facing such data, we have limited
options to use in the analysis.
Historically, Fourier spectral analysis has provided a general method for examining the global energy–frequency distributions. As a result, the term ‘spectrum’ has
become almost synonymous with the Fourier transform of the data. Partially because
of its prowess and partially because of its simplicity, Fourier analysis has dominated
the data analysis eﬀorts since soon after its introduction, and has been applied to
all kinds of data. Although the Fourier transform is valid under extremely general
conditions , there are some crucial restrictions of
the Fourier spectral analysis: the system must be linear; and the data must be strictly periodic or stationary; otherwise, the resulting spectrum will make little physical
The stationarity requirement is not particular to the Fourier spectral analysis;
it is a general one for most of the available data analysis methods. Therefore, it
behoves us to review the deﬁnitions of stationarity here. According to the traditional
deﬁnition, a time series, X(t), is stationary in the wide sense, if, for all t,
E(|X(t)2|) < ∞,
E(X(t)) = m,
C(X(t1), X(t2)) = C(X(t1 + τ), X(t2 + τ)) = C(t1 −t2),
in which E(·) is the expected value deﬁned as the ensemble average of the quantity,
and C(·) is the covariance function. Stationarity in the wide sense is also known
as weak stationarity, covariance stationarity or second-order stationarity . A time series, X(t), is strictly stationary, if the
joint distribution of
[X(t1), X(t2), . . . , X(tn)]
[X(t1 + τ), X(t2 + τ), . . . , X(tn + τ)]
are the same for all ti and τ. Thus, a strictly stationary process with ﬁnite second
moments is also weakly stationary, but the inverse is not true. Both deﬁnitions are
rigorous but idealized. Other less rigorous deﬁnitions for stationarity have also been
used; for example, piecewise stationarity is for any random variable that is stationary
within a limited time span, and asymptotically stationary is for any random variable
that is stationary when τ in equations (1.1) or (1.2) approaches inﬁnity. In practice,
we can only have data for ﬁnite time spans; therefore, even to check these deﬁnitions, we have to make approximations. Few of the data sets, from either natural
phenomena or artiﬁcial sources, can satisfy these deﬁnitions. It may be argued that
the diﬃculty of invoking stationarity as well as ergodicity is not on principle but
on practicality: we just cannot have enough data to cover all possible points in the
phase plane; therefore, most of the cases facing us are transient in nature. This is
the reality; we are forced to face it.
Other than stationarity, Fourier spectral analysis also requires linearity. Although
many natural phenomena can be approximated by linear systems, they also have
the tendency to be nonlinear whenever their variations become ﬁnite in amplitude.
Compounding these complications is the imperfection of our probes or numerical
schemes; the interactions of the imperfect probes even with a perfect linear system
can make the ﬁnal data nonlinear. For the above reasons, the available data are usually of ﬁnite duration, non-stationary and from systems that are frequently nonlinear,
either intrinsically or through interactions with the imperfect probes or numerical
schemes. Under these conditions, Fourier spectral analysis is of limited use. For lack
of alternatives, however, Fourier spectral analysis is still used to process such data.
The uncritical use of Fourier spectral analysis and the insouciant adoption of the
stationary and linear assumptions may give misleading results; some of those are
described as follows.
First, the Fourier spectrum deﬁnes uniform harmonic components globally; therefore, it needs many additional harmonic components to simulate non-stationary data
that are non-uniform globally. As a result, it spreads the energy over a wide frequency range. For example, using a delta function to represent a ﬂash of light will give
a phase-locked wide white Fourier spectrum. Here, many Fourier components are
added to simulate the non-stationary nature of the data in the time domain, but
their existence diverts energy to a much wider frequency domain. Constrained by
the energy conservation, these spurious harmonics and the wide frequency spectrum
cannot faithfully represent the true energy density in the frequency space. More seriously, the Fourier representation also requires the existence of negative light intensity
so that the components can cancel out one another to give the ﬁnal delta function.
Thus, the Fourier components might make mathematical sense, but do not really
make physical sense at all. Although no physical process can be represented exactly
by a delta function, some data such as the near-ﬁeld strong earthquake records are
of extremely short durations lasting only a few seconds to tens of seconds at most.
Such records almost approach a delta function, and they always give artiﬁcially wide
Fourier spectra.
Second, Fourier spectral analysis uses linear superposition of trigonometric functions; therefore, it needs additional harmonic components to simulate the deformed
wave-proﬁles. Such deformations, as will be shown later, are the direct consequence
of nonlinear eﬀects. Whenever the form of the data deviates from a pure sine or
cosine function, the Fourier spectrum will contain harmonics. As explained above,
both non-stationarity and nonlinearity can induce spurious harmonic components
that cause energy spreading. The consequence is the misleading energy–frequency
distribution for nonlinear and non-stationary data.
In this paper, we will present a new data analysis method based on the empirical
mode decomposition (EMD) method, which will generate a collection of intrinsic
mode functions (IMF). The decomposition is based on the direct extraction of the
energy associated with various intrinsic time scales, the most important parameters
of the system. Expressed in IMFs, they have well-behaved Hilbert transforms, from
which the instantaneous frequencies can be calculated. Thus, we can localize any
event on the time as well as the frequency axis. The decomposition can also be viewed
as an expansion of the data in terms of the IMFs. Then, these IMFs, based on and
derived from the data, can serve as the basis of that expansion which can be linear
or nonlinear as dictated by the data, and it is complete and almost orthogonal. Most
important of all, it is adaptive. As will be shown later in more detail, locality and
adaptivity are the necessary conditions for the basis for expanding nonlinear and
non-stationary time series; orthogonality is not a necessary criterion for our basis
selection for a nonlinear system. The principle of this basis construction is based
on the physical time scales that characterize the oscillations of the phenomena. The
local energy and the instantaneous frequency derived from the IMFs through the
Hilbert transform can give us a full energy–frequency–time distribution of the data.
Such a representation is designated as the Hilbert spectrum; it would be ideal for
nonlinear and non-stationary data analysis.
We have obtained good results and new insights by applying the combination of
the EMD and Hilbert spectral analysis methods to various data: from the numerical
results of the classical nonlinear equation systems to data representing natural phenomena. The classical nonlinear systems serve to illustrate the roles played by the
nonlinear eﬀects in the energy–frequency–time distribution. With the low degrees
of freedom, they can train our eyes for more complicated cases. Some limitations of
this method will also be discussed and the conclusions presented. Before introducing
the new method, we will ﬁrst review the present available data analysis methods for
non-stationary processes.
2. Review of non-stationary data processing methods
We will ﬁrst give a brief survey of the methods available for processing nonstationary data. Since most of the methods still depend on Fourier analysis, they
are limited to linear systems only. Of the few methods available, the adoption of
any method is almost strictly determined according to the special ﬁeld in which the
application is made. The available methods are reviewed as follows.
(a ) The spectrogram
The spectrogram is the most basic method, which is nothing but a limited time
window-width Fourier spectral analysis. By successively sliding the window along the
time axis, one can get a time–frequency distribution. Since it relies on the traditional Fourier spectral analysis, one has to assume the data to be piecewise stationary.
This assumption is not always justiﬁed in non-stationary data. Even if the data are
piecewise stationary how can we guarantee that the window size adopted always
coincides with the stationary time scales? What can we learn about the variations
longer than the local stationary time scale? Will the collection of the locally stationary pieces constitute some longer period phenomena? Furthermore, there are also
practical diﬃculties in applying the method: in order to localize an event in time,
the window width must be narrow, but, on the other hand, the frequency resolution requires longer time series. These conﬂicting requirements render this method
of limited usage. It is, however, extremely easy to implement with the fast Fourier
transform; thus, it has attracted a wide following. Most applications of this method
are for qualitative display of speech pattern analysis .
(b ) The wavelet analysis
The wavelet approach is essentially an adjustable window Fourier spectral analysis
with the following general deﬁnition:
W(a, b; X, ψ) = |a|−1/2
∗(·) is the basic wavelet function that satisﬁes certain very general conditions, a is the dilation factor and b is the translation of the origin. Although time and
frequency do not appear explicitly in the transformed result, the variable 1/a gives
the frequency scale and b, the temporal location of an event. An intuitive physical
explanation of equation (2.1) is very simple: W(a, b; X, ψ) is the ‘energy’ of X of
scale a at t = b.
Because of this basic form of at+b involved in the transformation, it is also known
as aﬃne wavelet analysis. For speciﬁc applications, the basic wavelet function,
can be modiﬁed according to special needs, but the form has to be given before the
analysis. In most common applications, however, the Morlet wavelet is deﬁned as
Gaussian enveloped sine and cosine wave groups with 5.5 waves . Generally,
∗(·) is not orthogonal for diﬀerent a for continuous wavelets.
Although one can make the wavelet orthogonal by selecting a discrete set of a, this
discrete wavelet analysis will miss physical signals having scale diﬀerent from the
selected discrete set of a. Continuous or discrete, the wavelet analysis is basically a
linear analysis. A very appealing feature of the wavelet analysis is that it provides a
uniform resolution for all the scales. Limited by the size of the basic wavelet function,
the downside of the uniform resolution is uniformly poor resolution.
Although wavelet analysis has been available only in the last ten years or so, it has
become extremely popular. Indeed, it is very useful in analysing data with gradual
frequency changes. Since it has an analytic form for the result, it has attracted
extensive attention of the applied mathematicians. Most of its applications have
been in edge detection and image compression. Limited applications have also been
made to the time–frequency distribution in time series and two-dimensional images .
Versatile as the wavelet analysis is, the problem with the most commonly used
Morlet wavelet is its leakage generated by the limited length of the basic wavelet
function, which makes the quantitative deﬁnition of the energy–frequency–time distribution diﬃcult. Sometimes, the interpretation of the wavelet can also be counterintuitive. For example, to deﬁne a change occurring locally, one must look for the
result in the high-frequency range, for the higher the frequency the more localized the
basic wavelet will be. If a local event occurs only in the low-frequency range, one will
still be forced to look for its eﬀects in the high-frequency range. Such interpretation
will be diﬃcult if it is possible at all . Another
diﬃculty of the wavelet analysis is its non-adaptive nature. Once the basic wavelet
is selected, one will have to use it to analyse all the data. Since the most commonly
used Morlet wavelet is Fourier based, it also suﬀers the many shortcomings of Fourier spectral analysis: it can only give a physically meaningful interpretation to linear
phenomena; it can resolve the interwave frequency modulation provided the frequency variation is gradual, but it cannot resolve the intrawave frequency modulation
because the basic wavelet has a length of 5.5 waves. In spite of all these problems,
wavelet analysis is still the best available non-stationary data analysis method so far;
therefore, we will use it in this paper as a reference to establish the validity and the
calibration of the Hilbert spectrum.
(c ) The Wigner–Ville distribution
The Wigner–Ville distribution is sometimes also referred to as the Heisenberg
wavelet. By deﬁnition, it is the Fourier transform of the central covariance function.
For any time series, X(t), we can deﬁne the central variance as
Cc(τ, t) = X(t −1
2τ)X∗(t + 1
Then the Wigner–Ville distribution is
V (ω, t) =
Cc(τ, t)e−iωτ dτ.
This transform has been treated extensively by Claasen & Mecklenbr¨auker and by Cohen . It has been extremely popular with the electrical engineering community.
The diﬃculty with this method is the severe cross terms as indicated by the existence of negative power for some frequency ranges. Although this shortcoming can
be eliminated by using the Kernel method , the result
is, then, basically that of a windowed Fourier analysis; therefore, it suﬀers all the limitations of the Fourier analysis. An extension of this method has been made by Yen
 , who used the Wigner–Ville distribution to deﬁne wave packets that reduce
a complicated data set to a ﬁnite number of simple components. This extension
is very powerful and can be applied to a variety of problems. The applications to
complicated data, however, require a great amount of judgement.
(d ) Evolutionary spectrum
The evolutionary spectrum was ﬁrst proposed by Priestley . The basic idea
is to extend the classic Fourier spectral analysis to a more generalized basis: from
sine or cosine to a family of orthogonal functions {φ(ω, t)} indexed by time, t, and
deﬁned for all real ω, the frequency. Then, any real random variable, X(t), can be
expressed as
φ(ω, t) dA(ω, t),
in which dA(ω, t), the Stieltjes function for the amplitude, is related to the spectrum
E(| dA(ω, t)|2) = dμ(ω, t) = S(ω, t) dω,
where μ(ω, t) is the spectrum, and S(ω, t) is the spectral density at a speciﬁc time
t, also designated as the evolutionary spectrum. If for each ﬁxed ω, φ(ω, t) has a
Fourier transform
φ(ω, t) = a(ω, t)eiΩ(ω)t,
then the function of a(ω, t) is the envelope of φ(ω, t), and Ω(ω) is the frequency. If,
further, we can treat Ω(ω) as a single valued function of ω, then
φ(ω, t) = α(ω, t)eiωt.
Thus, the original data can be expanded in a family of amplitude modulated trigonometric functions.
The evolutionary spectral analysis is very popular in the earthquake community . The diﬃculty of its
application is to ﬁnd a method to deﬁne the basis, {φ(ω, t)}. In principle, for this
method to work, the basis has to be deﬁned a posteriori. So far, no systematic way
has been oﬀered; therefore, constructing an evolutionary spectrum from the given
data is impossible. As a result, in the earthquake community, the applications of this
method have changed the problem from data analysis to data simulation: an evolutionary spectrum will be assumed, then the signal will be reconstituted based on
the assumed spectrum. Although there is some general resemblance to the simulated
earthquake signal with the real data, it is not the data that generated the spectrum.
Consequently, evolutionary spectrum analysis has never been very useful. As will
be shown, the EMD can replace the evolutionary spectrum with a truly adaptive
representation for the non-stationary processes.
(e ) The empirical orthogonal function expansion (EOF)
The empirical orthogonal function expansion (EOF) is also known as the principal
component analysis, or singular value decomposition method. The essence of EOF
is brieﬂy summarized as follows: for any real z(x, t), the EOF will reduce it to
ak(t)fk(x),
fj · fk = δjk.
The orthonormal basis, {fk}, is the collection of the empirical eigenfunctions deﬁned
C · fk = λkfk,
where C is the sum of the inner products of the variable.
EOF represents a radical departure from all the above methods, for the expansion
basis is derived from the data; therefore, it is a posteriori, and highly eﬃcient. The
critical ﬂaw of EOF is that it only gives a distribution of the variance in the modes
deﬁned by {fk}, but this distribution by itself does not suggest scales or frequency
content of the signal. Although it is tempting to interpret each mode as independent variations, this interpretation should be viewed with great care, for the EOF
decomposition is not unique. A single component out of a non-unique decomposition,
even if the basis is orthogonal, does not usually contain physical meaning. Recently,
Vautard & Ghil proposed the singular spectral analysis method, which is the
Fourier transform of the EOF. Here again, we have to be sure that each EOF component is stationary, otherwise the Fourier spectral analysis will make little sense
on the EOF components. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that EOF components from a nonlinear and non-stationary data set will all be linear and stationary.
Consequently, singular spectral analysis is not a real improvement. Because of its
adaptive nature, however, the EOF method has been very popular, especially in the
oceanography and meteorology communities .
(f ) Other miscellaneous methods
Other than the above methods, there are also some miscellaneous methods such as
least square estimation of the trend, smoothing by moving averaging, and diﬀerencing
to generate stationary data. Methods like these, though useful, are too specialized
to be of general use. They will not be discussed any further here. Additional details
can be found in many standard data processing books .
All the above methods are designed to modify the global representation of the
Fourier analysis, but they all failed in one way or the other. Having reviewed the
methods, we can summarize the necessary conditions for the basis to represent a
nonlinear and non-stationary time series: (a) complete; (b) orthogonal; (c) local; and
(d) adaptive.
The ﬁrst condition guarantees the degree of precision of the expansion; the second
condition guarantees positivity of energy and avoids leakage. They are the standard
requirements for all the linear expansion methods. For nonlinear expansions, the
orthogonality condition needs to be modiﬁed. The details will be discussed later. But
even these basic conditions are not satisﬁed by some of the above mentioned methods. The additional conditions are particular to the nonlinear and non-stationary
data. The requirement for locality is the most crucial for non-stationarity, for in
such data there is no time scale; therefore, all events have to be identiﬁed by the
time of their occurences. Consequently, we require both the amplitude (or energy)
and the frequency to be functions of time. The requirement for adaptivity is also
crucial for both nonlinear and non-stationary data, for only by adapting to the local
variations of the data can the decomposition fully account for the underlying physics
of the processes and not just to fulﬁl the mathematical requirements for ﬁtting the
data. This is especially important for the nonlinear phenomena, for a manifestation
of nonlinearity is the ‘harmonic distortion’ in the Fourier analysis. The degree of
distortion depends on the severity of nonlinearity; therefore, one cannot expect a
predetermined basis to ﬁt all the phenomena. An easy way to generate the necessary
adaptive basis is to derive the basis from the data.
In this paper, we will introduce a general method which requires two steps in
analysing the data as follows. The ﬁrst step is to preprocess the data by the empirical
mode decomposition method, with which the data are decomposed into a number
of intrinsic mode function components. Thus, we will expand the data in a basis
derived from the data. The second step is to apply the Hilbert transform to the
decomposed IMFs and construct the energy–frequency–time distribution, designated
as the Hilbert spectrum, from which the time localities of events will be preserved. In
other words, we need the instantaneous frequency and energy rather than the global
frequency and energy deﬁned by the Fourier spectral analysis. Therefore, before going
any further, we have to clarify the deﬁnition of the instantaneous frequency.
3. Instantaneous frequency
The notion of the instantaneous energy or the instantaneous envelope of the signal
is well accepted; the notion of the instantaneous frequency, on the other hand, has
been highly controversial. Existing opinions range from editing it out of existence
 to accepting it but only for special ‘monocomponent’ signals .
There are two basic diﬃculties with accepting the idea of an instantaneous frequency as follows. The ﬁrst one arises from the deeply entrenched inﬂuence of the
Fourier spectral analysis. In the traditional Fourier analysis, the frequency is deﬁned
for the sine or cosine function spanning the whole data length with constant amplitude. As an extension of this deﬁnition, the instantaneous frequencies also have to
relate to either a sine or a cosine function. Thus, we need at least one full oscillation
of a sine or a cosine wave to deﬁne the local frequency value. According to this logic,
nothing shorter than a full wave will do. Such a deﬁnition would not make sense for
non-stationary data for which the frequency has to change values from time to time.
The second diﬃculty arises from the non-unique way in deﬁning the instantaneous
frequency. Nevertheless, this diﬃculty is no longer serious since the introduction of
the means to make the data analytical through the Hilbert transform. Diﬃculties,
however, still exist as ‘paradoxes’ discussed by Cohen . For an arbitrary time
series, X(t), we can always have its Hilbert Transform, Y (t), as
t −t′ dt′,
where P indicates the Cauchy principal value. This transform exists for all functions
of class Lp . With this deﬁnition, X(t) and Y (t)
form the complex conjugate pair, so we can have an analytic signal, Z(t), as
Z(t) = X(t) + iY (t) = a(t)eiθ(t),
a(t) = [X2(t) + Y 2(t)]1/2,
θ(t) = arctan
Theoretically, there are inﬁnitely many ways of deﬁning the imaginary part, but the
Hilbert transform provides a unique way of deﬁning the imaginary part so that the
result is an analytic function. A brief tutorial on the Hilbert transform with the
emphasis on its physical interpretation can be found in Bendat & Piersol .
Essentially equation (3.1) deﬁnes the Hilbert transform as the convolution of X(t)
with 1/t; therefore, it emphasizes the local properties of X(t). In equation (3.2), the
polar coordinate expression further clariﬁes the local nature of this representation: it
is the best local ﬁt of an amplitude and phase varying trigonometric function to X(t).
Even with the Hilbert transform, there is still considerable controversy in deﬁning
the instantaneous frequency as
This leads Cohen to introduce the term, ‘monocomponent function’. In principle, some limitations on the data are necessary, for the instantaneous frequency
given in equation (3.4) is a single value function of time. At any given time, there
is only one frequency value; therefore, it can only represent one component, hence
‘monocomponent’. Unfortunately, no clear deﬁnition of the ‘monocomponent’ signal
was given to judge whether a function is or is not ‘monocomponent’. For lack of
a precise deﬁnition, ‘narrow band’ was adopted as a limitation on the data for the
instantaneous frequency to make sense .
There are two deﬁnitions for bandwidth. The ﬁrst one is used in the study of the
probability properties of the signals and waves, where the processes are assumed to
be stationary and Gaussian. Then, the bandwidth can be deﬁned in terms of spectral
moments as follows. The expected number of zero crossings per unit time is given by
while the expected number of extrema per unit time is given by
in which mi is the ith moment of the spectrum. Therefore, the parameter, ν, deﬁned
oﬀers a standard bandwidth measure . For a narrow band signal ν = 0, the expected numbers
of extrema and zero crossings have to equal.
The second deﬁnition is a more general one; it is again based on the moments of
the spectrum, but in a diﬀerent way. Let us take a complex valued function in polar
coordinates as
z(t) = a(t)eiθ(t),
with both a(t) and θ(t) being functions of time. If this function has a spectrum,
S(ω), then the mean frequency is given by
ω|S(ω)|2 dω,
which can be expressed in another way as
˙θ(t) −i ˙a(t)
˙θ(t)a2(t) dt.
Based on this expression, Cohen suggested that ˙θ be treated as the instantaneous frequency. With these notations, the bandwidth can be deﬁned as
ν2 = (ω −⟨ω⟩)2
(ω −⟨ω⟩)2|S(ω)|2 dω
˙a2(t) dt +
( ˙θ(t) −⟨ω⟩)2a2(t) dt
For a narrow band signal, this value has to be small, then both a and θ have to be
gradually varying functions. Unfortunately, both equations (3.7) and (3.11) deﬁned
the bandwidth in the global sense; they are both overly restrictive and lack precision at the same time. Consequently, the bandwidth limitation on the Hilbert transform to give a meaningful instantaneous frequency has never been ﬁrmly established.
For example, Melville had faithfully ﬁltered the data within the bandwidth
requirement, but he still obtained many non-physical negative frequency values. It
should be mentioned here that using ﬁltering to obtain a narrow band signal is unsatisfactory for another reason: the ﬁltered data have already been contaminated by the
spurious harmonics caused by the nonlinearity and non-stationarity as discussed in
the introduction.
In order to obtain meaningful instantaneous frequency, restrictive conditions have
to be imposed on the data as discussed by Gabor , Bedrosian and,
more recently, Boashash : for any function to have a meaningful instantaneous
frequency, the real part of its Fourier transform has to have only positive frequency.
This restriction can be proven mathematically as shown in Titchmarsh but it
is still global. For data analysis, we have to translate this requirement into physically
implementable steps to develop a simple method for applications. For this purpose,
we have to modify the restriction condition from a global one to a local one, and the
basis has to satisfy the necessary conditions listed in the last section.
Let us consider some simple examples to illustrate these restrictions physically, by
examining the function,
x(t) = sin t.
Its Hilbert transform is simply cos t. The phase plot of x–y is a simple circle of unit
radius as in ﬁgure 1a. The phase function is a straight line as shown in ﬁgure 1b
and the instantaneous frequency, shown in ﬁgure 1c, is a constant as expected. If we
move the mean oﬀby an amount α, say, then,
x(t) = α + sin t.
Phase angle (rad)

Figure 1. Physical interpretation of instantaneous frequency. (a) The phase plane for the model
functions of x(t) = α + sin t. (a) α = 0; (b) α < 1; (c) α > 1. (b) The unwrapped phase function
of the model functions. (c) The instantaneous frequency computed according to equation (3.4).
The phase plot of x–y is still a simple circle independent of the value of α, but the
centre of the circle will be displaced by the amount of α as illustrated in ﬁgure 1a.
If α < 1, the centre is still within the circle. Under this condition, the function has
already violated a restriction, for its Fourier spectrum has a DC term; nevertheless,
the mean zero-crossing frequency is still the same as in the case for α = 0, but the
phase function and the instantaneous frequency will be very diﬀerent as shown in
ﬁgures 1b, c. If α > 1, the centre is outside the circle; thus, the function no longer
satisﬁes the required conditions. Then both the phase function and the instantaneous
frequency will assume negative values as shown in ﬁgures 1b, c, which are meaningless.
These simple examples illustrate physically that, for a simple signal such as a sine
function, the instantaneous frequency can be deﬁned only if we restrict the function
to be symmetric locally with respect to the zero mean level.
For general data, any riding waves would be equivalent to the case of α > 1 locally;
any asymmetric wave form will be equivalent to the case of α < 1, but non-zero,
locally. In order to have a meaningful instantaneous frequency, this local restriction
should be used in lieu of the global requirements given previously. Furthermore, this
local restriction also suggests a method to decompose the data into components for
which the instantaneous frequency can be deﬁned. The examples presented above,
however, actually lead us to the deﬁnition of a class of functions, based on its local
properties, designated as intrinsic mode function (IMF) for which the instantaneous
frequency can be deﬁned everywhere. The limitation of interest here is not on the
existence of the Hilbert transform which is general and global, but on the existence
of a meaningful instantaneous frequency which is restrictive and local.
4. Intrinsic mode functions
The simple examples given above provide more physical interpretation of the
restrictive conditions; they also suggest a practical way to decompose the data so
that the components all satisfy the conditions imposed on them. Physically, the necessary conditions for us to deﬁne a meaningful instantaneous frequency are that the
functions are symmetric with respect to the local zero mean, and have the same numbers of zero crossings and extrema. Based on these observations, we propose a class
of functions designated as intrinsic mode functions here with the following formal
deﬁnition.
An intrinsic mode function (IMF) is a function that satisﬁes two conditions: (1)
in the whole data set, the number of extrema and the number of zero crossings must
either equal or diﬀer at most by one; and (2) at any point, the mean value of the
envelope deﬁned by the local maxima and the envelope deﬁned by the local minima
The ﬁrst condition is obvious; it is similar to the traditional narrow band requirements for a stationary Gaussian process. The second condition is a new idea; it
modiﬁes the classical global requirement to a local one; it is necessary so that the
instantaneous frequency will not have the unwanted ﬂuctuations induced by asymmetric wave forms. Ideally, the requirement should be ‘the local mean of the data
being zero’. For non-stationary data, the ‘local mean’ involves a ‘local time scale’ to
compute the mean, which is impossible to deﬁne. As a surrogate, we use the local
mean of the envelopes deﬁned by the local maxima and the local minima to force the
local symmetry instead. This is a necessary approximation to avoid the deﬁnition of
a local averaging time scale. Although it will introduce an alias in the instantaneous
frequency for nonlinearly deformed waves, the eﬀects of nonlinearity are much weaker in comparison with non-stationarity as we will discuss later. With the physical
approach and the approximation adopted here, the method does not always guarantee a perfect instantaneous frequency under all conditions. Nevertheless, we will
show that, even under the worst conditions, the instantaneous frequency so deﬁned
is still consistent with the physics of the system studied.
The name ‘intrinsic mode function’ is adopted because it represents the oscillation
mode imbedded in the data. With this deﬁnition, the IMF in each cycle, deﬁned by
the zero crossings, involves only one mode of oscillation, no complex riding waves are
allowed. With this deﬁnition, an IMF is not restricted to a narrow band signal, and it
can be both amplitude and frequency modulated. In fact, it can be non-stationary. As
discussed above, purely frequency or amplitude modulated functions can be IMFs

extrema, and symmetry of the upper and lower envelopes with respect to zero.
even though they have ﬁnite bandwidth according to the traditional deﬁnition. A
typical IMF is shown in ﬁgure 2.
Having deﬁned IMF, we will show that the deﬁnition given in equation (3.4)
gives the best instantaneous frequency. An IMF after the Hilbert transform can
be expressed as in equation (3.2). If we perform a Fourier transform on Z(t), we
a(t)eiθ(t)e−iωt dt, =
a(t)ei(θ(t)−ωt) dt.
Then by the stationary phase method , the maximum
contribution to W(ω) is given by the frequency satisfying the condition
dt(θ(t) −ωt) = 0;
therefore, equation (3.4) follows. Although mathematically, the application of the
stationary phase method requires a large parameter for the exponential function,
the adoption here can be justiﬁed if the frequency, ω, is high compared with the
inversed local time scale of the amplitude variation. Therefore, this deﬁnition ﬁts
the best for gradually changing amplitude. Even with this condition, this is still a
much better deﬁnition for instantaneous frequency than the zero-crossing frequency;
it is also better than the integral deﬁnition suggested by Cohen as given in
equation (3.10). Furthermore, it agrees with the deﬁnition of frequency for the classic
wave theory .
As given in equation (4.2) and the simple analogy given in equations (3.2)–(3.4),
the frequency deﬁned through the stationary phase approximation agrees also with
the best ﬁt sinusoidal function locally; therefore, we do not need a whole oscillatory
period to deﬁne a frequency value. We can deﬁne it for every point with the value changing from point to point. In this sense, even a monotonic function can be
treated as part of an oscillatory function and have instantaneous frequency assigned
according to equation (3.4). Any frequency variation is designated as frequency modulation. There are actually two types of frequency modulations: the interwave and
the intrawave modulations. The ﬁrst type is familiar to us; the frequency of the
oscillation is gradually changing with the waves in a dispersive system. Technically,
in the dispersive waves, the frequency is also changing within one wave, but that
was not emphasized either for convenience, or for lack of a more precise frequency
deﬁnition. The second type is less familiar, but it is also a common phenomenon: if
the frequency changes from time to time within a wave its proﬁle can no longer be
a simple sine or cosine function. Therefore, any wave-proﬁle deformation from the
simple sinusoidal form implies the intrawave frequency modulation. In the past such
phenomena were treated as harmonic distortions. We will show in detail later that
most such deformations are better viewed as intrawave frequency modulation, for
the intrawave frequency modulation is more physical.
In order to use this unique deﬁnition of instantaneous frequency, we have to reduce
an arbitrary data set into IMF components from which an instantaneous frequency
value can be assigned to each IMF component. Consequently, for complicated data,
we can have more than one instantaneous frequency at a time locally. We will introduce the empirical mode decomposition method to reduce the data into the needed
5. The empirical mode decomposition method: the sifting process
Knowing the well-behaved Hilbert transforms of the IMF components is only the
starting point. Unfortunately, most of the data are not IMFs. At any given time, the
data may involve more than one oscillatory mode; that is why the simple Hilbert
transform cannot provide the full description of the frequency content for the general
data as reported by Long et al. . We have to decompose the data into IMF
components. Here, we will introduce a new method to deal with both non-stationary
and nonlinear data by decomposing the signal ﬁrst, and discuss the physical meaning of this decomposition later. Contrary to almost all the previous methods, this
new method is intuitive, direct, a posteriori and adaptive, with the basis of the
decomposition based on, and derived from, the data.
The decomposition is based on the assumptions: (1) the signal has at least two
extrema—one maximum and one minimum; (2) the characteristic time scale is
deﬁned by the time lapse between the extrema; and (3) if the data were totally
devoid of extrema but contained only inﬂection points, then it can be diﬀerentiated once or more times to reveal the extrema. Final results can be obtained by
integration(s) of the components.
The essence of the method is to identify the intrinsic oscillatory modes by their
characteristic time scales in the data empirically, and then decompose the data
accordingly. According to Drazin , the ﬁrst step of data analysis is to examine
the data by eye. From this examination, one can immediately identify the diﬀerent
scales directly in two ways: by the time lapse between the successive alternations of
local maxima and minima; and by the time lapse between the successive zero crossings. The interlaced local extrema and zero crossings give us the complicated data:
one undulation is riding on top of another, and they, in turn, are riding on still other
undulations, and so on. Each of these undulations deﬁnes a characteristic scale of the
data; it is intrinsic to the process. We have decided to adopt the time lapse between
successive extrema as the deﬁnition of the time scale for the intrinsic oscillatory
mode, because it not only gives a much ﬁner resolution of the oscillatory modes, but
also can be applied to data with non-zero mean, either all positive or all negative
values, without zero crossings. A systematic way to extract them, designated as the
sifting process, is described as follows.

line, with the upper and lower envelopes in dot-dashed lines and the mean in thick solid line;
(c) the diﬀerence between the data and m1. This is still not an IMF, for there are negative local
maxima and positive minima suggesting riding waves.
By virtue of the IMF deﬁnition, the decomposition method can simply use the
envelopes deﬁned by the local maxima and minima separately. Once the extrema are
identiﬁed, all the local maxima are connected by a cubic spline line as the upper
envelope. Repeat the procedure for the local minima to produce the lower envelope.
The upper and lower envelopes should cover all the data between them. Their mean is
designated as m1, and the diﬀerence between the data and m1 is the ﬁrst component,
X(t) −m1 = h1.
The procedure is illustrated in ﬁgures 3a–c (ﬁgure 3a gives the data; ﬁgure 3b gives
wind speed (ms–1)

result in ﬁgure 3c, the result is still asymmetric and still not a IMF; (b) after three siftings, the
result is much improved, but more sifting needed to eliminate the asymmetry. The ﬁnal IMF is
shown in ﬁgure 2 after nine siftings.
the data in the thin solid line, the upper and the lower envelopes in the dot-dashed
lines, and their mean in the thick solid line, which bisects the data very well; and ﬁgure 3c gives the diﬀerence between the data and the local mean as in equation (5.1)).
Ideally, h1 should be an IMF, for the construction of h1 described above seems to
have been made to satisfy all the requirements of IMF. In reality, however, overshoots
and undershoots are common, which can also generate new extrema, and shift or
exaggerate the existing ones. The imperfection of the overshoots and undershoots
can be found at the 4.6 and 4.7 s points in ﬁgure 3b. Their eﬀects, however, are
not direct, for it is the mean, not the envelopes, that will enter the sifting process.
Nevertheless, the problem is real. Even if the ﬁtting is perfect, a gentle hump on
a slope can be ampliﬁed to become a local extremum in changing the local zero
from a rectangular to a curvilinear coordinate system. An example can be found for
the hump between the 4.5 and 4.6 s range in the data in ﬁgure 3a. After the ﬁrst
round of sifting, the hump becomes a local maximum at the same time location as
in ﬁgure 3c. New extrema generated in this way actually recover the proper modes
lost in the initial examination. In fact, the sifting process can recover low-amplitude
riding waves with repeated siftings.
Still another complication is that the envelope mean may be diﬀerent from the
true local mean for nonlinear data; consequently, some asymmetric wave forms can
still exist no matter how many times the data are sifted. We have to accept this
approximation as discussed before.
Other than these theoretical diﬃculties, on the practical side, serious problems of
the spline ﬁtting can occur near the ends, where the cubic spline ﬁtting can have
large swings. Left by themselves, the end swings can eventually propagate inward and
corrupt the whole data span especially in the low-frequency components. We have
devised a numerical method to eliminate the end eﬀects; details will be given later.
At any rate, improving the spline ﬁtting is absolutely necessary. Even with these
problems, the sifting process can still extract the essential scales from the data.
The sifting process serves two purposes: to eliminate riding waves; and to make
the wave-proﬁles more symmetric. Toward this end, the sifting process has to be
repeated more times. In the second sifting process, h1 is treated as the data, then
h1 −m11 = h11.
Figure 4a shows the much improved result after the second sifting, but there are still
local maxima below the zero line. After another sifting, the result is given in ﬁgure 4b.
Now all the local maxima are positive, and all the local minima are negative, but
many waves are still asymmetric. We can repeat this sifting procedure k times, until
h1k is an IMF, that is
h1(k−1) −m1k = h1k,
the result is shown in ﬁgure 2 after nine siftings. Then, it is designated as
the ﬁrst IMF component from the data.
As described above, the process is indeed like sifting: to separate the ﬁnest local
mode from the data ﬁrst based only on the characteristic time scale. The sifting
process, however, has two eﬀects: (a) to eliminate riding waves; and (b) to smooth
uneven amplitudes.
While the ﬁrst condition is absolutely necessary for the instantaneous frequency to
be meaningful, the second condition is also necessary in case the neighbouring wave
amplitudes have too large a disparity. Unfortunately, the second eﬀect, when carried
to the extreme, could obliterate the physically meaningful amplitude ﬂuctuations.
Therefore, the sifting process should be applied with care, for carrying the process
to an extreme could make the resulting IMF a pure frequency modulated signal of
constant amplitude. To guarantee that the IMF components retain enough physical
sense of both amplitude and frequency modulations, we have to determine a criterion
for the sifting process to stop. This can be accomplished by limiting the size of the
standard deviation, SD, computed from the two consecutive sifting results as
|(h1(k−1)(t) −h1k(t))|2
A typical value for SD can be set between 0.2 and 0.3. As a comparison, the two
Fourier spectra, computed by shifting only ﬁve out of 1024 points from the same
data, can have an equivalent SD of 0.2–0.3 calculated point-by-point. Therefore, a
SD value of 0.2–0.3 for the sifting procedure is a very rigorous limitation for the
diﬀerence between siftings.
Overall, c1 should contain the ﬁnest scale or the shortest period component of the
signal. We can separate c1 from the rest of the data by
X(t) −c1 = r1.
Wind speed (ms–1)
Figure 5. Calibrated wind data from a wind-wave tunnel.
Since the residue, r1, still contains information of longer period components, it is
treated as the new data and subjected to the same sifting process as described
above. This procedure can be repeated on all the subsequent rjs, and the result is
r1 −c2 = r2, . . . , rn−1 −cn = rn.
The sifting process can be stopped by any of the following predetermined criteria:
either when the component, cn, or the residue, rn, becomes so small that it is less
than the predetermined value of substantial consequence, or when the residue, rn,
becomes a monotonic function from which no more IMF can be extracted. Even for
data with zero mean, the ﬁnal residue can still be diﬀerent from zero; for data with
a trend, then the ﬁnal residue should be that trend. By summing up equations (5.6)
and (5.7), we ﬁnally obtain
Thus, we achieved a decomposition of the data into n-empirical modes, and a residue,
rn, which can be either the mean trend or a constant. As discussed here, to apply the
EMD method, a mean or zero reference is not required; EMD only needs the locations
of the local extrema. The zero references for each component will be generated by
the sifting process. Without the need of the zero reference, EMD eliminates the
troublesome step of removing the mean values for the large DC term in data with
non-zero mean, an unexpected beneﬁt.
To illustrate the sifting process, we will use a set of wind data collected in a laboratory wind-wave tunnel with a high-frequency response Pitot
tube located 10 cm above the mean water level. The wind speed was recorded under
the condition of the initial onset of water waves from a calm surface. Calibrated
wind data are given in ﬁgure 5. Clearly, the data are quite complicated with many

original data and the components c1–c4; (b) the components c5–c9. Notice the last component,
c9, is not an IMF; it is the trend.
local extrema but no zero crossings, for the time series represents all positive numbers. Although the mean can be treated as a zero reference, deﬁning it is hard, for
the whole process is transient. This example illustrates the advantage of adopting
the successive extrema for deﬁning the time scale; it also illustrates the diﬃculties of
dealing with non-stationary data: even a meaningful mean is impossible to deﬁne, but
for EMD this diﬃculty is eliminated. Figures 6a, b summarize all the IMF obtained
from this repeated sifting processes. We have a total of nine components. Comparing
this with the traditional Fourier expansion, one can immediately see the eﬃciency
of the EMD: the expansion of a turbulence data set with only nine terms. From the
result, one can see a general separation of the data into locally non-overlapping time
scale components. In some components, such as c1 and c3, the signals are intermittent, then the neighbouring components might contain oscillations of the same scale,
but signals of the same time scale would never occur at the same locations in two
diﬀerent IMF components.
Finally, let us examine the physical meaning of each IMF component. The components of the EMD are usually physical, for the characteristic scales are physical.
Nevertheless, this is not strictly true, for there are cases when a certain scale of a
phenomenon is intermittent. Then, the decomposed component could contain two
scales in one IMF component. Therefore, the physical meaning of the decomposition
comes only in the totality of the decomposed components in the Hilbert spectrum.
Even with the entire set of decomposed components, sound physical interpretation
is still not guaranteed for other decompositions such as Fourier expansion. Further
discussions will be given later in detail. Having established the decomposition, we
should check the completeness and orthogonality of this decomposition. Because this
decomposition is a posteriori, the check should also be a posteriori.
6. Completeness and orthogonality
By virtue of the decomposition, completeness is given, for equation (5.8) is an
identity. As a check of the completeness for the wind data numerically, we can reconstruct the data from the IMF components starting from the longest to the shortest
periods in the sequence from ﬁgure 7a–j. Figure 7a gives the data and the longest
period component, c9, which is the residue trend, not an IMF. By itself, the ﬁtting of
the trend is quite impressive, and it is very physical: the gradual decrease of the mean
wind speed indicates the lack of drag from the calm surface initially and the increase
of drag after the generation of wind waves. As the mean wind speed decreases, the
amplitude of the ﬂuctuation increases, another indication of wind–wave interactions.
If we add the next longest period component, c8, the trend of the sum, c9 + c8, takes
a remarkable turn, and the ﬁtting to the data looks greatly improved as shown in
ﬁgure 7b. By successively adding more components with increasing frequency, we
have the results in the series of ﬁgures 7c–i. The gradual change from the monotonic
trend to the ﬁnal reconstruction is illustrative by itself. By the time we reach the
sum of IMF components up to c3 in ﬁgure 7g, we essentially have recovered all the
energy containing eddies already. The components with the highest frequencies add
little more energy, but they make the data look more complicated. In fact, the highest frequency component is probably not physical, for the digitizing rate of the Pitot
tube is too slow to capture the high-frequency variations. As a result, the data are
jagged artiﬁcially by the digitalizing steps at this frequency.

The diﬀerence between the reconstructed data from the sum of all the IMFs and
the original data is shown in ﬁgure 7j, in which the maximum amplitude is less
than 5 × 10−15, the roundoﬀerror from the precision of the computer. Thus, the
completeness is established both theoretically by equation (5.8), and numerically by
The orthogonality is satisﬁed in all practical sense, but it is not guaranteed theoretically. Let us discuss the practical aspect ﬁrst. By virtue of the decomposition, the
elements should all be locally orthogonal to each other, for each element is obtained
from the diﬀerence between the signal and its local mean through the maximal and
minimal envelopes; therefore,
(x(t) −x(t)) · x(t) = 0.
Nevertheless, equation (6.1) is not strictly true, because the mean is computed via
the envelopes, hence it is not the true mean. Furthermore, each successive IMF component is only part of the signal constituting x(t). Because of these approximations,
leakage is unavoidable. Any leakage, however, should be small.
The orthogonality of the EMD components should also be checked a posteriori
numerically as follows: let us ﬁrst write equation (5.8) as
in which we have included rn as an additional element. To check the orthogonality
of the IMFs from EMD, we deﬁne an index based on the most intuitive way: ﬁrst,

let us form the square of the signal as
Cj(t)Ck(t).
If the decomposition is orthogonal, then the cross terms given in the second part
on the right-hand side should be zero. With this expression, an overall index of
orthogonality, IO, is deﬁned as
Cj(t)Ck(t)/X2(t)
For the wind data given above, the IO value is only 0.0067. Orthogonality can also

be deﬁned for any two components, Cf and Cg. The measure of orthogonality will,
It should be noted that, although the deﬁnition of orthogonality seems to be global,
the real meaning here applies only locally. For some special data, the neighbouring
components could certainly have sections of data carrying the same frequency at
diﬀerent time durations. But locally, any two components should be orthogonal for
all practical purposes. The amount of leakage usually depends on the length of data as
well as the decomposition results. In reality, because of the ﬁnite data length, even
pure sinusoidal components with diﬀerent frequencies are not exactly orthogonal.
That is why the continuous wavelet in the most commonly used Morlet form suﬀers
severe leakage. For the EMD method, we found the leakage to be typically less than
1%. For extremely short data, the leakage could be as high as 5%, which is comparable
to that from a set of pure sinusoidal waves of the same data length.
Theoretically, the EMD method guarantees orthogonality only on the strength of
equation (6.1). Orthogonality actually depends on the decomposition method. Let us
consider two Stokian waves each having many harmonics. Separately, they are IMFs,
of course, and each represents a free travelling wave. If the frequency of one Stokian
wave coincides with the frequency of a harmonic of the other, then the two waves
are no longer orthogonal in the Fourier sense. EMD, however, can still separate
the two Stokian wave trains. Such a decomposition is physical, but the separated
IMF components are not orthogonal. Therefore, orthogonality is a requirement only
for linear decomposition systems; it would not make physical sense for a nonlinear
decomposition as in EMD. Fortunately, in most cases encountered, the leakage is
7. The Hilbert spectrum
Having obtained the intrinsic mode function components, we will have no diﬃculties in applying the Hilbert transform to each component, and computing the
instantaneous frequency according to equation (3.4). After performing the Hilbert
transform on each IMF component, we can express the data in the following form:
Here we have left out the residue, rn, on purpose, for it is either a monotonic function, or a constant. Although the Hilbert transform can treat the monotonic trend as
part of a longer oscillation, the energy involved in the residual trend could be overpowering. In consideration of the uncertainty of the longer trend, and in the interest
of information contained in the other low-energy and higher-frequency components,
the ﬁnal non-IMF component should be left out. It, however, could be included, if
physical considerations justify its inclusion.
Equation (7.1) gives both the amplitude and the frequency of each component as
functions of time. The same data if expanded in Fourier representation would be
with both aj and ωj constants. The contrast between equations (7.1) and (7.2) is
clear: the IMF represents a generalized Fourier expansion. The variable amplitude
and the instantaneous frequency have not only greatly improved the eﬃciency of
the expansion, but also enabled the expansion to accommodate non-stationary data.
With IMF expansion, the amplitude and the frequency modulations are also clearly
separated. Thus, we have broken through the restriction of the constant amplitude
and ﬁxed-frequency Fourier expansion, and arrived at a variable amplitude and frequency representation. This expression is numerical. If a function is more desired,
an empirical polynomial expression can be easily derived from the IMFs.
Equation (7.1) also enables us to represent the amplitude and the instantaneous
frequency as functions of time in a three-dimensional plot, in which the amplitude
can be contoured on the frequency–time plane. This frequency–time distribution of
the amplitude is designated as the Hilbert amplitude spectrum, H(ω, t), or simply
Hilbert spectrum. If amplitude squared is more desirable commonly to represent
energy density, then the squared values of amplitude can be substituted to produce
the Hilbert energy spectrum just as well.
Various forms of Hilbert spectra presentations can be made: the colour coded maps
and the contour maps all with or without smoothing. The Hilbert spectrum in the
colour map format for the wind data is given in ﬁgure 8. This spectrum gives a
very diﬀerent appearance in comparison with the corresponding wavelet spectrum
shown in ﬁgure 9. While the Hilbert spectrum appears only in the skeleton form
with emphasis on the frequency variations of each IMF, the Wavelet analysis result
gives a smoothed energy contour map with a rich distribution of higher harmonics.
If a more continuous form is preferred, two smoothing methods can be applied.
The ﬁrst one is to use a weighted spatial ﬁlter with which to average over a range
of cells. However, such a smoothing degrades both frequency and time resolutions.
If we applied this approach with large enough spatial averaging, we would get a
result similar to what the wavelet analysis would give. Even here, we still will not be
encumbered by the many spurious harmonics as in the Fourier-based wavelet analysis.
For example, a 15 × 15 weighted Gaussian ﬁlter will give the smoothed spectrum as
in ﬁgure 10, which gives a better resemblance to the wavelet result, though not
necessarily a better physical interpretation than the original, for the information
content has been degraded. In the smoothed form, however, the energy density and
its trends of evolution as functions of frequency and time are easier to identify. In
general, if more quantitative results are desired, the original skeleton presentation is
better; if more qualitative results are desired, the smoothed presentation is better.
As a guide, the ﬁrst look of the data is better in the smoothed format.
The alternative to the spatial smoothing is to select a lower frequency resolution
and leave the time axis undisturbed. The advantage of this approach is the preservation of events’ locations, but gives a more continuous frequency variation. Furthermore, with low-frequency resolution, we also save some computation time. The
optimal frequency resolution in the Hilbert spectrum can be computed as follows.
Let the total data length be T, and the digitizing rate be ∆t. Then the lowest
frequency one can extract from the data is 1/T Hz, which is also the limit of frequency
resolution for the data. The highest frequency one can extract from the data is
1/(n∆t) Hz, in which n represents the minimum number of ∆t needed to deﬁne the
frequency accurately. Since the Hilbert transform deﬁnes instantaneous frequency by
diﬀerentiation, we do need more data points to deﬁne an oscillation. The absolute
minimum number of data points is ﬁve for a whole sine wave. We do not need a whole
sine wave to deﬁne its frequency, but we do need many points within any part of the
wave to get a stable derivative. Therefore, the maximum number of the frequency
cells, N, of the Hilbert spectrum should be
N = (1/n∆t)
In order to make the derivative stable, we have averaged over three adjacent cell
values for the ﬁnal presentation. The wind data, digitized at a rate of 0.01 s, has a
total length of 30 s. Therefore, the highest frequency we can extract is 25 Hz. The
total cell size could be 600 but they have been averaged to 200 as used in ﬁgure 8.
With the Hilbert spectrum deﬁned, we can also deﬁne the marginal spectrum,
H(ω, t) dt.
In ﬁgure 11 the solid line gives the corresponding marginal spectrum of the Hilbert
spectrum given in ﬁgure 8. The marginal spectrum oﬀers a measure of total amplitude
(or energy) contribution from each frequency value. It represents the cumulated
amplitude over the entire data span in a probabilistic sense. As pointed out by Huang
et al. , the frequency in either H(ω, t) or h(ω) has a totally diﬀerent meaning
from the Fourier spectral analysis. In the Fourier representation, the existence of
energy at a frequency, ω, means a component of a sine or a cosine wave persisted
Figure 11. The comparison of the marginal Hilbert spectrum (the solid line) and the Fourier spectrum (the dotted line) all from the same wind data. The Fourier spectrum is dominated by the

of the data.
through the time span of the data. Here, the existence of energy at the frequency,
ω, means only that, in the whole time span of the data, there is a higher likelihood
for such a wave to have appeared locally. In fact, the Hilbert spectrum is a weighted
non-normalized joint amplitude–frequency–time distribution. The weight assigned
to each time–frequency cell is the local amplitude. Consequently, the frequency in
the marginal spectrum indicates only the likelihood that an oscillation with such
a frequency exists. The exact occurrence time of that oscillation is given in the full
Hilbert spectrum. The corresponding Fourier spectrum of the wind data is also given
in ﬁgure 11 in a dotted line. There is little similarity between the Fourier spectrum
and the marginal spectrum. While the Fourier spectrum is dominated by the DC
term because of the non-zero mean wind speed, the marginal spectrum gives a nearly
continuous distribution of energy. The Fourier spectrum is meaningless physically,
for the data is not stationary.
In addition to the marginal spectrum, we can also deﬁne the instantaneous energy
density level, IE, as
H2(ω, t) dω.
Obviously, this IE also depends on time; it can be used to check the energy ﬂuctuation.
With the energy–frequency–time distribution given, we can discuss the deﬁnition
of stationarity quantitatively now. As we stated in the introduction, the classic deﬁ-

nitions of stationarity given in equations (1.1) and (1.2) are dichotomous: a process
is either stationary or non-stationary, the description is only qualitative. Such deﬁnitions are both stringent and useless at the same time: few data sets can satisfy the
rigour of these deﬁnitions; consequently, no one even bothers using them for checking
the stationarity. As a result, data as non-stationary as earthquake and seismological signals are routinely treated as stationary .
Sometimes, for some obvious non-stationary data, two less stringent deﬁnitions are
invoked: the piecewise stationary; and the asymptotically stationary. These deﬁnitions are still dichotomous. To quantify the statistical processes further, an index
is needed to give a quantitative measure of how far the process deviates from stationarity; a prerequisite for such a deﬁnition is a method to present the data in
the frequency–time space. Now, having established the Hilbert spectrum, we can
introduce the index of stationarity as follows.
The ﬁrst step to deﬁne the degree of stationarity, DS(ω), is to ﬁnd the mean
marginal spectrum, n(ω), as
Then, the degree of stationarity is deﬁned as
1 −H(ω, t)
in which the integrand is similar to the intermittency deﬁned in the wavelet analysis.
We decided to adopt the integration representation because it gives a quantitative
wind speed (ms–1)

measure of the whole data set. Obviously, for a stationary process, the Hilbert spectrum cannot be a function of time. Then, the Hilbert spectrum will consist of only
horizontal contour lines; DS(ω) will then be identically zero. Only under this condition will the marginal spectrum be identical to the Fourier spectrum, then the
Fourier spectrum will also make physical sense. If the Hilbert spectrum depends on
time, the index will not be zero, then the Fourier spectrum will cease to make physical sense. The higher the index value, the more non-stationary is the process. The
DS for the wind data is shown in ﬁgure 12. As the index shows, the data are highly
non-stationary especially for the high-frequency components.
Equation (7.7) deﬁnes the stationarity as a function of frequency. This is necessary, for certain frequency components can be non-stationary while other components
remain stationary. An example is the sporadic riding wind waves on otherwise uniform swell: the low-frequency swell component is stationary, while the high-frequency
wind waves are intermittent, and hence non-stationary.
The degree of stationarity can also be a function of time implicitly, for the deﬁnition depends on the time length of integration in equations (7.6) and (7.7). Therefore,
a process can be piecewise stationary. On the other hand, for a singular outburst in
an otherwise stationary signal, the process can be regarded as almost stationary if
we take a long time integral, but non-stationary if we look at the immediate neighbourhood of the outburst. Stationarity can be a complicated property of the process:
for any data shorter than a typical long wave period, the process may look transient,
yet as the data length gets longer, the process can have many longer wave periods
and becomes stationary. On the other hand the data can be locally stationary while
in a long time sense non-stationary. An index is therefore not only useful but also
necessary to quantify the process and give a measure of the stationarity.
The degree of stationarity deﬁned in equation (7.7) can be modiﬁed slightly to
include the statistically stationary signals, for which the degree of statistic stationarity, DSS(ω, ∆T), is deﬁned as
DSS(ω, ∆T) = 1
1 −H(ω, t)
where the overline indicates averaging over a deﬁnite but shorter time span, ∆T, than
the overall time duration of the data, T. For periodic motions, the ∆T can be the
period. Such a time scale, however, is hard to deﬁne precisely for high-dimensional
non-stationary dynamic systems. Even with this diﬃculty, the deﬁnition for DSS
could be more useful in characterizing random variables from natural phenomena.
Obviously, DSS will depend on both frequency and the averaging time span. For the
wind data taken as an example, the DSS with ∆T as a parameter is given in ﬁgure 12
with ∆T = 10, 50, 100 and 300 time steps, respectively. The results show that
while the high-frequency components are non-stationary, they can still be statistically
stationary. Two frequency bands at 7 and 17 Hz are highly non-stationary as the DSS
averaged at 100 time steps shows in ﬁgure 13a. These components are intermittent
as can be seen in the IMF components and the marginal spectrum. A section of the
original wind data is also plotted in ﬁgure 13b to demonstrate that there are indeed
prominent 7 and 17 Hz time scale oscillations.
8. Validation and calibration of the Hilbert spectrum
Through the empirical mode decomposition and the associated Hilbert spectral
analysis we obtained the probabilistic Hilbert spectrum representation of the nonstationary data. Now, we will validate the approach and the results, and calibrate
its ﬁdelity compared with the best existing method, the wavelet analysis. Before
proceeding further, let us ﬁrst examine the physical meaning of EMD.
Historically, there are two important methods to expand a function in series: the
Taylor and the Fourier expansions, both powerful but based on totally diﬀerent
approaches. The Taylor series for a function, f(t), is expanded near a point, t0, as
f(t + t0) = f(t0) + f ′(t0)(t −t0) + f ′′(t0) 1
2(t −t0)2 + · · · + f (n)(t0)((t −t0)n/n!) + · · · ,
in which the primes and (n) indicate the order of diﬀerentiation. The Fourier expansion for the same function is expanded globally as,
in which the coeﬃcients, aj, are given by
f(t)e−iωjt dt.
From equations (8.1) and (8.2), the diﬀerent mathematical principles in deriving the
expansions are quite clear. While the Taylor expansion is based on the properties of
frequency (s)

localized in time and frequency, though there are some end eﬀects. (c) The Morlet wavelet
spectrum for the calibration signal: the calibration signal is localized by the high-frequency
components, yet the energy distribution in the frequency space spreads widely in comparison
with the Hilbert spectrum.
the function at a point through diﬀerentiation, the Fourier expansion is based on the
properties of the function over the whole time span through integration. Although
both expansions are valid within the range of convergency, there are diﬀerent requirements on each function: one of the necessary conditions for the Taylor expansion to
exist is that the function has to be analytic to the nth order. Such a restriction is not
necessary for the Fourier expansion, which can be applied to functions with denumerable ﬁnite jumps. The Fourier expansion introduces a powerful idea: to expand
a function with any orthogonal and complete basis. Therefore, there are inﬁnitely
many ways to decompose a signal. For example, a signal can be decomposed into
simple harmonic components with the Fourier transform. By the same token, the
same signal can also be decomposed into Hermite polynomials, or some other special
functions such as Legendre or Laguerre polynomials. In fact any collection of orthogonal functions can serve as the basis for a decomposition for a linear system. Once we
have a complete and orthogonal basis, the expansion is mathematically correct even
for a transient nonlinear system, as testiﬁed by the results produced by the classical
perturbation analysis for nonlinear diﬀerential equations. Whether this mathematically correct expansion also makes physical sense is entirely a separate, but crucial,
problem. In general, we believe the answer provided by any linear expansion for a
nonlinear system, such as the answer obtained by the perturbation method, should
not make physical sense. This conclusion can be argued from two diﬀerent direc-

tions: ﬁrst, a nonlinear system does not admit an answer by superposition; second,
the perturbation method is forcing a linear approximation on a nonlinear system.
Both of the above arguments are true; therefore, it is fortuitous to have the sum of
the linear system to approximate the full nonlinear system. It is entirely diﬀerent to
also ask each individual component in the linear system to have physical meaning
related to the full nonlinear system.
EMD expansion is at the same time both diﬀerent from and similar to the above
expansions. It is based on both integration, as in the Hilbert transform given in
equation (3.1), and diﬀerentiation, as in the instantaneous frequency given in equation (3.4). The integration in the Hilbert transform is not exactly global, for it is
the convolution of the function with 1/t, which makes the result extremely local.
Essentially, the Hilbert transform gives the best ﬁt with a sinusoidal function to the
data weighted by 1/t.
Let us compare how local the Hilbert transform can be with the result from wavelet
analysis by considering an isolated sine wave given in ﬁgure 14a. With wavelet analysis we get the spectrum in ﬁgure 14c, in which the event is well deﬁned on the time
axis by the high-frequency components, even though the event is a low-frequency
wave. In the result, neither the energy density nor the frequency is well localized;
they give a counter-intuitive interpretation of the wavelet spectrum: to look for deﬁnition of a low-frequency event in the high-frequency range. When the same data are
treated by the Hilbert spectral analysis, we have the result in ﬁgure 14b, in which the
frequency (Hz)

fundamental and the harmonics around 0.03 and 0.06 Hz as expected from the traditional view.
The end eﬀect of the wavelet analysis is clearly visible.
energy is well localized in both frequency and time domains. This simple example
illustrates the unique property of the Hilbert spectrum in elimination of the spurious
harmonic components to represent the non-stationary data.
Next, let us examine the validity and the implication of the instantaneous frequency for nonlinear data through the idealized Stokes wave in deep water, which is
a classic example of using harmonic components to represent nonlinear wave form
distortion . It is also the ﬁrst successful application of
the perturbation method to solve a nonlinear analytic equation system for a natural
phenomenon. To second order, the proﬁle is given by
2a2k + a cos ωt + 1
2a2k cos 2ωt + · · · ,
in which a is the amplitude and k is the wave number. For a = 1, ak = 0.2, and ω =
32 Hz, the wave-proﬁle is shown in ﬁgure 15a. Because of the harmonic distortion,
the wave form shows sharpened crests and rounded-oﬀtroughs, which make the
crests and troughs asymmetric with respect to the mean surface. Processed with
EMD, these data yield only one IMF component, shown also in ﬁgure 15b, with
a constant oﬀset component not shown. The Stokes wave is deformed due to the
harmonic distortion; it is asymmetric with respect to the mean, while the IMF is
symmetric. Although this wave has only one characteristic scale, the wavelet analysis
result shown in ﬁgure 16 gives two bands of energy. The IMF data can be processed
immediately to give the Hilbert spectrum as shown in ﬁgure 17, which has only one
frequency band centred around 0.03 Hz, the fundamental frequency of the wave train,

intrawave frequency modulation interpretation of the Stokes wave is clear. In the Hilbert spectrum the frequency variation is bounded in a narrow range around 0.03 Hz with no harmonics.
but there is an intrawave frequency modulation with a magnitude range of 0.02–
0.04 Hz. This intrawave frequency modulation has been totally ignored in the past,
for the traditional deﬁnition of frequency is based on the reciprocal of periodicity.
Consequently, the notion of intrawave frequency modulation cannot be represented
or discussed. Is the intrawave frequency modulation meaningful? What is its physical
signiﬁcance? To answer these questions, let us consider a simple model wave given
X(t) = cos(ωt + ǫ sin ωt).
Figure 18a gives the proﬁle of this wave together with the cosine wave given by the
dotted line. This wave shows the harmonic distortion similar to the Stokes wave
given in ﬁgure 15a: sharpened crests and rounded-oﬀtroughs. In the past, this kind
of wave form has been treated as a typical case of harmonic distortion. Indeed, the
second-order approximation of equation (8.5) is
X(t) = cos(ωt + ǫ sin ωt)
= cos ωt cos(ǫ sin ωt) −sin ωt sin(ǫ sin ωt)
≈cos ωt −ǫsin2ωt ≈(1 −1
2ǫ) cos ωt + 1
2ǫ cos 2ωt.
This expression is very similar to the one given in equation (8.4).
Equation (8.6), however, is only an approximation to the full expression of equa-

tion (8.5), which satisﬁes the following highly nonlinear diﬀerential equation:†
dt2 + (ω + ǫω cos ωt)2x −ǫω2 sin ωt(1 −x2)1/2 = 0.
Although this equation bears no relationship to the system generating the Stokes
wave, the example illustrates that harmonic components are the results of using
a linear system to simulate the nonlinear one. Although the ﬁnal solution form is
similar to the real one, the harmonic components have no physical meaning other
than providing better mathematical approximation.
As given in equation (8.5), the function is clearly a frequency modulated wave
with the modulating frequency equal to that of the main oscillating frequency. The
frequency given by the classic wave theory for this model wave is
dt = ω(1 + ǫ cos ωt).
With ω = 1 Hz and ǫ = 0.5, the frequency values are plotted in ﬁgure 18b, with the
solid line representing the values given by the Hilbert transform and equation (3.4),
and the dotted line representing the values given in equation (8.8). Both methods
give similar variation of the frequency with only minor deviation at the extreme

spectrum has much better frequency deﬁnition, and the amplitude-variation-induced frequency
modulation is small.
should be interpreted as an intrawave frequency modulated wave; it is more physical.
To illustrate the non-physical representation using harmonics, let us consider the
water-wave problem again. Traditionally, the gravity water waves have always been
represented by the harmonics to account for the nonlinear distortion. The inclusion of
the harmonics, however, introduced a diﬃculty: not all components follow the same
dispersion relationship. As a result, we are forced to divide the components into the
‘free’ and the ‘forced’ waves. The ‘free’ waves are the fundamentals that follow the
dispersion relationship; the ‘forced’ waves are the harmonics that are bound to the
fundamentals. In a wave spectrum, one cannot clearly separate the ‘free’ from the
‘forced’ unless the wave is monochromatic. This division is a consequence of using a
linear system to approximate the nonlinear one; it is totally artiﬁcial. We will return
to this point later with more examples.
Now let us examine the data analysis results from diﬀerent methods: The wavelet
analysis result for the model data given in equation (8.5) is shown in ﬁgure 19a, while
the Hilbert spectrum is shown in ﬁgure 19b. Comparison between the wavelet analysis
and Hilbert spectra pairs in ﬁgures 19a versus 19b shows that the intrawave frequency
modulation is a new and better physical interpretation for the energy–frequency–time
distribution for the Stokian waves. The diﬀerence is again clear: the Hilbert spectrum
clearly resolves the intrawave frequency modulation, while the wavelet result gives
Figure 23. The comparisons among the Fourier (dotted line), marginal Hilbert (solid line) and
wavelet spectra (dashed line): it is obvious that the end eﬀects and the leakage of the wavelet
analysis renders the marginal spectrum almost useless. Even the Fourier spectrum is sharper
than the marginal wavelet spectrum, but it totally failed to show the time variation of the signal.
The marginal Hilbert is still sharp to deﬁne the carrier frequency.
a smeared average frequency range over which the main wave energy resides. There
is a total lack of detail beyond this smoothed mean, which is to be expected, for
the wavelet determines the frequency based on the Fourier transform in a window
with 5.5 waves. Any change shorter than this window will be obscured. Other than
the lack of details, Fourier-based analysis also spreads energy to the high-frequency
range as the harmonics. Traditionally, these harmonics are viewed as a matter of
fact, but the new method here reveals that the Fourier expansion is a mathematical
approximation to a nonlinear physical process, in which the true physical meaning
is beyond the reach of Fourier-based analysis.
The above examples have not only validated the EMD and the Hilbert spectrum
representation, but also clariﬁed the conditions under which the spurious harmonics
are generated in the Fourier-based analysis: nonlinearity and non-stationarity. The
nonlinear case is illustrated by the Stokes waves, and the non-stationary case by the
single sine wave. By comparison, this nonlinear distortion of the wave form causes
much fewer serious non-physical harmonic terms in Fourier analysis than the nonstationary data. In the past, this crucial problem has not been addressed. Typically,
the perturbation analysis gives a solution in series expansion. Each term is the solution of a linear equation. Although the inﬁnite series expansion is so powerful that
it can approximate some transient phenomena with uniform amplitude components,
their physical meaning has never been examined critically. The mathematical success
has obscured our physical insights.
To illustrate the cause of intrawave frequency modulation further, let us consider
an example of an amplitude modulated wave given by
x = exp(−0.01t) cos 2
for t from 1–512 s. The wave form is given in ﬁgure 20. Since this wave is already an
IMF, there is no need for invoking EMD. The Hilbert spectrum of the data is shown
in ﬁgure 21. Clearly, the amplitude has introduced a 1.5% instantaneous frequency
modulation around the mean of the carrier frequency. This frequency modulation
should not be a surprise, equation (3.11) has already indicated that amplitude variations could cause a frequency ﬂuctuation, but not a change of the mean. The uneven
range of the frequency modulation is caused by the Gibbs phenomenon through the
Hilbert transform. To get a realistic appraisal of the ﬂuctuation range, the same
data are processed by the Morlet wavelet analysis with the result given in ﬁgure 22,
in which the Hilbert spectrum is superimposed in contour lines for comparison. On
this scale, the frequency modulation in the Hilbert spectrum appears as a single thin
line. The wavelet results not only spread the frequency over a wide range, but also
contain severe end eﬀects caused by the Gibbs phenomenon. To explore the diﬀerences among the various spectral representations further, the marginal Hilbert and
wavelet spectra are plotted together with the Fourier spectrum in ﬁgure 23. One can
immediately see the sharpness of the Hilbert marginal spectrum in its deﬁnition of
the mean frequency. In this case, the Fourier (dotted line) is actually sharper than
the marginal wavelet spectrum, though the Fourier spectrum has totally missed the
amplitude variation as a function of time. The spreading of energy in the wavelet
analysis is due both to the leakage and the end eﬀects. In all fairness, it should be
noted that the marginal spectrum for a non-stationary time series does not make
sense. This example only intends to make a reference to the Fourier analysis. More
importantly, this example also demonstrates that, while amplitude variation can
cause intrawave modulation, the eﬀects of amplitude-induced intrawave modulation
are negligible compared with the nonlinear distortion.
Finally, let us examine the resolution power of the EMD and Hilbert spectral analysis by the following examples. First, let us consider the case of a simple cosine wave
with one frequency suddenly switching to another frequency as shown in ﬁgure 24a,
the classic example used in many reports to illustrate the power of wavelet analysis in
frequency–time distributions. The standard Morlet wavelet analysis clearly identiﬁes
the local frequency before and after the frequency switch as well as the location of the
frequency switch as in ﬁgure 24b. At the same time, the result also shows the leakage
of the energy to the neighbouring modes, and the smearing of the precise time location of the frequency switch event in the lower-frequency range. Figure 24c shows the
result of Hilbert spectral analysis from the same data. Here we can see much sharper
frequency deﬁnitions and the time location of the frequency switch than those shown
in ﬁgure 24b. Although the ﬁnite data length and the sharp frequency change both
contribute to some oscillation of the frequency in the Hilbert spectrum due to the
Gibbs phenomena, the range of variation is insigniﬁcant compared with the leakage
in the wavelet analysis result.
Second, let us consider the case of the linear sum of two cosine waves as
x(t) = cos 2
30πt + cos 2
again over t from 1–512 s, with the wave form given in ﬁgure 25. The slight asymmetric wave form suggests that the EMD method has to be used. If the sifting process

processes, the components failed to give the exact constant amplitudes and frequencies, a ﬂaw
due to the accumulation of errors from the imperfect spline ﬁttings in the sifting processes.

is used with limited number of siftings as in the regular problems, no IMF will be
produced, for the data are already an IMF to the ﬁrst order of approximation. To
force the EMD to extract diﬀerent components, an extremely stringent criterion is
invoked here. After up to 3000 siftings, EMD produces eight components from the
data. The ﬁrst four are shown in ﬁgure 26. As one can see, the ﬁrst two components
carry most of the energy. They represent the
30 Hz (17 waves in the given time span)
32 Hz (15 waves) components, respectively. Comparisons of the sums of the ﬁrst
two and the ﬁrst four components with the full data are given in ﬁgure 27. The
diﬀerence between the two-term sum and the data is already small; the diﬀerence
between the four-term sum and the data is negligible except near the ends.
From the IMFs, the Hilbert spectrum is constructed and presented in contour lines
in ﬁgure 28, in which the Morlet wavelet spectrum from the same data is also given
in colour. The agreement between the two methods is obvious. Again, the wavelet
result shows severe leakage. Neither method shows two distinct linear components;
both methods treated the beats as an amplitude modulation wave. Figure 29 gives
the marginal spectra from both Hilbert and Morlet wavelet spectra, together with
the Fourier spectrum. From this ﬁgure, it is clear that none of the three methods
can separate the peaks of the two linear components. For this linear and stationary
case the wavelet performs the worst. Although EMD succeeded in extracting the
two components, the IMFs have been severely contaminated through the thousands
of spline ﬁtting in the siftings. As a result, the instantaneous frequencies of the
Figure 29. The comparisons between the Fourier (dotted line), marginal Hilbert (solid line) and
wavelet spectra (dashed line): the Fourier spectrum should give the true frequency distribution,
but it also failed to separate the frequency of the two components. It does, however, give a clear
deﬁnition of the range of their frequencies. It is obvious that the leakage of the wavelet analysis
renders the marginal spectrum almost useless. The marginal Hilbert is still sharp to deﬁne the
mean frequency, but also fails to separate the components.
components become overlapped to form a single peak located near the mean value.
The Fourier spectrum, though, also fails to separate the components for this short
data span that we have here, it can clearly deﬁne the frequencies by repeated folding
of the data to increase the total data span. Longer data will certainly help the EMD
by limiting the end eﬀects, but the key problem is not the data length but spline
ﬁtting. Unless and until a better spline ﬁtting is implemented, EMD will not be able
to improve the instantaneous frequency deﬁnition in this case. Using the higher-order
spline with a condition on higher-order continuity will certainly improve the result.
Before then, the Fourier analysis, but not the Wavelet, should be used for the known
stationary time series.
With these idealized examples, we have established the validity and the limitations
of the Hilbert spectral analysis. Next, we will present some applications in numerically computed results from low-dimensional nonlinear equations, and some data
from observations.
9. Applications
In this section, we will demonstrate applications through a number of examples
roughly divided into two categories: the ﬁrst category contains numerical solutions
from some low-dimensional classical nonlinear equations; the second category contains the applications to speciﬁc natural phenomena and laboratory data that include
wave data from both the laboratory and the ﬁeld, the equatorial region ocean surface
elevation measured by altimeter, earthquake records and turbulence. In all the cases,
the EMD and Hilbert spectral analysis will oﬀer physical insight.
(a ) Numerical results from classic nonlinear systems
We will ﬁrst present some examples on classic nonlinear systems. The advantage
of studying these systems is their simplicity, yet they contain all the essentials of the
possible nonlinear eﬀects. All these systems have been studied extensively; therefore,
most of their dynamic characteristics are familiar, though the detailed physics may
not necessarily be well appreciated. Using them as examples with the new method,
we can contrast the diﬀerent views and gain new insights, which will also help us in
interpreting more complicated cases in high-degrees-of-freedom natural phenomena.
(i) Duﬃng equation
The Duﬃng equation is one of the simplest nonlinear equations with the form,
dt2 + x + ǫx3 = γ cos ωt,
in which ǫ is a small parameter, γ is the amplitude of the oscillatory driving force
with a basic frequency ω. The homogeneous part of the equation has the unperturbed
Hamiltonian,
in which ˙x is the time derivative of x. For ǫ = −1; the intrinsic frequency can
be shown to be 0.124 Hz. Traditionally, Duﬃng’s equation has been solved by the
perturbation method with the solution expressed as
a series of the basic frequency and all its superharmonics. Such a solution is no doubt
correct mathematically, for the perturbation method generates the superharmonics
to approximate the highly deformed wave form due to the nonlinearity as
x(t) = cos ωt + ǫ cos 3ωt + ǫ2 cos 6ωt + · · · .
This solution from the perturbation method is a typical example of approximating a
nonlinear system with a collection of linear ones. Collectively, they show the correct
wave-proﬁle, but neither collectively nor individually will the components give any
physically meaningful representation of the full nonlinear system. Equation (9.1),
however, can be rewritten as
dt2 + x(1 + ǫx2) = γ cos ωt.
In this form, it oﬀers a clearer physical interpretation of the equation: it can be
viewed as representing a simple spring–mass system with a forcing function. The
spring constant, however, is not a constant, but varies with position of the mass.
The equation can equally be viewed as representing a pendulum with a forcing function. The pendulum length, however, is not constant, but varies with the angle of
the swing. Either of these views suggests that the oscillation is not one of a constant frequency within a period. And the changing of spring constant or the length
of the pendulum calls for local change of ‘instantaneous frequency’, an intrawave
frequency modulation. This conception of intrawave frequency modulation clearly
makes physical sense from equation (9.4). It oﬀers more detailed information than
the Hamiltonian system, in which the averaged frequency is deﬁned as
∂t = ∂H(J)
with J as the averaged action density deﬁned by
in which θ is the angular variable, p and q are the generalized momentum and
the coordinate respectively, and H is the total Hamiltonian in terms of the action
density variable. In these canonical expressions, the most important parameter is the
averaged period or frequency, based on which the Poincar´e section and the modern
topological view of the dynamic system are built. With such a view, the shape of
the phase plane is not as important as the time needed to trace a full cycle. As long
as they are closed curves, they are topologically equivalent. Yet the diﬀerent shapes
of the phase curves represent the diﬀerent details of the oscillations. Such details
can only be represented by the instantaneous frequency, as will be shown presently.
The motion described by equation (9.4) clearly requires the instantaneous frequency
variation to specify its full physical details.
Now let us examine a speciﬁc example by taking γ = 0.1; ǫ = −1; ω =
and the initial conditions: {x(0); x′(0)} = {1, 1}. Numerically integrating equations
(9.1) and (9.4) give the solutions for x(t) and x′(t) in ﬁgure 30 with the phase plane
presentation in ﬁgure 31. Two features stand out from the phase diagram. First,
the phase diagram shows continuous winding, an indication of no ﬁxed period for
the oscillation. Second, the shape of the phase diagram is strongly deformed from a
simple circle, which gives both the sharp peaks and troughs in the time series data.
The sharpness of the peaks and the troughs requires the Fourier expansion of the
solution to contain many harmonics.
When subjected to the EMD, this numerical result yields only three prominent
IMF components as shown in ﬁgure 32: a uniform amplitude high-frequency component representing the intrinsic frequency of the system; a uniform intermediate
frequency component representing the forcing function; and a low-frequency component representing the very low-intensity subharmonics. The ﬁrst, and most energetic,
component is highly deformed from the simple sinusoidal proﬁle, a clear indication of
the nonlinear nature of the oscillator. Yet, this component represents a physical entity, and is treated as such by the EMD, a clear indication that the EMD can indeed
analyse nonlinear data. In the Hilbert spectrum given in ﬁgure 33, the intrinsic frequency shows strong intrawave frequency modulation, which is presented as variable
frequency oscillating between 0.06 and 0.18 Hz, with a weighted mean around 0.1 Hz,
the averaged frequency as predicted by the Hamiltonian method. The detailed variations of the intrinsic frequency indicate that it contains both inter- and intrawave
frequency modulations. The forcing function is also clearly shown with the expected
frequency. The only unexpected component is the low-frequency and low-amplitude
signal. It represents the slow aperiodic wobbling of the phase; therefore, it is real.
Although an explanation is needed for its generation and its physical signiﬁcance,
its existence has been reported by Kevorkian .
When the same data are treated with the Morlet wavelet analysis with the same
total number of frequency resolutions, the results are given in ﬁgure 34. The richness
of the harmonics is generated by the sharpness of the wave crests and troughs.

frequency modulated oscillation and two low-frequency oscillations. The intermediate frequency
component is the forcing function.
Although the forcing function and the intrinsic frequency are still discernible as wide
belts of energy concentration, all the details of the intrinsic frequency variations are
totally lost.
To show that the highest frequency IMF is indeed intrawave modulated, let us
consider the following mathematical model:
X(t) = cos(ωt + ǫ sin 2ωt).
According to the classic wave theory, this expression is a clear case of intrawave
frequency modulation similar to that of the Stokes waves. Using the same expansion
as in equation (8.6), one can show that equation (9.7) can be reduced to
X(t) ≈(1 −1
2ǫ) cos ωt + 1
2ǫ cos 3ωt + · · · ,
which is the second-order approximation of the series solution for the Duﬃng equa-

tion. For ǫ = 0.3 and ω =
64 Hz, the wave-proﬁle represented by equation (9.7) is
given in ﬁgure 35 with the frequency computed from either the Hilbert transform
through equation (3.4) and the classic wave theory. The diﬀerences are caused by
the leakage of energy into the negative frequency range, but the overall agreements
are still clear. Here again we have two views for the same mathematical expression.
The one based on the classic wave theory is the more physical one. It calls for an
intrawave frequency modulation.
Now, let us use the Hilbert spectrum and the wavelet analysis methods on this
expression. The results are shown in ﬁgures 36 and 37, respectively. The Hilbert
spectrum clearly shows the intrawave modulation, in agreement with the classic wave
theory, while the wavelet result is encumbered by the harmonics. Thus, we prove
again that intrawave frequency modulation is physical. This simple example again
illustrates that the instantaneous frequency, with intrawave frequency modulation
deﬁned by the EMD and Hilbert spectrum, does make physical sense. In fact, such
an instantaneous frequency presentation actually reveals more details of the system:
it reveals the variation of the frequency within one period, a view never seen before.
Again, the wavelet result spreads energy over a much wider frequency range, but
fails to give any true detailed frequency variations.
Based on the new idea of intrawave frequency modulation, one can easily pick
out the minute variations of the waves in the IMF component and in the original
data computed from the Duﬃng equation. With the Hilbert spectrum as a guide,

wave theory and equation (3.4) (dotted line).
the unevenness of the intrawave frequency variation can be shown to have one-to-one
correspondence with the variations of the data. This observation is consistent with
the non-repeating phase function as in ﬁgure 31. In ﬁgure 33, a much lower frequency
of the forcing function at 0.04 Hz is also clearly shown. Additionally, we can also see a
faint suggestion of still lower frequency subharmonics reported by Kevorkian .
(ii) Lorenz equation
The famous Lorenz equation was proposed initially to study deterministic non-periodic ﬂow. It can be regarded as the starting point of the modern
chaos investigation. The standard form of the Lorenz equation is
˙x = −σx + σy,
˙y = rx −y −xz,
˙z = −bz + xy,
in which σ, r and b are positive constant parameters. The Lorenz system is dissipative; therefore, it is not a Hamiltonian system. The divergence of the velocity
∂z = −(σ + b + 1) < 0,
therefore, the volume of the ﬂuid will eventually tend to zero, suggesting that the
system has an attractor or attractors.
With σ = 10, b = 3, r = 20, this system has three stationary points: (0, 0, 0),
(√57, √57, 19) and (−√57, −√57, 19). From the initial position of (10, 0, 0), the

intrawave modulation is represented by the non-physical harmonics located at 0.05 Hz.

equation with σ = 10, b = 3, r = 20 and the initial position of (10, 0, 0).

solution; (b) the Fourier spectrum for the x-component. Since the data are transient, the wide

(−√57, −√57, 19) as shown in ﬁgure 38. The x-component and its Fourier spectrum are shown in ﬁgure 39. The Fourier spectrum shows a sharp peak at 1.4 Hz and

its harmonics at 2.8 Hz. Additionally, there are broad energy distributions in order
to simulate the transient property of the signal. A Morlet wavelet analysis result of
the same signal, shown in ﬁgure 40, reveals the transient property of the signal, the
harmonic components and the edge eﬀects. As discussed previously, the transient
property of the data indicates that the Fourier spectrum is useless here.
The EMD, when applied to the signal, yields two IMF components: both transient, but with totally diﬀerent frequencies and damping characteristics as shown in
ﬁgure 41. The Hilbert spectrum is given in ﬁgure 42, in which we can see an oscillation with a frequency centred around 1.4 Hz and a low-frequency relaxation, again
a surprise as in the Duﬃng system. All these variations can be seen through the
linearized equation near (−√57, −√57, 19), which gives the following eigenvalues:
−13.56−0.22+9.17i, and −0.22−9.17i. Notice that 9.17/2π = 1.46 Hz, which is the
main oscillating frequency. The main frequency exhibits similar intrawave frequency
modulation as in other nonlinear systems: the further from this equilibrium point,
the stronger the nonlinearity. Although the amplitude variations can also cause some
intrawave frequency modulation as shown in ﬁgure 21, the magnitude of such eﬀects
should be small in comparison to the nonlinear eﬀects. In view of physical analogy
with the Duﬃng equation as in equation (9.4), and the discussions on all the previous cases, we believe the frequency–time distribution in the Hilbert spectrum is
more physical. The intrawave frequency modulations not only present a clear physical picture of the motion, but also eliminate the need for the spurious harmonics.
Again the low-frequency component needs a better interpretation.

looks symmetric. It can actually be decomposed into two components with diﬀerent frequency

regular intra- and interwave frequency modulations. The frequency variations bear one-to-one

(iii) R¨ossler equation
The R¨ossler equation is given by the system,
˙x = −(y + z),
˙y = x + 1
5 + z(x −μ),
in which μ is a constant parameter. We will just study the regular case with μ = 3.5,
which represents the famous period-doubling event. Figure 43 presents the phase diagram; ﬁgure 44, the time series of the components. The wave form of the x-component
is regular with an exact period of twice the high-frequency oscillation. The Fourier spectrum of x gives many harmonics, the characteristics of the R¨ossler system.
Applying the EMD method to the data, we have only three IMF components as

Figure 47. The Morlet wavelet spectrum shows only harmonics and some indication of
interwave frequency modulation. There are no details for the intrawave frequency modulations.
shown in ﬁgure 45: a seemingly uniform high-frequency component; an intermediate
frequency component; and a low-intensity low-frequency component with non-zero
mean. As this system contains exactly two time scales, this extra low-frequency component must be generated by numerical error. With the energy level only 10−6 times
that of the fundamental oscillation, its existence here has no dynamic consequence.
The remaining two periods are exactly once and twice that of the fundamental one.
The corresponding Hilbert spectrum, shown in ﬁgure 46, contains only two prominent components: the high-frequency component ﬂuctuating widely between 0.15 and
0.26 Hz, and the steady low-frequency band at 0.1 Hz. As shown in ﬁgure 46, the ﬂuctuating high-frequency component is strictly periodic with two basic wave periods
as the period doubling requires. Still, within the two wave periods, the frequency
undergoes intrawave frequency modulation that corresponds to the alternative long
and more rounded waves interlaced with the short and much sharper ones. With this
as a guide, one can see this frequency change clearly from the ﬁrst IMF component.
Here, we have both intrawave and interwave frequency modulations. To represent
such a case with either Fourier spectrum or wavelet analysis, one would need many
harmonics as shown in ﬁgure 47. Notice again here the diﬀerence of the scales on the
frequency axis in ﬁgures 46 and 47. All the interesting details pertinent to the frequency doubling can be seen clearly in the Hilbert spectrum, while the wavelet only
gives a profuse display of harmonics with little physically signiﬁcant detail. Thus, for
the ﬁrst time, the details of frequency variations have been determined quantitatively. No other methods can match the resolution power displayed here. The example
also illustrates the advantage of not requiring the IMF components to be orthogonal: here the two components in the frequency-doubling event share many of their
harmonics if expanded in the linear Fourier modes; then, the components are not
Figure 48. Comparison between the marginal spectrum and the Fourier spectrum for the R¨ossler
equation: (a) the marginal spectrum showing the low-frequency oscillation near 0.1 Hz, and

modulation; (b) the Fourier spectrum contains only harmonics with no indication of the two

time scales.
orthogonal. Yet, each component is physically distinct from the other with diﬀerent
characteristic time scales. Since EMD is based on the time scale and not on the insistence of orthogonality, it has overcome the shortcomings of the orthogonal Fourier
expansion, and successfully decomposed the data into two nonlinear components.
Another interesting comparison of the frequency contents from diﬀerent representations is in the marginal spectrum and the Fourier spectrum given in ﬁgures 48a, b,
respectively. The marginal spectrum gives a low-frequency peak and a broad bimodal
distribution near the main peak frequency, suggesting a typical distribution of a periodic variable. None of the peaks in the marginal spectrum agree with the main peak
in the Fourier spectrum, at 0.18 Hz and its harmonics. The 0.18 Hz oscillation given
by the Fourier spectrum is neither the observed nor the physical frequency; it is the
weighted mean of the broad band of interlaced long and short waves. This example
illustrates that even the main Fourier peak could be non-physical, an unexpected
but shocking revelation.
(b ) Observational data from laboratory and ﬁeld experiments
The main applications of the present method are to the time series analysis. In
this part, we will present a variety of data to illustrate the usefulness of the combined
EMD and Hilbert spectrum applied to controlled and natural phenomena.
Figure 49. The surface elevation data from a mechanically generated regular sinusoidal wave
train with initial frequency 2.5 Hz. The horizontal axis is time, the vertical axis is the distance
from the wave maker in metres. As the data show, the initial regular wave soon becomes highly
modulated as the wave moves down the tank.
(i) Laboratory wave data
Laboratory data from mechanically generated waves were used by Huang et al.
 to study the nonlinear evolution processes. Under the action of weak nonlinear
interactions, the frequency of the waves will downshift as they propagate, a process
necessary for the waves to become longer and grow higher under the wind. In the
narrow band wave ﬁeld, the downshift has been shown as the consequence of the wellknown Benjamin–Fier instability . The process is assumed
to be gradual and continuous. With the resolution power of the present method, we
want to show that the wave evolution process is not continuous and gradual but local
and discrete; that the well-known frequency downshift is an accumulation of discrete
fusion of n to (n−1) waves, also known as ‘crest pairing’ , and ‘lost crest’ . We will present some results
reported by Huang et al. to illustrate the application of the Hilbert spectral

 . Surface elevations were recorded at eight
stations along the tank for a mechanically generated sinusoidal wave. Huang et al.
 used the Hilbert transform and examined the change of the phase of the wave
trains. The waves are mechanically generated by a wave maker driven at 2.5 Hz with
the raw data of the test for all eight stations given in ﬁgure 49. After performing the
Figure 50. The phase function of the wave records from all eight stations. (a) The unwrapped
phase function showing the phase function seems to have evolved gradually down the tank. The
highest values are for the ﬁrst four stations; the ﬁrst time the phase deviates from the value of
the ﬁrst four stations is at station 5. (b) The phase function change relative to the values at
station 1. All the changes are shown to be concentrated at a certain narrow region, while the
phase function values remain unchanged at all other points. The amount of the changes stay at
a discrete value, 2π.
Hilbert transform on the data, the unwrapped phase functions for all eight stations
are shown in ﬁgure 50a, which indeed suggests the gradual change of the phase
function. The decrease in the slope of the phase function indicates the decrease of the
mean frequency. The slopes of the ﬁrst four stations, however, stay almost identical
to that of the ﬁrst station. The ﬁrst phase function that shows any deviation from
this initially closely clustered group is at station 5. To this scale, the frequency
change seems small and gradual. To examine the variation in more detail, we take
the diﬀerence of the phase functions of all stations with respect to the ﬁrst station,
which is our initial condition. The diﬀerence is shown in ﬁgure 50b, from which we
can see that the changes of the phase functions are the results of a series of steps
with the sharp jumps conﬁned in very short time spans.
To quantify these phase variations, we plot the phase change with respect to that
of the ﬁrst station in phase–amplitude diagrams in ﬁgure 51 for stations 2, 4, 5
and 6. The phase–amplitude diagram for station 5 shows that the phase starts to
jump, which reﬂects the sudden shift of the phase function shown in ﬁgure 50b. These
phase changes are very similar to the phase dislocations. As the number of jumps
increases, the phase function seems to become a continuous and almost smoothly
sloped line. But even for those cases, the amount of phase change involved in each
jump, as revealed by the amplitude–phase diagram, is still constant for all the phase
jumps: 2π. The 2π jump means a loss of exactly one wave in the process.
Figure 51. The phase-amplitude diagrams for stations 2, 4, 5 and 6. (a) Station 2, either the
amplitude or the phase have large variations in their values. (b) Station 4, the amplitude variation becomes large, yet the phase stays constant. (c) Station 5, both amplitude and phase
undergo large changes. The phase, however, stays only at discrete values, the multiples of 2π.
(d) Station 6, the phase values continue to expand, but always stay at the discrete jumps.
Let us now examine the wave elevation data in detail at the jump points. The time
series data are expanded and displayed in ﬁgure 52 in a two-way comparison. When
we superimpose the data from station 5 with its phase diﬀerence from station 1, we
ﬁnd the jump in the phase is easily associated with a single wave within one wave
period. Then we superimpose the raw elevation data from station 5 on those from
station 1 also shown in ﬁgure 52. One can immediately see that all the wave peaks
line up except at the location of the jump, where two waves become one; there is
a loss of one wave in each phase jump event. All the changes are local, abrupt and
The Hilbert spectrum is shown in ﬁgure 53, in which one can identify very local
events of abrupt change of frequency at the 25 and 48 s locations. The Hilbert spectrum reveals the typical intrawave frequency modulations of the Stokian water waves
and the more striking local shifts of frequency to a lower value at the locations coinciding with the phase jumps shown in ﬁgure 50b. Another interesting phenomenon
shows up in the marginal spectrum given in ﬁgure 54a, where there is a much wider
frequency distribution than expected caused by the intrawave frequency modulations. Furthermore, there is also a slight tendency for energy being shifted to the
subharmonics frequency. Whether this energy ﬂux is related to the subharmonic
instability studied by Longuet-Higgins deserves further investigation. The
Fourier spectrum, given in ﬁgure 54b, shows only sidebands and harmonics without

Surface elevation data at station 5 is given in the solid line; the data at station 1, in the dotted

analysis from the same data, shown in ﬁgure 55, fails to resolve any of the local
Using the Hilbert transform, we can examine the evolution of the weakly nonlinear
wave trains in detail. Although the processes have always been assumed to be globally stationary, the Hilbert transform reveals that the processes are actually abrupt
and local. Such variations are locally inhomogeneous; thus, they cannot be analysed
adequately by Fourier analysis. Furthermore, the local variations are abrupt and
discrete, having the typical characteristics of particles. The frequency downshift is a
cumulative eﬀect of fusions of two waves into one, or three waves into two, etc. The
fusion processes are irreversible. This asymmetry is due to the preferred direction
of downward energy ﬂow. Our results also raise concerns over the past assumptions
on gradual and continuous variations of the wave number and frequency of a wave
train. With the discrete jumps and the particle-like nature of the individual wave,
there may be a need for a new paradigm to represent the abrupt and discrete changes
analytically. It will be a new challenge for nonlinear wave study.
Before leaving this section, let us also examine the data from station 1 to illustrate
the eﬀects of the nonlinear distortion of the water-wave surface. Because the emphasis
is on the nonlinear distortion, we have ﬁrst smoothed the data by a weighted running
average so that the small irregularity will not cause mode mixing. A selected section
Figure 53. The Hilbert spectrum for the wave data at station 5. Other than the two locations
of phase jumps, the frequency of the wave train stays at a very narrow range of intrawave
modulation, and could be considered as having gradual and continuous frequency changes. But
at the phase jump locations, the frequency of the wave train undergoes so much change as to
make the assumption of a gradual and continuous function invalid.

of the data (5 s in length) and their Hilbert and wavelet spectra are given in ﬁgures 56
and 57, respectively. In ﬁgure 56, one can see the intrawave frequency modulation as
shown in the model equation (8.5). The frequency ﬂuctuates within a very narrow
range around 2.5 Hz, the frequency of the wave maker. In general, the high local
frequency values line up with the peaks, and the low local frequency values line up
with the troughs as expected of the Stokes waves. In fact, it has been shown by Huang
et al. that the gravity water wave can be approximated well by the Stokes
model. On more detailed examination, however, the alignment is not perfect: there is
a slight but systematic shift of the phase toward the wave front, an indication of the
front–back asymmetry of the wave-proﬁle. In wavelet results shown in ﬁgure 57, one
can no longer see any intrawave frequency modulation. Instead, there are harmonics
again that line up with the wave front, those alignments conﬁrm the Hilbert spectrum
result: the waves have front and back asymmetry. In the wavelet spectrum, the energy
containing frequency range is much wider than that in the Hilbert spectrum, an
indication of energy leakage of the wavelet analysis. This comparison illustrates that
the nonlinear wave distortion can indeed be explained by the much more physical
interpretation as the intrawave frequency modulation.
Before ending this section, a few words on the Fourier representation of the wave
ﬁeld are necessary. Because the Fourier expansion of the wave ﬁeld is so natural, it
has been deeply associated with wave studies, so much so that thinking in terms of
frequency (Hz)
Figure 56. The Hilbert spectrum for a selected 5 s at station 1 with the surface elevation data
plotted on an arbitrary scale. The Hilbert spectrum shows the intrawave frequency modulation
of the water waves, an indication of the nonlinear surface distortion similar to the Stokes wave.
But detailed comparison shows that there is a phase shift in the real data: the front of the wave
is distorted more than the back even without wind, a physical process failed to be modelled by
the Stokes wave.
Fourier components becomes a matter of fact. But these harmonics are not physical,
they are not the solutions to any nonlinear equations. Furthermore, it is well known
that a monochromatic wave is unstable; one cannot assume a collection of such
components to exist for all the time everywhere to synthesize the whole wave ﬁeld
to explain the physical phenomena. A new paradigm is needed.
(ii) Field wave data
The ﬁeld data of waves were collected by the NOAA New Tidal Gauge, located
at Duck North Carolina, at the high data rate of 1 Hz. Figure 58 shows the raw
data for 60 min. This is typical ocean wave data from the ﬁeld stations: random and
almost ‘statistically stationary’. In the past, these types of data were treated with
Fourier analysis. In fact, the studies of the wave spectra from Fourier analysis have
been a main subject of the wave research .
These data, when subject to the EMD method, yield eight components as shown
in ﬁgure 59, with the last component indicating the tidal variation. The Hilbert
spectrum is given in ﬁgure 60 and the corresponding wavelet spectrum in ﬁgure 61.
While both spectra show a energy concentration around 0.1 Hz, the wavelet spectrum
gives a much more continuous distribution in time, and much wider spread of energy
consisting primarily of the harmonics in the frequency axis.
frequency (Hz)
Figure 57. The Morlet wavelet spectrum of the same selected section as in ﬁgure 56. The wavelet
spectrum fails to show the intrawave frequency modulation, but the leakage smears the energy
over a much wider frequency range. The location of the harmonics, however, show the same
phase shift towards the wave front as in the Hilbert spectrum.
To examine the results in detail, a short section of the data covering only 5 min
is plotted in three ways. First, the Hilbert and the wavelet spectra are plotted separately with the corresponding surface elevation of the wave data in ﬁgures 62 and 63,
respectively. In this expanded form, the Hilbert spectrum is very diﬀerent from the
wavelet spectrum. Then, the two diﬀerent spectra are also plotted together with the
Hilbert spectrum in contour lines superimposed on the wavelet spectrum in ﬁgure 64.
In these presentations, they both show similar locations of energy concentration in
time and frequency axes, but the Hilbert spectrum gives a sharper and more reﬁned
deﬁnition of the energy contour in ﬁgures 62 and 64. Take the data and the spectra
near 57 min location for example: the data show a packet of high-amplitude lowfrequency waves with frequency increasing and amplitude decreasing both before
and after the packet. Both of these trends are vividly portrayed by the Hilbert spectrum, but they are only vaguely suggested in the wavelet spectrum. These variations
suggested that the ocean waves are non-stationary, a conclusion supported by Huang
et al. .
Finally, let us also compare the marginal spectra from both the Hilbert and wavelet
spectra with that of the Fourier spectrum in ﬁgure 65, in which the values of the
spectra are staggered for clarity: the top line is the wavelet result; the middle one
is the Hilbert spectrum; and the bottom is the Fourier spectrum. The contrast is
similar to the cases discussed in the calibration and validation section: due to the
Time (min)

the tides, the mean is not zero.
leakage, the wavelet spectrum is totally devoid of detail. While the Hilbert and direct
Fourier spectra both show rich frequency contents, the lack of high harmonics due
to either the nonlinear or the non-stationary eﬀects in the Hilbert spectrum suggest
that it can portray the energy–frequency presentation more precisely.
(iii) Tide and tsunami data
The ﬁeld wave data selected here were also collected by the NOAA New Tidal
Gauge. This gauge, located inside Kahului Harbour, Maui, is capable of recording
data at 1 min steps. Figure 66 shows the raw data from the tidal gauge for ﬁve
days from October 4–9, 1994. On October 5, tsunami-induced waves arrived at the
site and created water level changes of a magnitude comparable to that of the tidal
signal. Although the tidal data are traditionally analysed with Fourier expansion the
added tsunami waves are transient. The combination, therefore, makes the whole
time series non-stationary. Filtering cannot remove the tsunami signal cleanly, for
the transient data and the tide will have many harmonic components in the same
frequency range.
The EMD method yields eight IMF components from the data as shown in ﬁgure 67. Because the time scales of the tide and the tsunami waves are so diﬀerent,
the eight IMF components can be easily divided into two groups: the high-frequency
signal representing the tsunami-induced waves; and the last three low-frequency components representing the tide. After the IMFs were used to reconstitute the two

separate wave motions, the raw data, the tidal component and the tsunami-induced
waves are plotted together in ﬁgure 68. Here, the EMD serves as a ﬁlter to separate
the tide and the transient tsunami without any ambiguity.
Figure 69 gives the Hilbert spectrum from which the arrival time and the frequency
change of the tsunami waves are clearly shown in this energy–frequency–time distribution. Besides the clear dispersion properties of the tsunami waves, there are two
more interesting new observations: ﬁrst, the variations of the tsunami wave frequency are phase locked with the tidal cycle; second, the tsunami waves in the harbour
lasted many tidal cycles, with a frequency of half a cycle per hour. Such a period
would not ﬁt into the limited space inside the harbour of Kahului. The more likely
explanation is for the tsunami waves being trapped in the bay, which has a much
larger area for the wave to propagate. Details of the oscillation will be discussed in
a separate paper.
In the above presentation, the tidal components are not emphasized. As a demonstration of the versatility of the Hilbert spectral analysis, the tidal components can
be selected to construct the Hilbert spectrum. The result is given in ﬁgure 70, in
which both the diurnal and semi-diurnal tides are clearly shown. In the marginal
spectrum of the tidal components in ﬁgure 71, however, the frequency for the semidiurnal tide is much more variable, especially at the time when the tsunami had
just arrived, and towards the end of the measurement period. This variability seen
in the marginal spectrum raises an interesting problem: whether there is interaction

between the tide and the tsunami. Compared to the traditional Fourier spectrum,
the marginal spectrum again shows the absence of the harmonics. The reason seems
to be clear: the tidal waves measured at a coastal station should be nonlinear because
the shallow water propagation is governed by a nonlinear equation. The absence of
the harmonics raises a question concerning the best way to present the tidal data.
Should one use harmonic analysis? Or should one accept the intrawave frequency
modulation to represent the nonlinearity? This is another interesting question for
further study. Based on the discussion so far, it seems that the intrawave frequency
modulation representation would be more physical.
(iv) Altimeter data from the equatorial ocean
Satellite altimetry has been a powerful technique for large scale ocean circulation
studies . Because of the importance of
the equatorial region in determining the global climate pattern, the altimeter data
have been used extensively to study the dynamics of this area . The accepted view of the equatorial
dynamics is the propagation of Kelvin waves forced by variable wind stress . In this model, the wave propagation will leave a surface
elevation signature of the order of 10 cm, which can be measured by the satellite
altimeter. Such continuous available data now are derived from both crossover and
collinear diﬀerences , covering the period from April 1985

latitude. A typical time series on the equatorial sea surface elevation data at 174◦E
is given in ﬁgure 72.
Limited by the data length and complicated by the dynamics, all the past investigators have problems in processing this obviously non-stationary data. We have
analysed the data using two methods: the wavelet analysis and the Hilbert spectral
analysis. Although the wavelet results, given in ﬁgure 73 show the ﬂuctuation of
energy as a function of time and frequency, the energy distribution as a function of
time and frequency is too diﬀused to yield any quantitative information.
The EMD method on the same sets of data yields four IMF components and a
residual trend as shown in ﬁgure 74. The corresponding Hilbert spectrum is given
in ﬁgure 75. The sharpness of the frequency–time resolution in the Hilbert spectrum
is obvious. The most important properties of the wave are the strong intrawave
frequency modulations. Each wave group will have a frequency change over 1.2–
9.6 cycles per year within a period of 50–200 days. When we started the investigation
of data using Hilbert spectral analysis, this was the ﬁrst time we encountered the
strong intrawave frequency modulation. The curious frequency variations led us to
the re-examination of the classical nonlinear systems, which eventually clariﬁed the
role of intrawave frequency modulations. In the present example, one can argue that,
with the ocean depth as a small fraction of the horizontal extent, the low-frequency
geophysical wave motions are in shallow water, then the wave motions must be

On October 5, tsunami waves reached the tidal station with a signal of comparable strength to
that of the tides. Though the tides can be regular, the tsunami waves are transient.

governed by nonlinear equations. Although frequency modulation phenomena are
known to exist in wavelet analysis, the strength and the clearness of the modulations
as shown here are seldom seen in other natural phenomena by other time–frequency
distribution methods.
The dynamics of the equatorial Kelvin waves have been discussed extensively
by Zheng et al. . They concluded that steady wind cannot excite sustained
Kelvin waves, but the variable wind, especially the westerly wind burst, can cause
resonant interactions of the excited Kelvin waves with an intrinsic frequency of (1.0±
0.2) × 10−2 cycles per day, or 0.22–0.34 cycles per year. A prevailing band of energy
can be easily seen in ﬁgure 75. At around 400 days after the starting date of the
data, a combination of strong low-frequency (less than 0.5 cycles per year) and highfrequency (4–5 cycles per year) events occurred, which coincided with the onset of the
1986–1987 El Ni˜no. Although the Hilbert spectrum shows some energy distribution
anomaly, we need more data to deduce the characteristics of such special events
as El Ni˜no. Further discussion will be given separately. Time series data at diﬀerent
locations can be synthesized to produce a four-dimensional Hilbert spectrum to show
the energy–frequency–time–space evolution. The details of this will be discussed later
in a separate paper.

is the length of time they lasted. Both the diurnal and the semi-diurnal tidal cycles are also
(v) Earthquake data
All the earthquakes are transient ; the data are, therefore, nonstationary. For lack of alternatives, in seismology as well as earthquake engineering,
most data are still processed with the Fourier analysis . The diﬃculties with the Fourier spectral analysis are associated
with the nonlinear and the non-stationary nature of the data. Such methods cannot
reveal the detailed information in the dispersion properties, the wave form deformation, and the energy–frequency distribution. All these properties are needed for
understanding of the crest structure geophysics in general, and deducing the site
speciﬁc ground motions in particular.
Most of the near ﬁeld strong earthquake ground motions are of extremely short
duration, lasting only a few ten to a few seconds at most. Such records always give
artiﬁcially wide Fourier spectra because of the non-stationarity. The wide frequency
distribution will dilute the energy content everywhere on the frequency axis and
mask the true energy–frequency distribution, and result in under estimation of the
energy density at the critical resonant frequency for speciﬁc structures.
Although the earthquake wave motion has always been treated as a linear process,
the strong ground motion may not be linear as revealed by the distorted wave forms

in the data . The rich higher harmonics, a typical
consequence of Fourier analysis when applied to nonlinearly deformed signals, have
also contributed to clouding the characteristics of the real signal.
Finally, to apply the Fourier analysis, some kind of window must be used to eliminate the end eﬀects and to facilitate computation. For a truly non-stationary process,
there is no time scale to guide the choice of the window size. A long time window
(10 s, say) is necessary for resolving low frequency (0.1 Hz) which are critical for
modern high-rise structures, but too long a window will be plagued by the nonstationarity. Such a diﬃculty has never been fully resolved when Fourier spectral
analysis is applied to earthquake data.
As explained above, both non-stationarity and nonlinearity can induce artiﬁcial
frequency smearing and reduce the true energy density. We will use a few sets of
data to illustrate EMD and the Hilbert spectral analysis technique with the following emphases: to illustrate the gross misrepresentation of the energy–frequency
distribution by the Fourier spectrum. We will use the well-tested data from the El
Centro earthquake to illustrate our point here.
The original data are shown in ﬁgure 76. These data, when decomposed by EMD,
give ten components as shown in ﬁgure 77, with the corresponding Hilbert spectrum
given in ﬁgure 78. From the Hilbert spectrum, we can see the diﬀused energy in
the high-frequency range, while the persistent energy resides along horizontal belts
below 1 Hz. To assure the Hilbert spectrum is a valid representation of the energy–

frequency–time distribution we also used the standard Morlet wavelet analysis on the
same data. The result is given in ﬁgure 79. Direct comparison between the Hilbert
spectrum and the wavelet analysis is not easy, for the Hilbert spectrum gives too
many details. A 15 × 15-point smoothing gives the smoothed spectrum in ﬁgure 80.
Now the similarity is reassuring: they show a similar pattern of energy concentration in the low-frequency range. But the diﬀerence really calls for alternatives: being
Fourier based, the wavelet result gives much more pronounced high-frequency components than does the Hilbert spectrum, a built-in deﬁciency in the Fourier analysis
discussed in the last section.
Other than the Hilbert spectrum, the marginal spectrum and the corresponding
Fourier spectrum are presented in ﬁgures 81a–d. Although our results are presented
with linear scales and in terms of frequency rather than period, the energy–frequency
distribution with further smoothing is consistent with the previous analysis of the
data shown in Newmark & Rosenblueth . The Fourier spectrum has a much
wider energy distribution; consequently, the energy content for any frequency is also
much lower than the corresponding values in the Hilbert spectrum. Furthermore,
the two spectra have drastically diﬀerent energy distribution patterns caused by the
tendency for energy smearing of the Fourier spectrum. While both spectra give a
decreasing trend in energy density as a function of frequency, the Fourier spectrum
shows a conspicuous lack of energy in the low-frequency range (less than 1 Hz), as

shown in the detailed spectra covering only the 0–5 Hz frequency range. The lowfrequency range critical to the high-rise structures is severely under represented.
This peakiness of energy located at a very narrow frequency range can cause resonance oscillation of buildings, and has been observed to have caused great destruction
at Mexico City during the 1985 earthquake. Hadley et al. studied such a case
and attributed the peakiness to soil-induced ampliﬁcation of the ground motion. He
further concluded that the oscillation could not be duplicated by any linear model.
The new Hilbert spectral analysis has clearly identiﬁed the new oscillation mode
similar to the case studied by Hadley et al. but from a diﬀerent cause. Such
oscillation modes would have been totally obscured by Fourier spectral analysis.
From the Fourier spectra, there are no clear-cut corner frequency or frequencies for
one to construct the envelope spectrum . There are also no
discernible stationary segments as postulated by the time history envelope method.
We also have to notice that even the criteria used to establish such segments based
on the earthquake energy are still under debate currently .
In summary, there is no alternative to the Hilbert spectral analysis in earthquake or
seismology studies.
(vi) The laboratory wind data
Finally, let us return to the laboratory wind data used at the beginning to illustrate the sifting and Hilbert spectral analysis procedures. In the smoothed form,

distributions are similar to the Hilbert spectrum but the distribution is much diﬀused, and there

the Hilbert spectrum looks similar to the wavelet analysis result, yet they are still
diﬀerent. Two prominent diﬀerences stand out: the ﬁrst is the absence of the higher
harmonics in the Hilbert spectrum compared with the wavelet result; the second is
the appearance of frequency modulated ridges of energy in the Hilbert spectrum.
Both characteristics of the Hilbert spectrum are new and signiﬁcant.
In the Hilbert spectrum, we can see the increase in energy density with time,
especially after 10 s following the initiation of the data. Most of the new energy
is in the 2–5 Hz range with strong continuous frequency modulation rather than
the richness of high-harmonic components in the wavelet analysis. As the frequency
modulation is the signature of nonlinear mechanisms, the Hilbert spectrum clearly
shows the nonlinear properties of the turbulent ﬂows.
From the IMF components, we can see that c2 through c6 are of the same magnitude. Collectively, they represent the bulk of the turbulent energy. All these components are highly intermittent, as indicated by the stationarity index study. Even
after averaging, the DSS still indicates strong peaks at 7 and 17 Hz, which correspond to the ﬁrst two peaks of the marginal spectrum in ﬁgure 11. These frequency
ranges are represented by the components c2 through c6. In order to study the energy in this frequency range in detail, a special Hilbert spectrum for the components
c2 through c6 is constructed as in ﬁgure 82. We cannot detect any change in the
overall energy level, but we can certainly see the intermittency. According to Liu &

and time localization than the wavelet spectrum given in ﬁgure 79.
Liu , nonlinearity and intermittency are the common properties of the turbulent ﬂows. Let us examine the instantaneous energy density as shown in ﬁgure 83.
As expected, the ﬂuctuating components of the wind contain relatively low energy
compared with the mean wind, or the trend, as shown by the dotted line. If the
energy of the trend is added to the ﬂuctuation, the overall energy is quite levelled,
but the density is too high to be shown with the ﬂuctuating components. In ﬁgure 83, the overall energy density has been divided by 100 in order to plot the two
curves together for comparison. Because the total energy is dominated by the mean
wind, we have recommended its omission in construction of the Hilbert spectrum. It
can easily overwhelm all the other components; therefore, it should not be included
unless specially justiﬁed. Construction of the special Hilbert spectrum with selected
IMF components is an equivalent of bandpass ﬁltering through EMD, yet it is diﬀerent from the Fourier bandpass ﬁltering, for we are not restricted by the stationarity
requirement as in the Fourier analysis.
10. Discussion
In this paper, we have presented the empirical mode decomposition method and
the associated Hilbert spectral analysis. The combination has proven to be versatile
and robust in analysis of nonlinear and non-stationary data. Although the new idea

Because of this narrow distribution in the frequency space, the energy density is at least a factor
of three higher than the Fourier spectrum. (d) Marginal spectrum for the detailed 5 Hz range.

The high density and low frequency should cause major concerns for earthquake engineering,

of an adaptive basis makes the method highly eﬀective and physically sound, there
are, however, areas needing future attention.
First the spline ﬁtting needs improvements. As the description of the sifting process
indicates, the spline ﬁtting is the essential step in generating the intrinsic mode
function, the basis for the Hilbert spectral analysis. Although the present envelopemean method works well in most cases, problems still exist. The cubic spline ﬁtting
adopted here has both overshoot and undershoot problems. These problems can
be alleviated by using more sophisticated spline methods, such as the taut spline
in which the tension of the spline curve can be adjusted. But our trials of taut
spline showed only marginal improvement. The alternative is the higher-order spline
programs which would be more time consuming. Exploration of the higher-order
spline is underway. Even with this problem, we believe that we have detected most of
the dynamic characteristics of the data examined. Any improvements would probably
be marginal.
As the spline procedure is time consuming, more eﬃcient methods can be devised

turbulent ﬂow is dominated by the intermittence and frequency modulations, a sure sign that
nonlinear mechanisms are at work.
by using simple means of successive extrema instead from the envelope mean. In this
way, only one spline ﬁtting is required rather than two. It is easier to implement, but
the shortcomings are the more severe amplitude averaging eﬀects when the neighbouring extrema are of diﬀerent magnitudes. The successive-mean method will have
a stronger forcing to reach uniform amplitudes, in which the true physics associated
with amplitude will be destroyed. Only for problems where the amplitudes of the
components are nearly constant should this method be used.
Either the envelope-mean or the successive-mean method when applied with the
requirement of absolute symmetry will produce the absurd result of uniform amplitude IMFs. Therefore, the criteria in the sifting process should be chosen judiciously.
One should avoid the too stringent criterion that we would get uniform amplitude
IMFs; on the other hand, one should also avoid too loose a criterion that would
produce components deviating too much from IMFs. The results as reported in the
sifting section were arrived at by our somewhat limited experience. With this new
approach, further studies and quantitative criteria perhaps are worthwhile to explore.
Second, the end eﬀects need more improvements, too. There are two types of end
eﬀects: in the spline ﬁtting; and in the Hilbert transform. It is well known that the
most serious problem of the spline ﬁtting is at the ends, where cubic splines can have
wide swings if left unattended. We have adopted a method of adding characteristic
waves at the ends which are deﬁned by the two consecutive extrema for both their
Figure 83. The instantaneous energy density of the ﬂuctuating components only (dotted line)
and the overall energy density with the trend included (solid line). The component representing
the trend can easily overwhelm the ﬂuctuating components; therefore, it should not be included
unless specially justiﬁed.
frequency and amplitude of the added waves. This method has conﬁned the large
swings successfully. Further studies are needed to guarantee that the ends would not
corrupt the data and propagate to the interior.
Other than the spline ﬁtting, the Hilbert transform also has end eﬀects, for the
numerical method to implement the Hilbert transformation is based on the Fourier
transform. Since the ﬁrst and the last points of the data are usually of diﬀerent
values, the Fourier transform will induce additional components to bridge over the
diﬀerence resulting in the well-known Gibbs phenomena. To eliminate it in the Fourier transform, various windows have been adopted .
In our applications, instead of a window which will eliminate some useful data at
the end, we have again added two characteristic waves at either end. These attached
waves begin at the slightly enlarged data set with zero, and likewise end it with a
zero level. Thus, the annoying Gibbs phenomena are greatly reduced.
Third, we have to be careful in the case of weak signals imbedded in stronger ones.
Both the envelope-mean and successive-mean methods depend on the existence of
extrema. In fact, our method is built on the identiﬁcation of scale from successive
extrema. If weak signals are imbedded in other strong ones, the extrema might not
even be visible to the eyes; however, the sifting process can still pick them up. If the
weak signals are phase locked with, and occur only at, the maximum slope regions
of the strong signals, then we would have diﬃculty picking them up. In this case, the
weak signals appear as intrawave frequency modulations. If it is necessary to separate
them, the data can be diﬀerentiated once before processing. Since diﬀerentiation is
a linear operation, it will neither create nor annihilate scales. Therefore, such an
operation could be used if needed. It is also observed that, for strictly linear and
stationary data, Fourier spectral analysis can produce superior results.
Fourth, the Hilbert transform needs over-sampled data to deﬁne the instantaneous
frequency precisely. In Fourier analysis, the Nyquist frequency is deﬁned by two
points per wave. But the frequency is deﬁned for a wave covering the whole data
span. In our analysis, the instantaneous frequency is deﬁned through a diﬀerentiation
process, and thus more data points will help to deﬁne the frequency more accurately.
Based on our experience, a minimum number of data points to deﬁne a frequency
is ﬁve (or 4∆t). The lack of ﬁne time steps can be alleviated by interpolating more
points between the available data. As a spline interpretation would neither create
nor annihilate scales, it also can be used for the interpolation when the data are
very jagged from being under-sampled. The smoothed data, though, have a longer
length and are sometimes easier to process. The interpretation serves to give better
frequency deﬁnition.
Fifth, we should reiterate the strength of the EMD method. EMD is built on the
idea of identifying the various scales in the data, the quantities of great physical
signiﬁcance; therefore, in the sifting procedure, orthogonality is not a consideration,
but scales are. Since orthogonal decomposition is a characteristic for linear systems,
violating this restriction is not a shortcoming but a breakthrough. Therefore, the
decomposed IMFs may or may not be orthogonal. As such, this method can be
applied to nonlinear data. Though the IMFs in most cases are practically orthogonal,
it is a coincidence rather than a requirement of the EMD. The dependence on the
existence of scale for mode deﬁnition has one limitation: the decomposition method
cannot separate signals when their frequencies are too close. In this case, there would
not be any characteristic scale; therefore, physically they are identical. This may be
the most severe limitation of this method, if we count it as one. Details of the
restrictions will be studied later. Another advantage of the method is the eﬀective
use of all the data. In the sifting process, the longest scale is deﬁned by the full
length of the data. As a result, EMD can deﬁne many long period oscillations. As is
well known, the Hilbert transform tends to identify the highest frequency , the extraction of the long-period components is indeed an unexpected bonus
of the EMD.
Finally, though the EMD method will give IMF components, the individual component does not guarantee a well-deﬁned physical meaning. This is true for all decompositions, especially for the methods with a priori basis. In most cases, however,
the IMFs do carry physical signiﬁcance. Great caution should be exercised in making such attempts. The rule for interpreting the physical signiﬁcance of the IMFs is
that the scales should be clearly separated. Together with the Hilbert spectrum, the
totality of the presentation should give a much more detailed representation of the
physical processes.
11. Conclusions
The combination of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the
associated Hilbert spectral analysis has oﬀered a powerful method for nonlinear non-
stationary data analysis. Central to the present approach is the sifting process to
produce the IMFs, which enables complicated data to be reduced into such a form
that the instantaneous frequencies can be deﬁned. These IMFs forming the basis of
the decomposition are complete and practically orthogonal. The expansion in terms
of the IMF basis has the appearance of a generalized Fourier analysis with variable
amplitudes and frequencies. It is the ﬁrst local and adaptive method in frequency–
time analysis.
A great advantage of EMD and Hilbert spectral analysis is the eﬀective use of the
data. In EMD, we have used all the data in deﬁning the longest period component.
Furthermore, we do not need a whole wave to deﬁne the local frequency, for the
Hilbert transform gives the best ﬁt local sine or cosine form to the local data; therefore, the frequency resolution for any point is uniformly deﬁned by the stationary
phase method or local derivative of the phase. This advantage is especially eﬀective
in extracting the low-frequency oscillations. Unlike the wavelet analysis, the instantaneous frequency can still be localized in time even for the longest period component
without spreading energy over wide frequency and time ranges. Still, another advantage of EMD and Hilbert spectral analysis is its application to transient data without
zero or mean references; the trend or the DC term is automatically eliminated. The
introduction of the Hilbert spectrum also provided a quantitative measure of the
degree of stationarity. Various examples presented here testify to the usefulness of
this new method.
Other than the practical methodology, the most important conceptual innovations
of the present study are the physical signiﬁcance assigned to the instantaneous frequency for each mode of a complicated data set, and the introduction of the IMF.
By adopting the instantaneous frequency, we can clearly deﬁne both the inter- and
intrawave frequency modulations in a wave train. Such frequency modulations are
totally lost in Fourier spectral analysis, and only the interwave frequency modulation can be vaguely depicted in the wavelet analysis. Yet, both the interwave and
the intrawave frequency modulations are critical in interpretation of oscillatory phenomena: the former explains the wave form deformation by nonlinear eﬀects, which
traditionally has been taken as the harmonic distortion; the latter explains the dispersive propagation of waves. The intrawave frequency modulation oﬀers new insight
into nonlinear oscillation systems in more detail than the modern topological treatment. By adopting the instantaneous frequency, we have not only eliminated the
need for higher harmonics to simulate the nonlinearly deformed waves, but also the
spurious harmonics to simulate the non-stationary data. We believe this new method
can give us new physical insight in all other nonlinear and non-stationary phenomena. The instantaneous frequency can only be deﬁned for IMF, which is deﬁned here
based on the local properties of the data rather than the global restrictions proposed
We have only begun to explore the full physical interpretations of the Hilbert
spectra for complicated data. Associated properties of the marginal spectra and
various deﬁnitions of stationarity also need to be explored in the future.
