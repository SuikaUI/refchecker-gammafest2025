Teaching machines to accomplish tasks
by conversing naturally with humans is
challenging. Currently, developing taskoriented dialogue systems requires creating
multiple components and typically this involves either a large amount of handcrafting, or acquiring costly labelled datasets
to solve a statistical learning problem for
each component. In this work we introduce a neural network-based text-in, textout end-to-end trainable goal-oriented dialogue system along with a new way of
collecting dialogue data based on a novel
pipe-lined Wizard-of-Oz framework. This
approach allows us to develop dialogue systems easily and without making too many
assumptions about the task at hand. The
results show that the model can converse
with human subjects naturally whilst helping them to accomplish tasks in a restaurant
search domain.
Introduction
Building a task-oriented dialogue system such as
a hotel booking or a technical support service is
difﬁcult because it is application-speciﬁc and there
is usually limited availability of training data. To
mitigate this problem, recent machine learning approaches to task-oriented dialogue system design
have cast the problem as a partially observable
Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with the aim of using reinforcement learning (RL) to train dialogue policies online through
interactions with real users .
However, the language understanding and language generation modules still rely on supervised learning and therefore
need corpora to train on. Furthermore, to make
RL tractable, the state and action space must be
carefully designed , which may restrict the expressive power
and learnability of the model. Also, the reward
functions needed to train such models are difﬁcult
to design and hard to measure at run-time .
At the other end of the spectrum, sequence to
sequence learning has inspired several efforts to build end-to-end trainable,
non-task-oriented conversational systems . This family of approaches treats dialogue
as a source to target sequence transduction problem,
applying an encoder network to
encode a user query into a distributed vector representing its semantics, which then conditions a
decoder network to generate each system response.
These models typically require a large amount of
data to train. They allow the creation of effective
chatbot type systems but they lack any capability
for supporting domain speciﬁc tasks, for example,
being able to interact with databases and aggregate useful
information into their responses.
In this work, we propose a neural network-based
model for task-oriented dialogue systems by balancing the strengths and the weaknesses of the two
research communities: the model is end-to-end
trainable1 but still modularly connected; it does not
directly model the user goal, but nevertheless, it
still learns to accomplish the required task by providing relevant and appropriate responses at each
turn; it has an explicit representation of database
(DB) attributes (slot-value pairs) which it uses to
achieve a high task success rate, but has a distributed representation of user intent (dialogue act)
1We deﬁne end-to-end trainable as that each system module is trainable from data except for a database operator.

to allow ambiguous inputs; and it uses delexicalisation2 and a weight tying strategy to reduce the data required to train the model,
but still maintains a high degree of freedom should
larger amounts of data become available. We show
that the proposed model performs a given task very
competitively across several metrics when trained
on only a few hundred dialogues.
In order to train the model for the target application, we introduce a novel pipe-lined data collection mechanism inspired by the Wizard-of-Oz
paradigm to collect human-human
dialogue corpora via crowd-sourcing. We found
that this process is simple and enables fast data
collection online with very low development costs.
We treat dialogue as a sequence to sequence mapping problem ) augmented
with the dialogue history ) and the
current database search outcome (modelled by a
database operator), as shown in Figure 1. At each
turn, the system takes a sequence of tokens2 from
the user as input and converts it into two internal representations: a distributed representation
generated by an intent network and a probability
distribution over slot-value pairs called the belief
state generated by a set of belief trackers. The database operator then selects the

tokens (e.g. keywords like Chinese or Indian are replaced by
<v.food> in Figure 1) to allow weight sharing.
most probable values in the belief state to form a
query to the DB, and the search result, along with
the intent representation and belief state are transformed and combined by a policy network to form
a single vector representing the next system action.
This system action vector is then used to condition
a response generation network which generates the required
system output token by token in skeletal form. The
ﬁnal system response is then formed by substituting the actual values of the database entries into
the skeletal sentence structure. A more detailed
description of each component is given below.
Intent Network
The intent network can be viewed as the encoder in the sequence-to-sequence learning framework whose job is to encode a sequence of input tokens wt
a distributed vector representation zt at every turn
t. Typically, a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)
network is
used and the last time step hidden layer zN
t is taken
as the representation,
t = LSTM(wt
Alternatively, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) can be used in place of the LSTM as the
encoder ,
zt = CNN(wt
and here we investigate both. Since all the slotvalue speciﬁc information is delexicalised, the encoded vector can be viewed as a distributed intent

the CNN feature extractor is a concatenation of top-level sentence (green) embedding and several levels
of intermediate ngram-like embeddings (red and blue). However, if a value cannot be delexicalised in the
input, its ngram-like embeddings will all be padded with zeros. We pad zero vectors (in gray) before each
convolution operation to make sure the representation at each layer has the same length. The output of

representation which replaces the hand-coded dialogue act representation in traditional task-oriented dialogue systems.
Belief Trackers
Belief tracking (also called Dialogue State tracking) provides the core of a task-oriented spoken
dialogue system (SDS) . Current state-of-the-art belief trackers use discriminative models such as recurrent neural networks
(RNN) to
directly map ASR hypotheses to belief states . Although
in this work we focus on text-based dialogue systems, we retain belief tracking at the core of our
system because: (1) it enables a sequence of freeform natural language sentences to be mapped into
a ﬁxed set of slot-value pairs, which can then be
used to query a DB. This can be viewed as a simple
version of a semantic parser ;
(2) by keeping track of the dialogue state, it avoids
learning unnecessarily complicated long-term dependencies from raw inputs; (3) it uses a smart
weight tying strategy that can greatly reduce the
data required to train the model, and (4) it provides
an inherent robustness which simpliﬁes future extension to spoken systems.
Using each user input as new evidence, the task
of a belief tracker is to maintain a multinomial distribution p over values v ∈Vs for each informable
slot s, and a binary distribution for each requestable
slot3. Each slot in the ontology G4 has its own
specialised tracker, and each tracker is a Jordantype (recurrence from output to hidden layer) RNN5 with a CNN feature extractor, as
shown in Figure 2. Like Mrkši´c et al. , we
tie the RNN weights together for each value v but
vary features ft
v when updating each pre-softmax
activation gt
v. The update equations for a given slot

and scalar g∅,s are parameters. pt

that the user has not mentioned that slot up to turn t
and can be calculated by substituting g∅,s for gt

discourse context at each turn, the feature vector
3Informable slots are slots that users can use to constrain
the search, such as food type or price range; Requestable slots
are slots that users can ask a value for, such as address.

system can talk about for a particular task.

slots since they don’t need to be tracked.
v,cnn is the concatenation of two CNN derived
features, one from processing the user input ut at
turn t and the other from processing the machine
response mt−1 at turn t −1,
v,cnn = CNN(u)
s,v(ut) ⊕CNN(m)
s,v (mt−1)
where every token in ut and mt−1 is represented by
an embedding of size N derived from a 1-hot input
vector. In order to make the tracker aware when
delexicalisation is applied to a slot or value, the
slot-value specialised CNN operator CNN(·)
s,v(·) extracts not only the top level sentence representation
but also intermediate n-gram-like embeddings determined by the position of the delexicalised token
in each utterance. If multiple matches are observed,
the corresponding embeddings are summed. On the
other hand, if there is no match for a particular slot
or value, the empty n-gram embeddings are padded
with zeros. In order to keep track of the position of
delexicalised tokens, both sides of the sentence are
padded with zeros before each convolution operation. The number of vectors is determined by the
ﬁlter size at each layer. The overall process of extracting several layers of position-speciﬁc features
is visualised in Figure 2.
The belief tracker described above is based
on Henderson et al. with some modiﬁcations: (1) only probabilities over informable and
requestable slots and values are output, (2) the recurrent memory block is removed, since it appears
to offer no beneﬁt in this task, and (3) the n-gram
feature extractor is replaced by the CNN extractor described above. By introducing slot-based
belief trackers, we essentially add a set of intermediate labels into the system as compared to training a pure end-to-end system. Later in the paper
we will show that these tracker components are
critical for achieving task success. We will also
show that the additional annotation requirement
that they introduce can be successfully mitigated
using a novel pipe-lined Wizard-of-Oz data collection framework.
Policy Network and Database Operator
Database Operator
Based on the output pt
the belief trackers, the DB query qt is formed by,
where SI is the set of informable slots. This query
is then applied to the DB to create a binary truth
value vector xt over DB entities where a 1 indicates that the corresponding entity is consistent
with the query (and hence it is consistent with the
most likely belief state). In addition, if x is not
entirely null, an associated entity pointer is maintained which identiﬁes one of the matching entities
selected at random. The entity pointer is updated
if the current entity no longer matches the search
criteria; otherwise it stays the same. The entity
referenced by the entity pointer is used to form the
ﬁnal system response as described in Section 2.4.
Policy network
The policy network can be
viewed as the glue which binds the system modules
together. Its output is a single vector ot representing the system action, and its inputs are comprised
of zt from the intent network, the belief state pt
and the DB truth value vector xt. Since the generation network only generates appropriate sentence
forms, the individual probabilities of the categorical values in the informable belief state are immaterial and are summed together to form a summary belief vector for each slot ˆpt
s represented by
three components: the summed value probabilities,
the probability that the user said they "don’t care"
about this slot and the probability that the slot has
not been mentioned. Similarly for the truth value
vector xt, the number of matching entities matters but not their identity. This vector is therefore
compressed to a 6-bin 1-hot encoding ˆxt, which
represents different degrees of matching in the DB
(no match, 1 match, ... or more than 5 matches).
Finally, the policy network output is generated by
a three-way matrix transformation,
ot = tanh(Wzozt + Wpoˆpt + Wxoˆxt)
where matrices Wzo, Wpo, and Wxo are parameters and ˆpt = L
s is a concatenation of all
summary belief vectors.
Generation Network
The generation network uses the action vector
ot to condition a language generator . This generates template-like sentences
token by token based on the language model probabilities,
j−1, ot) = LSTMj(wt
where LSTMj(·) is a conditional LSTM operator
for one output step j, wt
j is the last output token (i.e.
a word, a delexicalised slot name or a delexicalised
slot value), and ht
j−1 is the hidden layer. Once
the output token sequence has been generated, the
generic tokens are replaced by their actual values:
(1) replacing delexicalised slots by random sampling from a list of surface forms, e.g. <s.food> to
food or type of food, and (2) replacing delexicalised
values by the actual attribute values of the entity
currently selected by the DB pointer. This is similar in spirit to the Latent Predictor Network where the token generation process is
augmented by a set of pointer networks to transfer entity speciﬁc information
into the response.
Attentive Generation Network
Instead of decoding responses directly from a static action vector ot, an attention-based mechanism can be used to
dynamically aggregate source embeddings at each
output step j. In this work we explore the use of an
attention mechanism to combine the tracker belief
states, i.e. ot is computed at each output step j by,
= tanh(Wzozt + ˆp(j)
where for a given ontology G,
and where the attention weights α(j)
are calculated
by a scoring function,
 r⊺tanh(Wr · ut)
where ut = zt ⊕ˆxt ⊕ˆpt
j−1, matrix Wr,
and vector r are parameters to learn and wt
embedding of token wt
Wizard-of-Oz Data Collection
Arguably the greatest bottleneck for statistical approaches to dialogue system development is the
collection of appropriate training data, and this
is especially true for task-oriented dialogue systems. Serban et al have
catalogued existing corpora for developing conversational agents. Such corpora may be useful for
bootstrapping, but, for task-oriented dialogue systems, in-domain data is essential6. To mitigate this
problem, we propose a novel crowdsourcing version of the Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) paradigm for collecting domain-speciﬁc corpora.
6E.g. technical support for Apple computers may differ
completely from that for Windows, due to the many differences in software and hardware.
Based on the given ontology, we designed two
webpages on Amazon Mechanical Turk, one for
wizards and the other for users (see Figure 4 and 5
for the designs). The users are given a task specifying the characteristics of a particular entity that they
must ﬁnd (e.g. a Chinese restaurant in the north)
and asked to type in natural language sentences
to fulﬁl the task. The wizards are given a form to
record the information conveyed in the last user
turn (e.g. pricerange=Chinese, area=north) and
a search table showing all the available matching
entities in the database. Note these forms contain
all the labels needed to train the slot-based belief
trackers. The table is automatically updated every
time the wizard submits new information. Based on
the updated table, the wizard types an appropriate
system response and the dialogue continues.
In order to enable large-scale parallel data collection and avoid the distracting latencies inherent in
conventional WOZ scenarios , users and wizards are asked to contribute
just a single turn to each dialogue. To ensure coherence and consistency, users and wizards must review all previous turns in that dialogue before they
contribute their turns. Thus dialogues progress in a
pipe-line. Many dialogues can be active in parallel
and no worker ever has to wait for a response from
the other party in the dialogue. Despite the fact that
multiple workers contribute to each dialogue, we
observe that dialogues are generally coherent yet
diverse. Furthermore, this turn-level data collection
strategy seems to encourage workers to learn and
correct each other based on previous turns.
In this paper, the system was designed to assist
users to ﬁnd a restaurant in the Cambridge, UK area.
There are three informable slots (food, pricerange,
area) that users can use to constrain the search
and six requestable slots (address, phone, postcode
plus the three informable slots) that the user can
ask a value for once a restaurant has been offered.
There are 99 restaurants in the DB. Based on this
domain, we ran 3000 HITs (Human Intelligence
Tasks) in total for roughly 3 days and collected
1500 dialogue turns. After cleaning the data, we
have approximately 680 dialogues in total (some of
them are unﬁnished). The total cost for collecting
the dataset was ∼400 USD.
Empirical Experiments
Training is divided into two phases.
Firstly the belief tracker parameters θb are

trained using the cross entropy errors between
tracker labels yt
s and predictions pt
s, L1(θb) =
s. For the full model, we have
three informable trackers (food, pricerange, area)
and seven requestable trackers (address, phone,
postcode, name, plus the three informable slots).
Having ﬁxed the tracker parameters, the remaining parts of the model θ\b are trained
using the cross entropy errors from the generation network language model, L2(θ\b)
j, where yt
j are output token targets and predictions respectively, at
turn t of output step j. We treated each dialogue
as a batch and used stochastic gradient decent with
a small l2 regularisation term to train the model.
The collected corpus was partitioned into a training, validation, and testing sets in the ratio 3:1:1.
Early stopping was implemented based on the validation set for regularisation and gradient clipping
was set to 1. All the hidden layer sizes were set to
50, and all the weights were randomly initialised
between -0.3 and 0.3 including word embeddings.
The vocabulary size is around 500 for both input
and output, in which rare words and words that can
be delexicalised are removed. We used three convolutional layers for all the CNNs in the work and
all the ﬁlter sizes were set to 3. Pooling operations
were only applied after the ﬁnal convolution layer.
In order to decode without length
bias, we decoded each system response mt based
on the average log probability of tokens,
t = argmax
{log p(mt|θ, ut)/Jt}
where θ are the model parameters, ut is the user
input, and Jt is the length of the machine response.
As a contrast, we also investigated the MMI criterion to increase diversity and
put additional scores on delexicalised tokens to encourage task completion. This weighted decoding
strategy has the following objective function,
t = argmax
{ log p(mt|θ, ut)/Jt−
λ log p(mt)/Jt + γRt}
where λ and γ are weights selected on validation
set and log p(mt) can be modelled by a standalone
LSTM language model. We used a simple heuristic for the scoring function Rt designed to reward
giving appropriate information and penalise spuriously providing unsolicited information7. We
applied beam search with a beamwidth equal to 10,
the search stops when an end of sentence token is
generated. In order to obtain language variability
from the deployed model we ran decoding until we
obtained 5 candidates and randomly sampled one
as the system response.
Tracker performance
Table 1 shows the evaluation of the trackers’ performance. Due to delexicalisation, both CNN type trackers and N-gram
type trackers achieve high
precision, but the N-gram tracker has worse recall.
This result suggests that compared to simple Ngrams, CNN type trackers can better generalise
to sentences with long distance dependencies and
more complex syntactic structures.
Corpus-based evaluation
We evaluated the
end-to-end system by ﬁrst performing a corpusbased evaluation in which the model is used to predict each system response in the held-out test set.
Three evaluation metrics were used: BLEU score
(on top-1 and top-5 candidates) , entity matching rate and objective task success rate . We calculated the entity
matching rate by determining whether the actual
selected entity at the end of each dialogue matches
the task that was speciﬁed to the user. The dialogue
is then marked as successful if both (1) the offered
entity matches, and (2) the system answered all the
associated information requests (e.g. what is the
address?) from the user. We computed the BLEU
scores on the template-like output sentences before
lexicalising with the entity value substitution.
7We give an additional reward if a requestable slot (e.g.
address) is requested and its corresponding delexicalised slot
or value token (e.g. <v.address> and <s.address>) is generated. We give an additional penalty if an informable slot is
never mentioned (e.g. food=none) but its corresponding delexicalised value token is generated (e.g. <v.food>). For more
details on scoring, please see Table 5.

Table 2 shows the result of the corpus-based
evaluation averaging over 5 randomly initialised
networks. The Baseline block shows two baseline
models: the ﬁrst is a simple turn-level sequence to
sequence model while the
second one introduces an additional recurrence to
model the dependency on the dialogue history following Serban et al . As can
be seen, incorporation of the recurrence improves
the BLEU score. However, baseline task success
and matching rates cannot be computed since the
models do not make any provision for a database.
The Variant block of Table 2 shows two variants
of the proposed end-to-end model. For the ﬁrst one,
no requestable trackers were used, only informable
trackers. Hence, the burden of modelling user requests falls on the intent network alone. We found
that without explicitly modelling user requests, the
model performs very poorly on task completion
(∼30%), even though it can offer the correct entity
most of the time(∼90%). More data may help
here; however, we found that the incorporation of
an explicit internal semantic representation in the
full model (shown below) is more efﬁcient and
extremely effective. For the second variant, the
LSTM intent network is replaced by a CNN. This
achieves a very competitive BLEU score but task
success is still quite poor (∼58% success). We
think this is because the CNN encodes the intent by
capturing several local features but lacks the global
view of the sentence, which may easily result in an
unexpected overﬁt.
The Full model block shows the performance of
the proposed model with different decoding strategies. The ﬁrst row shows the result of decoding using the average likelihood term (Equation 13) while
the second row uses the weighted decoding strategy (Equation 14). As can be seen, the weighted
decoding strategy does not provide a signiﬁcant
improvement in BLEU score but it does greatly
improve task success rate (∼3%). The Rt term
contributes the most to this improvement because it
injects additional task-speciﬁc information during
decoding. Despite this, the most effective and elegant way to improve the performance is to use the
attention-based mechanism (+att.) to dynamically
aggregate the tracker beliefs (Section 2.4). It gives
a slight improvement in BLEU score (∼0.01) and
a big gain on task success (∼5%). Finally, we can
improve further by incorporating weighted decoding with the attention models (+ att. + weighted).
As an aside, we used t-SNE to produce a reduced dimension view of
the action embeddings ot, plotted and labelled by
the ﬁrst three generated output words (full model
w/o attention). The ﬁgure is shown as Figure 3.
We can see clear clusters based on the system intent types, even though we did not explicitly model
them using dialogue acts.
Human evaluation
In order to assess operational performance, we tested our model using paid
subjects recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
Each judge was asked to follow a given task and
to rate the model’s performance. We assessed the
subjective success rate, and the perceived comprehension ability and naturalness of response on a
scale of 1 to 5. The full model with attention and
weighted decoding was used and the system was
tested on a total of 245 dialogues. As can be seen
in Table 3, the average subjective success rate was
98%, which means the system was able to complete
the majority of tasks. Moreover, the comprehension ability and naturalness scores both averaged
more than 4 out of 5. (See Appendix for some
sample dialogues in this trial.)
We also ran comparisons between the NN model

labelled with the ﬁrst three words the embedding generated.

and a handcrafted, modular baseline system (HDC)
consisting of a handcrafted semantic parser, rulebased policy and belief tracker, and a templatebased generator. The result can be seen in Table 4.
The HDC system achieved ∼95% task success
rate, which suggests that it is a strong baseline
even though most of the components were handengineered. Over the 164 dialogues tested, the
NN system (NN) was considered better than the
handcrafted system (HDC) on all the metrics compared. Although both systems achieved similar success rates, the NN system (NN) was more efﬁcient
and provided a more engaging conversation (lower
turn number and higher preference). Moreover, the
comprehension ability and naturalness of the NN
system were also rated higher, which suggests that
the learned system was perceived as being more
natural than the hand-designed system.
Conclusions and Future Work
This paper has presented a novel neural networkbased framework for task-oriented dialogue systems. The model is end-to-end trainable using two

supervision signals and a modest corpus of training

Wizard-of-Oz paradigm. We demonstrated that the
pipe-lined parallel organisation of this collection
framework enables good quality task-oriented dialogue data to be collected quickly at modest cost.
The experimental assessment of the NN dialogue
system showed that the learned model can interact
efﬁciently and naturally with human subjects to
complete an application-speciﬁc task. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst end-to-end NNbased model that can conduct meaningful dialogues
in a task-oriented application.
However, there is still much work left to do.
Our current model is a text-based dialogue system, which can not directly handle noisy speech
recognition inputs nor can it ask the user for con-
ﬁrmation when it is uncertain. Indeed, the extent
to which this type of model can be scaled to much
larger and wider domains remains an open question
which we hope to pursue in our further work.

an appropriate response based on the history and the DB result (bottom green). The DB search result is
updated when the form is submitted. The form can be divided into informable slots (top) and requestable
slots (bottom), which contains all the labels we need to train the trackers.
