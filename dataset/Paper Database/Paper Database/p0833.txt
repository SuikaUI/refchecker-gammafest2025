Improving chemical similarity ensemble
approach in target prediction
Zhonghua Wang1, Lu Liang1,2, Zheng Yin1 and Jianping Lin1,2*
Background:  In silico target prediction of compounds plays an important role in drug discovery. The chemical
similarity ensemble approach (SEA) is a promising method, which has been successfully applied in many drug-related
studies. There are various models available analogous to SEA, because this approach is based on different types of
molecular fingerprints. To investigate the influence of training data selection and the complementarity of different
models, several SEA models were constructed and tested.
Results:  When we used a test set of 37,138 positive and 42,928 negative ligand-target interactions, among the five
tested molecular fingerprint methods, at significance level 0.05, Topological-based model yielded the best precision
rate (83.7 %) and F0.25-Measure (0.784) while Atom pair-based model yielded the best F0.5-Measure (0.694). By employing an election system to combine the five models, a flexible prediction scheme was achieved with precision range
from 71 to 90.6 %, F0.5-Measure range from 0.663 to 0.684 and F0.25-Measure range from 0.696 to 0.817.
Conclusions:  The overall effectiveness of all of the five models could be ranked in decreasing order as follows: Atom
pair ≈ Topological > Morgan > MACCS > Pharmacophore. Combining multiple SEA models, which takes advantages
of different models, could be used to improve the success rates of the models. Another possibility of improving the
model could be using target-specific classes or more active compounds.

Background
In recent years, with the increasing cost of drug development and the inconsistent and slow speed of drug
approval, predicting new targets for approved drugs has
become a popular research area . It is well known
that drugs interact with multiple targets rather than
with a single target (called the off-target effect), and this
fact can be beneficial or harmful (known as side
effects or toxicity). Drug discovery methods that take
advantage of the polypharmacological nature of drugs
are becoming more popular , because drug discovery starting from approved drugs can benefit from the
elimination of many toxicological and pharmacokinetic
assessments.
With the ever-increasing public availability of bioactivity data , it is possible to construct reliable targetprediction models using statistical or machine learning
methods. Paolini et  al.  identified different types of
targets within the human pharmacological interaction
network using Bayesian classification models. Using
activity data from the ChEMBL17 database, Afzal et al.
 evaluated a multi-label multi-class classification
model and a single-label multi-class classification model.
In 2007, Keiser et  al.  developed the chemical similarity ensemble approach (SEA), which relates proteins
to one another based on the chemical similarity among
their bound ligands. Since then, the SEA and SEA-like
methods have been successfully applied in new target
identification for old drugs /natural products ,
for side-effect prediction and for the prediction of
potential anatomical therapeutic indications (ATCs) of
approved drugs . Moreover, studies have shown
that there is a startling difference between ligand-based

and sequence-based approaches, and in most case the
ligand-based similarity approach is more informative
for pharmacology than the sequence-based approach
 . Therefore, relating proteins on the basis of the
chemical similarity of their ligands, which is motivated
by the BLAST theory , rather than by their protein
sequences, could provide new insights into the relationships between structurally dissimilar but functional
related proteins.
An SEA model can be built based on different types of
molecular fingerprints. Hert et al.  evaluated the performance of several commonly used fingerprints in SEA,
and their results showed that ECFP_4 (extended connectivity fingerprint with radius equals 4) yielded the best
performance, but the others were comparable. Hence, the
chemical similarity criteria of small molecules play key
roles in SEA modeling. In this study, to investigate the
influence of different fingerprints, training data sets, and
activity thresholds on SEA models, we constructed five
SEA models based on five fingerprints—Morgan, Atom
pair, Topological, MACCS (molecular access system)
keys and Pharmacophore—and also a multi-voting SEA
model based on the 5 different fingerprint-based SEA
models. Finally, we tested the performance of the six SEA
Data sets and preparation
The ChEMBL database is a good open access data source
for drug discovery . In this study, the activity data
from ChEMBL19 were used for the training set, whereas
the newly reported activity data in ChEMBL20, compared
to ChEMBL19, were used as the test set. The following
steps were performed to create the training sets. First,
as shown in Fig. 1, molecules were curated by removing
salt and fragments and by filtering out molecules with
MWs (molecule weights) larger than 1000. Second, for
target-ligand pairs with multiple activity values, the geometric mean was used. Only targets labeled with SIN-
GLE PROTEIN were used, and targets with fewer than 5
ligands were also excluded; Third, three different activity
thresholds (pChEMBL values 5, 6, and 7—the pChEMBL
value is a ChEMBL-converted value, which is a negative
logarithm of the published activity , so 10 μm equals
a pChEMBL value of 5) were applied to generate three
datasets. Fourth, considering computational efficiency
and data balance, although SEA has a robust set size ,
3000 diverse ligands were picked for targets with ligand
set size exceeding 3000. To prepare the test set, the same
procedure was applied but with the difference that only
one activity threshold (pChEMBL ≥ 5) was used. In addition, to test the SEA on a specific protein family, a kinasespecific training set and a test set were created using the
same strategy from the kinase activity data of ChEMBL19
and ChEMBL20. Finally, six data sets—training sets with
activity thresholds 10, 1 and 0.1 µm, a test set, a kinase
training set and a kinase test set—were generated  (see
Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The data statistics are
shown in Table 1.
Similarity evaluation and performance validation
Only 2D structural similarities were considered in this
study. Six different molecular representations were calculated including Morgan (RDKit implementation,
similar to the ECFP/FCFP fingerprint ), Atom pair fingerprints , Topological torsions fingerprints, MACCS
keys fingerprints, 2D pharmacophore fingerprints and
SHED descriptors . The first five fingerprints are binary
vectors that encode the presence or absence of a predefined

feature (e.g., a fragment), and the SHED descriptors were
calculated based on the information-theoretical concept
of Shannon entropy to quantify the variability in a featurepair distribution . A SHED descriptor is a 10-dimensional array, in which each variable ranges from 0 to 20. The
average similarities of the 5 binary fingerprints and SHED
descriptors on the active molecules of 2089 ligand sets (of
different targets) from the training set were summarized in
the (see Additional file 7: Fig. S1).
For binary fingerprint similarity measurements, the Tanimoto coefficient (TC) was used, which is given by Eq.  1:
where S represents the coefficient, a and b are the on bits
of A and B, and c is common to both bits. Moreover for
SHED descriptors, the similarity of A and B is given by
where DIST(A, B) denotes the Euclidean distance between
The performances of each model were evaluated with
respect to accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity and
Fβ-Measure as shown in the Eqs. (3–7). The Fβ-Measure
is the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity. It combines precision and sensitivity in a single metric. More
specifically, the Fβ-Measure is a weighted harmonic
mean of precision and sensitivity in which β measures
the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who
attaches β times as much importance to sensitivity as precision. For example, the F0.5-Measure and F0.25-Measure
weights precision two and four times more than sensitivity, respectively. In this study, due to the incomplete
experimental evidence of the relationship of all ligandtarget pairs in both test and training data set, the multilabel classification problem, that a ligand may be active
against more than one target, was convert to binary
classification. Thus, the false positive rate obtained is
underrated, which will be discussed in the result section.
Under this circumstances, precision is more important
than sensitivity, therefore, two variations of Fβ-Measure,
F0.5-Measure and F0.25-Measure together with precision,
were mainly used to examine and discuss the results of
different models.

SEA model implementation
The procedures for building SEA models were derived
from a reference , with minor changes. Here, a brief
summary is provided. The chemical similarity of two sets
of ligands can be accessed by the sum of the chemical
similarities between each pair of ligands. However, this
process will render the value very sensitive to the size of
the data, to noise and to false positive data. To minimize
the influence of noise, the original SEA method introduced the Raw Score (RS) (Eqs. 8, 9), which was defined
as the sum of the ligand-pair TCs over all of the pairs with
TC ≥TS (Tanimoto threshold). Then, RS was converted
to a Z-score and P value (see eqs.10–14), which were
used to indicate the significance of the RS. In addition,
TS was determined by the best fitness of EVD (extreme
value distribution) using the chi-square test, indicating
that only significant similarities were considered contributions to set-set similarity. This work followed Keiser
et al.’s procedures to fit TS, with RS calculated for all
TC thresholds from 0.00 to 0.99 with a step size of 0.01.
As described in Fig.  1, after data curation, the background data sets were randomly created with set sizes
ranging from 10 to 1000 and an interval step of 10, which
results in 4950 pairs of molecular data set. Then, pairwise
RS of data sets were calculated, this RS calculation procedures is described in detail using its pseudo code (illustrated in Algorithm 1). This procedure was repeated 100
times. More details of the procedure can be found in the
original work .

Functions Fmean and Fsd were used to calculate the

for z ≥28 , computing ez exceeds the numerical precision of most programming languages, therefore a Taylor

Results and discussion
Activity threshold
Generally, 10 µm has been used as activity cutoff in many
works . However, to investigate the influence
of different activity thresholds, three SEA models were
constructed with activity thresholds of 10, 1 and 0.1 µm ,
respectively. All the three models were built based on
Morgan fingerprint. The result, as shown in Table  2,
showed that, at the significance level of P value ≤0.05, the
model with a threshold of 0.1 µm yielded the best precision of 95.8 % and specificity of 99.7 %, but a very low
sensitivity (true positive rate or recall) of 7.2 %; however,
the model with a threshold of 10 µm yielded the best
accuracy (67.6  %), sensitivity (38.2  %), and Fβ-Measure
(F0.5-Measure = 0.57, F0.25-Measure = 0.772). And the
performance of the model with 1 µm as threshold is in
between the above two models. This result should not
come as surprise because a higher activity threshold
indicates a higher quality of the training set, as well as a
smaller size of the set. It must be point that, of the 1190
* 26,489 ligand-target pairs in test set, Morgan model
with threshold 10 µm gave 65,772 pair of positive predictions (P value ≤0.05), and most of these predictions

haven’t been proved by experiment. Here we took a conservative estimate of the real result that the false positive
rate was underestimated. Therefore, in the following sections, F0.5-Measure and F0.25-Measure were used as the
measure. On the other side, at the significance level of
P-value ≤0.01, the precision, accuracy F0.5-Measure and
F0.25-Measure of the model with a threshold of 10 µm
reached at 91.6, 67.9 %, 0.684 and 0.883 respectively but
with the expense of reduction of sensitivity (33.9  %).
Thus, in practice, it depends on the researchers to decide
which model to use, according to the actual situation,
need broader alternatives of ligand-target interaction
pair for a few of potential molecule or a higher predictive accuracy rate for high-throughput target identification for a large molecule set. For consistency, hereafter
in this paper, unless otherwise specified, the models were
built using the training data set, filtered with an activity
threshold of 10 µm.
Fuzzy representation of compounds
The two-dimensional Pharmacophore fingerprint implemented in the RDKit package was employed to investigate the influence of the “fuzziness” of the representation
of compound structures in the SEA model. Details of the
definition can be found in the RDKit online document
( 
different levels of fuzziness were controlled by the number of
points of the pharmacophore and the shapes of the bins.
The fingerprint definition from Gobbi’s work , which
is also implemented in RDKit, was used in this study.
Table 3 demonstrates the target prediction performances
of 3 types of pharmacophore definitions. With the same 2
to 3 points in a pharmacophore, the comparison between
differently shaped bins showed that rougher bin selection,
indicating a fuzzier fingerprint, yielded higher sensitivity
(43.6 vs. 42 %) but lower accuracy rate (64.2 vs. 66.7 %),
precision (67 vs. 75.2 %), F0.5-Measure (0.61 vs. 0.65) and
F0.25-Measure (0.657 vs. 0.719). However, an “extremely
fuzzy” fingerprint with only 2 points in a pharmacophore was not sufficiently informative to build an SEA
model because it yielded a poor precision rate of 47.9 %,
which indicates the false positive rate is more than 50 %.
Pharmacophore-based fingerprints are a type of flexible
molecular representation because the definition of the
pharmacophore and the shape of the bin can vary, resulting in different levels of fuzziness. Fuzzy pharmacophores can also be used to identify compounds with similar
pharmacological functions but structural differences . The results in this section indicated that the fuzziness
of the pharmacophore impacted the performance of the
SEA greatly, and a well-designed pharmacophore scheme
might improve the performance significantly. In the following sections, pharmacophore fingerprint-based SEA
was built with point numbers of 2 and 3, and bin shapes
(2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7), and (7,20).
SHED descriptors and Euclidean distance
We also tested the probability of SHED in building an
SEA model. SHED is a pharmacophore-based descriptor
schema including 4 pharmacophore definitions—hydrophobic, donor, acceptor and aromatic—as well as 10
pairwise descriptors. As stated in the Methods section,
Euclidean distance together with a normalized Eq.  (2),
was used as a similarity criterion. Unlike with EVD, the
Z-scores achieved from SHED followed a Gaussian distributions more closely. Although SHED has been successfully used in some works , the test results in
this study showed that this type of schema is not proper
for SEA models with poor precision (45.4 %) as well as
F0.5-Measure (0.481) and F0.25-Measure (0.462), indicating that SHED, with 10 dimensional arrays, is not sufficiently informative to build an accurate SEA model.

SEA with different types of fingerprints
To analyze the predictive power of different fingerprints
in SEA models, in addition to Morgan and pharmacophore models, another 3 SEA models were also built,
including Atom pair, MACCS keys and Topological models. Table 4 shows the test results of 5 fingerprint-based
SEA models. The prediction precision rates of the five
fingerprint-based SEA models ranged from 75.2 to 83.7 %
(at a P value ≤0.05) or from 85.6 to 92.1 % (at a P value
≤ 0.01). More specifically, at significance level 0.05, The
Topological model yielded the best precision rate (83.7 %)
and F0.25-Measure (0.784) while The Atom pair model
yielded the best F0.5-Measure (0.694). Therefore, the
overall effectiveness of all of the models could be ranked
in decreasing order as follows: Atom pair ≈ Topological
> Morgan > MACCS > Pharmacophore. However, as can
be observed from Table 4, in general, all the five models
are comparable which consisted with previous work .
Multiple‑voting SEA model
Kogej et al.’s work demonstrated that much overlap
was observed in selecting compounds using different
fingerprints, and the combination of different fingerprints yielded better performance . Therefore, it was
worthwhile to determine whether combining multiple
SEA models could improve the predictive power. First,
we calculated the overlaps of the number of true positive
predictions of different fingerprint-based SEA models.
Table 5 shows that most of the predictions of different
models overlapped with each other. Taking Atom pairbased model as an example, of the 15,944 true positive
prediction, only 736 predictions overlapped with none
of the predictions from other models. This finding was
consistent with Kogej et al.’s work. Then, we constructed
a multi-voting SEA model, as described in the following.
To combine the 5 models, an election system was built
by employing the P-value of each model as a vote. For
example, if we took 3 votes into consideration (3-vote
scheme), a ligand-target pair was significant only if there
were more than three P-values less than the P-value cutoff from the five SEA models. The test results of the 1
to 5-vote SEA models are also included in Table 4. As
expected, it can be found that precision increase with
the vote cutoff of the model. Figure 2 presents the number of positive prediction, true positive prediction and
the accuracy rates of different vote schemes at significance level 0.05. The 1-vote scheme yielded 27,676 predictions, of which 19,644 were correct, and this number
was more than half of the test set. However, the precision rate was relatively low (71 %). In contrast, the 5-vote
scheme yielded a high precision of 90.6 % but a relatively
small number of positive predictions at 13,122 (11,882
were true positive). Moreover, with a significance level of
0.01, the 5-vote scheme yielded a high accuracy of 94.1 %
(see the Additional file 7: Fig. S4). Our results indicated
that combining different fingerprints did improve the
predictive performance of the SEA model. Because different fingerprints take charge of different aspects and
features of a compound, the multi-voting SEA could be
very robust (using a 1-vote scheme) for predicting target-ligand pairs and also accurate in its results (using the
5-vote scheme).

Kinase specific model
The Target class-specific model, by removing unrelated
protein families or noise information, should improve
the predictive performance. To confirm this assumption,
a kinase-specific SEA model was constructed using a
kinase training set based on Morgan fingerprint. When
running on the kinase test set (2,192 positives, 818
negatives), at significance level 0.05, the kinase-specific
SEA model outperform Morgan-SEA-5 in precision
100 vs. 94.8  %, but Morgan-SEA-5 model gave better
F0.5-Measure (0.667 vs. 0.326) and F0.25-Measure (0.843
vs. 0.621) result. Our results indicated that a target classspecific SEA model could improve the prediction precision rate, all positive prediction were correct in this case.
Therefore, a kinase-specific SEA model is useful and reliable (due to its high prediction accuracy) for capturing
target relationships within the kinase families. As stated
above, chemical similarity of the targets may not consist with their sequence similarity. For enzyme activity
classes, many targets were pharmacologically similar,
with the higher ligands chemical similarity, but sequence
dissimilar . Research has also shown that linkage
between two targets determined by chemical structural
similarity rather than protein sequence might be more
useful for drug discovery . Figure 3 shows a target relation network created using the kinase-specific
SEA model. For clarity of the graphic illustration, only
the most significant predictions are shown in the network (P value ≤10−80). Despite the connection inside the
subfamily of kinase, more than half (105 of 202) of the
connections were across kinase subfamilies. For example, serine/threonine-protein kinase PAK7 and AMPactivated protein kinase alpha-2 subunit share 374 active
compounds, and 16 of them are drugs; therefore there
is a linkage between these two targets, although they
are biologically unrelated (belonging to the STE protein kinase group and the CAMK protein kinase group,
respectively).

Conclusion
In this work, we tested different aspects of SEA models, with the purpose of improving the accuracy rate
of an SEA, indicating the activity threshold selection
and the use of class-specific sets. The results showed
that using stricter (activity cutoffs of 1 or 0.1 μm) and
more specific training data could improve the prediction accuracy rate of the SEA model but at the price
of a smaller number of correct, positive predictions,
indicating a higher false negative rate. To investigate
the fuzzy nature of fingerprints, 3 pharmacophore fingerprint-based SEA models were constructed and the
comparison indicated that fuzzy fingerprints can yield
larger numbers of predictions with overly rough representation, which could lead to very low accuracy rates
or even an impractical model. The comparison results
of five different models showed that the Topological
fingerprint-based SEA model outperformed the other
models with the highest precision rate, and the Atom
pair-based fingerprint yielded the greatest number of
correct, positive predictions. The overall effectiveness of
all of the models could be ranked in decreasing order as
follows: Atom pair ≈ Topological> Morgan> MACCS>
Pharmacophore. Although most of the predictions of
each model were overlapped, the multi-voting model
showed that combining multiple SEA models is a promising method for target prediction. With a tunable vote
number, the multi-voting scheme can be flexible in its
results, with either a high quality of prediction or a
greater number of potential alternatives. It should be
noted that the test results in this paper were optimistic
because the test set used consisted of newly published
data; thus, there were a great number of predictions that
could not be proved for now and were not considered in
the test results. Target-specific SEA could also improve
the prediction accuracy.
An inherent assumption that molecules with similar structures tend to have similar responses to a target
underlays SEA method. Thus, the challenge of improving SEA seems to be the same as “the traditional” ligandbased drug discovery methods, such as Quantitative
Structure-Activity Relationship or Virtual Screening.
These methods suffered from the problem of the activity cliff, which is defined as pairs of structurally similar
molecules with large differences in potency . Fingerprints capable of distinguishing these compounds 
could be used to improve SEA models.
