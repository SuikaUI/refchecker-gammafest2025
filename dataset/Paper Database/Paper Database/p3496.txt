J Work Environ Health 14 125-129. In two of his publications [Causal and preventive interdependence: Elementary principles. Scand J Work Environ Health 8 159-168 and Theoretical Epidemiology, John Wiley & Sons , New York, NY 1985], Miettinen put forth basic definitions of causal and
preventive interdependence of effects involving binary exposure indicators and outcomes. This paper shows
that the identification of interdependence using Miettinen's definitions varies with the choice of the reference
categories for the exposures. In particular, Miettinen's concepts of synergism and antagonism are not
invariant under exposure recoding. It is also shown that, when both exposures affect risk in some individuals, the effects will appear interdependent unde r some choice of referent. In the deterministic case,
invariant properties of joint effects may be identified through the formation of equivalence classes of
response types. In the stochastic case, invariant properties may be identified through the averaging of
individu al hazards, rather than risks. In both cases, additivity of risk or rate differences emerges as an
elementary criterion for the independence of effects.
Key terms: additive model, effect modi fication, epidemiologic methods, interaction, synergy.
The definitions of synergy, antagonism, and biological interaction have been the matter of some controversy in epidemiologic literature (1,3-14). Miettinen
(5, 6) put forth a set of definitions of causal interdependence o f effects based on individual disease outcomes under different exposure patterns as a solution
to the controversy. The present paper shows that,
under Miettinen's definitions, the interdependence of
effects varies with changes in the exposure reference
categories. Nevertheless, there are reference-invariant
properties of joint effects that can be studied, even in
the absence of " natural" reference categories.
Notation and definitions
To describe the basic concepts, suppos e that we study
two binary exposure variables, X and Y, each with possible values of I and O. The object of study is the impact of changes in X and Y on the risk of a binary
disease outcome D. For each individual i under study,
let rryi be a binary indicator for the individual's disease outcome when the exposure levels are x and y (for
example, r IO; = I if individual i gets the disease when
X = I and Y=0, but is zero otherwi se). Finally, suppose I is considered the "exposed" (index) value of

There are 24 = 16 possible types o f individual response patterns. Table I presents these 16 patterns.

effects, with both exposures causal), and types 3, 5,
7, and 9 were classified as instances of preventive interdependence. For example, an individual of type 8,
for whom disease occurs only if both exposures are
present, was defined as a synergistic responder.
Impact of change of reference category
Consider now what happens to the classification
scheme in table 1 when the index and reference categories of the second (Y) variable are interchanged. For
example, suppose we excluded individuals of indeterminate sex from our universe of discourse, and suppose that Y was sex, Y = 1 indicated "male," and Y =0
indicated "female." If we now redefine Y = 1 as
"female," individuals coded Y= 1 before would now
be recoded as Y = 0, and vice versa.
One consequence of the recoding of Y would be that
individuals classified as synergistic (type 8) responders
before would now be classified as antagonistic (type
14)responders. Thus the type of interdependence varies
with the coding convention. Note also that type 15responders, who were not classified as exhibiting interdependent effects in Miettinen's system, would become
type 12 responders, whom he classified as exhibiting
an antagonistic response pattern. Thus, when Miettinen's definitions are used, the classification of effects
as interdependent can also change upon recoding.
Without the adoption of a deeper theory about how
effects result, no reference category can be regarded
as correct. For example, gender is a powerful determinant of risk for many diseases, yet there is often no
basis for claiming that elevated risk among men represents causation of disease as a consequence of being
male (eg, testosterone) rather than prevention of disease as a consequence of being female (eg, estrogen).
In an analogous fashion, there will often be no basis
for claiming that the transadditivity of risk differences
seen when "female" is taken as the referent implies
synergism between maleness and the other factor, (cf
equation 3 in reference 5) rather than antagonism
between femaleness and the other factor.
Another implication of the effect of recoding is that
it is ambiguous to say that two variables act synergistically in much the same way that it is meaningless to
say a variable affects risk. The effects on risk are meaningfully defined in terms of the index and reference
levels of a variable (6) or factors corresponding to the
index levels.
In light of the preceding observations, it would seem
worthwhile to discover what, if any, properties of joint
action are invariant under recoding or changes in reference levels.
Invariant properties of response types
To find the invariant properties of the response types
in table 1, we will partition the types into equivalence
classes based on recoding of the exposure indicators.
Two response types (m and n) willbe defined as equivalent under recoding (or simply equivalent) if there exists
a one-to-one recoding of X and/or Y such that every
individual of type m becomes an individual of type n
upon recoding. For example, type 8 and type 14 are
equivalent because, upon recoding y as 1- Y (which
corresponds to interchanging the index and reference
categories for Y), type 8 individuals become type 14
individuals. Likewise, type 8 and type 15 are equivalent because, upon recoding x as I-x and y as 1-y,
type 8 individuals become type 15 individuals.
It is an easy algebraic exercise to verify that the
aforementioned relation is a formal equivalence relation: it is (i) reflexive, ie, type m is equivalent to
type m; (ii) symmetric, ie, if type m is equivalent.~?
type n, then type n is equivalent to type m; and (111)
transitive, ie, if type m is equivalent to type n and type
n is equivalent to type p, then type m is equivalent to
type p. Thus we can form mutually exclusive and exhaustive equivalence classes of types, the members of
each class being equivalent to one another but not to
members of other classes. There are seven such classes,
which we label as follows: (i) CD' comprising only
type I, the doomed type; (ii) Cx» comprising types 6
and 11, ie, both the types in which X = 1 is effective
but Y= 1 is not; (iii) C y, comprising types 4 and 13,
ie, both the types in which Y = 1 is effective b~t X = 1
is not; (iv) CM' comprising types 7 and 10, ie, both
the types exhibiting
mutual antagonism; (v) Cs,
comprising types 8, 12, 14, and 15, ie, all the types in
which disease occurs for only one exposure combination; (vi) Cp comprising types 2, 3, 5, and 9, ie, all
the types in which disease occurs for three exposure
combinations; (vii) C/' comprising only type 16, the
immune type. As we should hope, lack of an effect
of either or both factors (classes CD' CX, C y, and C/)
turns out to be invariant under recoding. In contrast,
of the earlier classification of types of interdependent
action, only mutual antagonism (class CM) remains
invariant under recoding. Causal synergism (type 8),
asymmetric causal antagonism (types 12 and 14), and
single-plus-joint prevention (type 15) turn out to be
equivalent to one another (class Cs)' Similarly, singleplus-joint causation (type 2), asymmetric preventive
antagonism (types 3 and 5), and preventive synergism
(type 9) turn out to be equivalent (class CT) . Thus
neither synergism, asymmetric antagonism, nor singleplus-joint action are invariant properties.
At first sight, the equivalence (within classes Cs and
C ) of two' types previously classified as exhibiting
interdependent action (synergism and asymmetnc antagonism) with a type previously classified as exhibiting independent action (single-plus-joint action) may
seem anomalous. However, type 2 can be viewed as
synergistic prevention by X =0 and Y =0, and type 15
can be viewed as synergistic causation by X = 0 and
Y = O. Thus failure to recognize types 2 and 15 as exhibiting interdependent action can be seen as a consequence of choosing X = I and Y = I as the "exposed"
categories, and nothing more. If this choice is arbitra ry, types 2 and 15 represent interdependence as
much as the other types in classes Cs and CT' All
types in class Cs (and no other types) can be viewed
as representing synergistic causation under recoding,
and all types in class CT (and no other types) can be
viewed as representing synergistic prevention under
Implications for incidence
Consider now a fixed population of individuals,
proportion
(Pm) of individuals of type
m (L I1lPm = I). Let Rxy be the proportion which becomes ill when X = x and Y = y . Miettinen (5) described
the mathematical relations among the differences
Rxy- Roo = RDxy implied by the absence from the
population of various response types. In an analogous
fashion, we will present mathematical relations among
the Rxy and Pm implied by the absence of certain
equivalence classes of types. It will be convenient to
employ Koopman's "interaction contrast" (3), which
is defined as
[=RD,,-(RDIO-RDo,)=R,,-RIO-Rul + Re/J·
= P3 + P, + 2P7 + PH+ PIS - Pz -
P~ - 2PIO - P,z - P,..
Suppose first that none of the types in classes representing causal interdependen ce (CM• Cs• and CT) are
present. This supposition is equivalent to assuming the
presence of types 1, 4,6, II , 13, and 16 only. Then
1=0, so that RD1I=RDIO + RDol . Miettinen
found the same additivity relation assuming no causal
interdependence, purely causal effects, and " perfect
negative correlation of susceptibilities. " These conditions are equivalent to assuming the absence of all types
but I, 4, 6, and 16. Our condition is slightly more general since it allows mixtures of causal and preventive
actions. More importantly, we have shown that this
relationship is invariant under the arbitrary recoding
of X and Y (ie, arbitrary exchange of reference and
index levels of the variables). Thus, under the deterministic model, departures from the additivity of risk
differences always imply the presence of types in one
of the equivalence classes representing interdependent
action, ie, CM' Cs, or C p
Type 2 is usually considered a possible response pattern , and so it is worth considering the situation in
which types in its class, c.,. are present. Suppose then
that only classes CM and Cs are absent, ie, that types
7, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 15 are absent. Then
P3 + Ps- P2 - P9, so that 1 is a contrast of proportions of all types in class CT' Thus departures
from additivity (ie, 1=1=-0) imply the existence of CT
types in the population (although not vice versa, since
1=0 if P3 + Ps= P2 + P9) . Again, this is a codinginvariant rule. Under the additional (noninvariant) assumption of no prevention, we find that min(RDIO +
RDOI, I - Roo) 2: RD112: max(RDIO, RDo,) as shown
by Miettinen (equation I in reference 5).
In an analogous fashion, if classes CM and CT are
absent , departure from additivity invariantly implies
the existence of Cs types. The additional nonin variant
assumption
min(RDIO RDOI) 2: RDII 2: max(RDIO + RDo1, - RDoo)
(equation' 2 in reference 5). Similarly, if classes Cs
and CT are absent , departure from additivity invariantly implies the existence of CM (mutual antagonism)
The stochastic case
For the stochastic case,
Txyi is now the individual
probability (risk) of disease at exposure level x, y ; in
other words, Txyi may now take on values between
zero and one. In what follows, the subscript i will, for
simplicity, be omitted. Miettinen (5) reasoned that the
independence of causal effects in this case corresponded to probabilistic independence of effects, ie,
Ti l =TIO + TOI-TIOTOI.· Letting Sxy= I-Txy, this condition may be rewritten as SII =S,05"OI' With the assumption that Sxy is strictly positive, we define the cumulative hazard hxy= -log.,sxy Then the independence
condition may be rewritten as hll =h lO + hOi ' This
condition is not invariant under recoding, since it
imposes no strict constraints on the relation of hoo to
the other hazards.
Consider now a situation in which the effects of the
exposures (X= I and Y= I) are probabilistically independent of any background causes, as well as of one
another's effect, so that SIO = SxSo, SOl = srSo, and Sj l =
sxsrSo' where sx, Sy. and So are the individual's probability of escaping disease produced by X exposure,
Yexposure, and other causes, respectively. This situation is equivalent to one in which the cumulative hazards follow the additive model hxy=ho + hxx + h yY,
where -hx• -h y, and -ho arc the natural logarithms of sx. Sy, and so' It is easily verified that this
additive structure is invariant under recoding (although
the value of ho and the signs of hx and h y will
Note that the aforementioned modelcan be rewritten
to incorporate preventive as well as causal action. For
example, if both X = I and Y = I are preventive, independent action may be defined as Soo=SxSrSl' where
sx, Sy, and Sl are the probabilities of escaping disease
produced by causes blocked by X = I, causes blocked
by Y = I, and other causes, respectively. Here Sx and
Sy would be interpreted as causal probabilities if X
and Y were recoded but would not change their numerical values.
Consider now a population of size N in which Hxy'
Hx, H y, and Ho are the mean values of the hxy, hx•
h y, and ho. The incidence proportion s RXY will approximate the H xy if the Txy are small, since in that
case Txy=hx.y' and so Rxy= LTx/N='i.hx/N = Hxy•
where the sums are over individuals. It is apparent
from the last equality in the preceding series that if
n; follows the aforementioned add itive model, then
R~y =H>y =Ho + Hxx + HyY. Thus for low-risk diseases the incidence proportions will approximately fol-
Iowan additive model (with coefficients Ho, H x and
H y) if, for all individuals, the study factors and
background factors act independently of one another;
this property is invariant under recoding. Equation 6
of Miettinen (5) also showed that an approximate additive model holds if the mean of the r lO"ol is negligible relative to R IO + Ro1' We have shown that this
result is invariant provided that all the r IO and " 01 are
also small (so that RXy=.Hxy), and that the exposures
act independently of background causes.

When the distribution of disease occurrence time is
of primary interest (as for most chronic diseases of
adults), the individual probabilities and hazards become functions of time, and the independent-action
model becomes sx/!) =sx(tYsY{t)Yso(t). This result
implies hxP) = ho(t) + hx<t)x + h y{t)y, where the h's
now represent instantaneous hazards [ie, the derivative of the cumulative hazard
- log"s(t) at t]. The
population mean H xy(t) of hx.v<t) at t is just the instantaneous incidence density at level x, y (2). Under
independent-action
H.ry(t) = Ho(t) +
Hx<t)x + H y{t)y, where Ho(t), Hx<t), and H y{t) are
means of ho(t), hx<t), and h y{t). Again, this additivity
of the incidence densities is invariant under recodin g.
Note however that the coefficients in this model,
Ho(t), Hx<t), and H y{t), may vary independently of
one another over time. Thus the model is much more
general than commonly used additive models, such as
Hx.v<t) = (I + b.x + b2Y)Ho(t), in which the coefficients maintain a fixed proportion to one another over
Unlike the results given by Miettinen (5), the preceding results emplo y the assumption that the actions
of the exposures are independent of background factors. With or without this assumption, the hypothesis
that the exposure effects are independent would be
refuted in principle if RD 11 does not fall between
max(RD IO, RD lO) and RDIO + RDo1 (5). With this assumption, however, the hypothesis of independent effects would be refuted in principle by any departure
of the instantaneous incidence densities from additivity.
Correspondence to the sufficient-component
cause model
The discussion thus far has concerned only the classification of biological processes according to their manifestations in individual risk patterns. A deeper theory
would begin with a classification of biological processes
from which these manifestations would be derived. The
simplest of these theories is perhaps the sufficientcomponent cause theory described by Rothman (7, 8).
This deterministic biological theory has some interesting relations to the equivalence classes given earlier
for the deterministic case.
Figure 1 presents the nine types of sufficient causes
possible under the sufficient-component cause theory.
Note that , whereas response types refer to individuals,
the cause types in figure I refer to causes. We will present a correspondence between sufficient cause types
and individu al response types.
We will say a person is "at risk" for (or susceptible
to) a parti cular type of cause if that person has all the
components of a sufficient cause of that type with the
possible exception of the components (if any) from X,
Y, or both. Note that a person is of one and only one
response type, whereas a person can be at risk of more
than one type of sufficient cause. Note also that, by
the definition of sufficient cause, only one sufficient
cause can be responsible for a particular occurrence
of disease.
We can form equivalence classes of these sufficientcause types by examining what types are mapped onto
one another upon the recoding of X, Y, or both. Upon
doing so, we find that there are four such classes: (i)
Vo' comprising only cause type 1, in which neither X
nor Y contribute a component; (ii) Vx- comprising
types 2 and 4, in which X but not Y contributes a component; (iii) V y, comprising types 3 and 5, in which
Y but not X contributes a component; (iv) V Xy,
comprising types 6-9, in which both X and Y contribute a component. The invariant properties are
simple, ie, no involvement of either variable, involvement of only X, involvement of only Y, and involvement of both. Sufficient causes in classes Vx and V y
represent independent action of X and Y, and causes
in class V X y represent coaction of X and Y (coparticipation in a sufficient cause).
Given a list of the cause types for which a person
is at risk, we can deduce the person's response type.
For example, a person at risk of cause type 1 will be
of response type 1, for that person will get the disease
regardless of that person's X or Y status; a person at
risk of cause types 2, 3, and no others will be of response type 2; and a person at risk of cause types 6,
7, 8, and no others will also be of response type 2.
The last two examples illustrate the fact that most
response types may arise from more than one set of
cause types. In this sense, the set of cause types for
which a person is at risk is not always identifiable given
the person's response type. Nevertheless, there are
several important exceptions to this rule. Each response
type in class Cs (types 8, 12, 14, 15) is produced only
by being at risk of exactly one cause type from class
Vxy (types 6, 7, 8, 9). For example, a person is of response type 15 if, and only if, that person is at risk
of cause type 6 and no others. Thus Cs' the response
class corresponding to synergistic causation, has a oneto-one correspondence with V Xy, the sufficient-cause
class corresponding to causal coaction.
A person is of response type 16 (no response under
any conditions) if that person is not at risk of any of
the cause types in figure I. Unfortunately, no other
one-to-one correspondences arise for the remaining 11
response types.
Discussion
Miettinen (5, 6) constructed his approach on the assumption that causal and preventive action could be
sharply distinguished as ontological concepts. In contrast, the present approach is based on a more general and primitive ontology in which causal and preventive actions are distinguished only by arbitrary
coding. It should be noted that the choice between the
two ontologies is not a matter of correctness, but rather
one of the degree of specification appropriate for the
existing state of knowledge. Certainly, a situation as
well elaborated as measles control, for example, calls
for a sharp ontological distinction between the preventive action of a vaccine and the causal action of the
virus. Such a degree of elaboration is certainly the
preferable one. But, as illustrated earlier for gender
effects, epidemiologists are often confronted with effects for which it is far from clear whether the mechanism of action should be classified as preventive or
causal (and thus for which it is also far from clear what
the appropriate reference and index categories should
be). In such situations it remains meaningful to ask
whether the effects of various factors are independent.
As previously demonstrated, partial answers to this
question may be obtained with estimates of rates or
average risks (just as in the more elaborated situation
considered by Miettinen), even if questions concerning
synergy and antagonism must be put aside.
It is interesting to note that, if the definitions and
the simplest causal models given in this paper are used,
additivity of risk or rate differences again emerges as
the most basic manifestation of independent effects.
Nevertheless, at least in the stochastic case, other concepts of independent effects may be possible, and these
would have different manifestations.
