We present Deeply Supervised Object Detector (DSOD),
a framework that can learn object detectors from scratch.
State-of-the-art object objectors rely heavily on the offthe-shelf networks pre-trained on large-scale classiﬁcation datasets like ImageNet, which incurs learning bias
due to the difference on both the loss functions and the
category distributions between classiﬁcation and detection
tasks. Model ﬁne-tuning for the detection task could alleviate this bias to some extent but not fundamentally. Besides, transferring pre-trained models from classiﬁcation to
detection between discrepant domains is even more difﬁcult
(e.g. RGB to depth images). A better solution to tackle
these two critical problems is to train object detectors from
scratch, which motivates our proposed DSOD. Previous efforts in this direction mostly failed due to much more complicated loss functions and limited training data in object
detection. In DSOD, we contribute a set of design principles for training object detectors from scratch. One of
the key ﬁndings is that deep supervision, enabled by dense
layer-wise connections, plays a critical role in learning a
good detector.
Combining with several other principles,
we develop DSOD following the single-shot detection (SSD)
framework. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012 and
MS COCO datasets demonstrate that DSOD can achieve
better results than the state-of-the-art solutions with much
more compact models. For instance, DSOD outperforms
SSD on all three benchmarks with real-time detection speed,
while requires only 1/2 parameters to SSD and 1/10 parameters to Faster RCNN. Our code and models are available

1. Introduction
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have produced

and Zhuang Liu were interns at Intel Labs China. Jianguo Li is the corresponding author.
vision tasks, such as image classiﬁcation ,
object detection , image segmentation , etc.
In the past several years, many
innovative CNN network structures have been proposed.
Szegedy et al. propose an “Inception” module which
concatenates features maps produced by various sized ﬁlters. He et al. propose residual learning blocks with skip
connections, which enable training very deep networks with
more than 100 layers. Huang et al. propose DenseNets
with dense layer-wise connections. Thanks to these excellent network structures, the accuracy of many vision tasks
has been greatly improved. Among them, object detection
is one of the fastest moving areas due to its wide applications in surveillance, autonomous driving, etc.
In order to achieve good performance, most of the advanced object detection systems ﬁne-tune networks pretrained on ImageNet . This ﬁne-tuning process is also
viewed as transfer learning .
Fine-tuning from pretrained models has at least two advantages. First, there are
many state-of-the-art deep models publicly available. It is
very convenient to reuse them for object detection. Second, ﬁne-tuning can quickly generate the ﬁnal model and requires much less instance-level annotated training data than
the classiﬁcation task.
However, there are also critical limitations when adopting the pre-trained networks in object detection: (1) Limited
structure design space. The pre-trained network models are
mostly from ImageNet-based classiﬁcation task, which are
usually very heavy — containing a huge number of parameters. Existing object detectors directly adopt the pre-trained
networks, and as a result there is little ﬂexibility to control/adjust the network structures (even for small changes
of network structure). The requirement of computing resources is also bounded by the heavy network structures.
(2) Learning bias. As both the loss functions and the category distributions between classiﬁcation and detection tasks
are different, we argue that this will lead to different searching/optimization spaces. Therefore, learning may be biased
towards a local minimum which is not the best for detection
task. (3) Domain mismatch. As is known, ﬁne-tuning can

mitigate the gap due to different target category distribution. However, it is still a severe problem when the source
domain (ImageNet) has a huge mismatch to the target domain such as depth images, medical images, etc .
Our work is motivated by the following two questions.
First, is it possible to train object detection networks from
scratch? Second, if the ﬁrst answer is positive, are there any
principles to design a resource efﬁcient network structure
for object detection while keeping high detection accuracy?
To meet this goal, we propose deeply supervised objection
detectors (DSOD), a simple yet efﬁcient framework which
could learn object detectors from scratch. DSOD is fairly
ﬂexible, so that we can tailor various network structures for
different computing platforms such as server, desktop, mobile and even embedded devices.
We contribute a set of principles for designing DSOD.
One key point is that deep supervision plays a critical role,
which is motivated by the work of . In , Xie et
al. proposed a holistically-nested structure for edge detection, which included the side-output layers to each convstage of base network for explicit deep supervision.
Instead of using the multiple cut-in loss signals with sideoutput layers, this paper adopts deep supervision implicitly through the dense layer-wise connections proposed in
DenseNet . Dense structures are not only adopted in the
backbone sub-network, but also in the front-end multi-scale
prediction layers. Figure 1 illustrates the structure comparison in front-end prediction layers. The fusion and reuse
of multi-resolution prediction-maps help keep or even improve the ﬁnal accuracy while reducing model parameters
to some extent.
Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
(1) We present DSOD, to the best of our knowledge, world
ﬁrst framework that can train object detection networks from scratch with state-of-the-art performance.
(2) We introduce and validate a set of principles to design efﬁcient object detection networks from scratch
through step-by-step ablation studies.
(3) We show that our DSOD can achieve state-of-the-art
performance on three standard benchmarks with realtime processing speed and more compact models.
2. Related Work
Object Detection. State-of-the-art CNN based object detection methods can be divided into two groups: (i) region
proposal based methods and (ii) proposal-free methods.
Proposal based methods include R-CNN , Fast R-
CNN , Faster R-CNN and R-FCN . R-CNN
uses selective search to ﬁrst generate potential object regions in an image and then perform classiﬁcation on
the proposed regions. R-CNN requires high computational
costs since each region is processed by the CNN network
separately. Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN improve the ef-
ﬁciency by sharing computation and using neural networks
to generate the region proposals. R-FCN further improves
speed and accuracy by removing fully-connected layers and
adopting position-sensitive score maps for ﬁnal detection.

Table 1: DSOD architecture (growth rate k = 48 in each dense block).
Proposal-free methods like YOLO and SSD 
have recently been proposed for real-time detection. YOLO
uses a single feed-forward convolutional network to directly
predict object classes and locations. Comparing with the
region-based methods, YOLO no longer requires a second
per-region classiﬁcation operation so that it is extremely
fast. SSD improves YOLO in several aspects, including (1)
using small convolutional ﬁlters to predict categories and
anchor offsets for bounding box locations; (2) using pyramid features for prediction at different scales; and (3) using
default boxes and aspect ratios for adjusting varying object
shapes. Our proposed DSOD is built upon the SSD framework and thus it inherits the speed and accuracy advantages
of SSD, while produces smaller and more ﬂexible models.
Network Architectures for Detection. Signiﬁcant efforts
have been devoted to the design of network architectures for
image classiﬁcation. Many different networks are emerged,
such as AlexNet , VGGNet , GoogLeNet ,
ResNet and DenseNet . Meanwhile, several regularization techniques have also been proposed to further enhance the model capabilities. Most detection methods directly utilize pre-trained ImageNet models as the backbone network.
Some other works design speciﬁc backbone network
structures for object detection, but still require pre-training
the network on ImageNet classiﬁcation dataset ﬁrst. For
instance, YOLO deﬁnes a network with 24 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers.
YOLO9000 improves YOLO by proposing a new network named Darknet-19, which is a simpliﬁed version of
VGGNet . Kim et al. proposes PVANet for object detection, which consists of the simpliﬁed “Inception”
block from GoogleNet. Huang et al. investigated various combination of network structures and detection frameworks, and found that Faster R-CNN with Inception-
ResNet-v2 achieved the highest performance. In this
paper, we also consider network structures for generic object detection. However, the pre-training on ImageNet is no
longer required by the proposed DSOD.
Learning Deep Models from Scratch. To the best of our
knowledge, there are no works which train object detection
networks from scratch. The proposed approach has very
appealing advantages over existing solutions. We will elaborate and validate the method in the following sections. In
semantic segmentation, J´egou et al. demonstrated that
a well-designed network structure can outperform state-ofthe-art solutions without using the pre-trained models. It extends DenseNets to fully convolutional networks by adding
an upsampling path to recover the full input resolution.
In this section, we ﬁrst introduce our DSOD architecture
and its components, and elaborate several important design
principles. Then we describe the training settings.
3.1. DSOD Architecture
Overall Framework.
The proposed DSOD method is a
multi-scale proposal-free detection framework similar to
SSD . The network structure of DSOD can be divided
into two parts: the backbone sub-network for feature extraction and the front-end sub-network for prediction over
multi-scale response maps. The backbone sub-network is a
variant of the deeply supervised DenseNets structure,
which is composed of a stem block, four dense blocks, two
transition layers and two transition w/o pooling layers. The
front-end subnetwork (or named DSOD prediction layers)
fuses multi-scale prediction responses with an elaborated
dense structure. Figure 1 illustrates the proposed DSOD
prediction layers along with the plain structure of multiscale predicting maps as used in SSD . The full DSOD
network architecture1 is detailed in Table 1. We elaborate
each component and the corresponding design principle in
the following.
Principle 1: Proposal-free. We investigated all the stateof-the-art CNN based object detectors, and found that they
could be divided into three categories. First, R-CNN and
Fast R-CNN require external object proposal generators like
selective search. Second, Faster R-CNN and R-FCN require integrated region-proposal-network (RPN) to generate relatively fewer region proposals. Third, YOLO and
SSD are single-shot and proposal-free methods, which handle object location and bounding box coordinates as a regression problem. We observe that only the proposal-free
method (the 3rd category) can converge successfully without the pre-trained models. We conjecture this is due to the
RoI (Regions of Interest) pooling in the other two categories
of methods — RoI pooling generates features for each region proposals, which hinders the gradients being smoothly
back-propagated from region-level to convolutional feature
maps. The proposal-based methods work well with pretrained network models because the parameter initialization
is good for those layers before RoI pooling, while this is not
true for training from scratch.
Hence, we arrive at the ﬁrst principle: training detection
network from scratch requires a proposal-free framework.
In practice, we derive a multi-scale proposal-free framework from the SSD framework , as it could reach stateof-the-art accuracy while offering fast processing speed.
Principle 2:
Deep Supervision.
The effectiveness
of deeply supervised learning has been demonstrated in
GoogLeNet , DSN , DeepID3 , etc. The central idea is to provide integrated objective function as direct supervision to the earlier hidden layers, rather than only
at the output layer. These “companion” or “auxiliary” objective functions at multiple hidden layers can mitigate the
“vanishing” gradients problem. The proposal-free detection
framework contains both classiﬁcation loss and localization
loss. The explicit solution requires adding complex sideoutput layers to introduce “companion” objective at each
hidden layer for the detection task, similar to . Here we
empower deep supervision with an elegant & implicit solution called dense layer-wise connection, as introduced in
DenseNets . A block is called dense block when all preceding layers in the block are connected to the current layer.
Hence, earlier layers in DenseNet can receive additional su-

pervision from the objective function through the skip connections. Although only a single loss function is required
on top of the network, all layers including the earlier layers
still can share the supervised signals unencumbered. We
will verify the beneﬁt of deep supervision in Section 4.1.2.
Transition w/o Pooling Layer. We introduce this layer in order to increase the number of dense blocks without reducing the ﬁnal feature map resolution. In the original design
of DenseNet, each transition layer contains a pooling operation to down-sample the feature maps. The number of
dense blocks is ﬁxed (4 dense blocks in all DenseNet architectures) if one wants to maintain the same scale of outputs.
The only way to increase network depth is adding layers inside each block for the original DenseNet. The transition
w/o pooling layer eliminates this restriction of the number
of dense blocks in our DSOD architecture, and can also be
used in the standard DenseNet.
Principle 3: Stem Block. Motivated by Inception-v3 
and v4 , we deﬁne stem block as a stack of three 3×3
convolution layers followed by a 2×2 max pooling layer.
The ﬁrst conv-layer works with stride = 2 and the other two
are with stride = 1. We ﬁnd that adding this simple stem
structure can evidently improve the detection performance
in our experiments. We conjecture that, compared with the
original design in DenseNet (7×7 conv-layer, stride = 2 followed by a 3×3 max pooling, stride = 2), the stem block can
reduce the information loss from raw input images. We will
show that the reward of this stem block is signiﬁcant for
detection performance in Section 4.1.2.
Principle 4: Dense Prediction Structure. Figure 1 illustrates the comparison of the plain structure (as in SSD) and
our proposed dense structure in the front-end sub-network.
SSD designs prediction-layers as an asymmetric hourglass
structure. For 300×300 input images, six scales of feature
maps are applied for predicting objects. The Scale-1 feature maps are from the middle layer of the backbone subnetwork, which has the largest resolution (38×38) in order
to handle the small objects in an image. The remaining ﬁve
scales are on top of the backbone sub-network. Then, a
plain transition layer with the bottleneck structure (a 1×1
conv-layer for reducing the number of feature maps plus a
3×3 conv-layer) is adopted between two contiguous
scales of feature maps.
Learning Half and Reusing Half. In the plain structure as
in SSD (see Figure 1), each later scale is directly transited
from the adjacent previous scale. We propose the dense
structure for prediction, which fuses multi-scale information for each scale. For simplicity, we restrict that each
scale outputs the same number of channels for the prediction feature maps. In DSOD, in each scale (except scale-
1), half of the feature maps are learned from the previous scale with a series of conv-layers, while the remaining
half feature maps are directly down-sampled from the con-

tiguous high-resolution feature maps. The down-sampling
block consists of a 2×2, stride = 2 max pooling layer followed by a 1×1, stride = 1 conv-layer. The pooling layer
aims to match resolution to current size during concatenation. The 1×1 conv-layer is used to reduce the number of
channels to 50%. The pooling layer is placed before the
1×1 conv-layer for the consideration of reducing computing cost. This down-sampling block actually brings each
scale with the multi-resolution feature maps from all of its
preceding scales, which is essentially identical to the dense
layer-wise connection introduced in DenseNets. For each
scale, we only learn half of new feature maps and reuse
the remaining half of the previous ones. This dense prediction structure can yield more accurate results with fewer
parameters than the plain structure, as will be studied in
Section 4.1.
3.2. Training Settings
We implement our detector based on the Caffe framework . All our models are trained from scratch with
SGD solver on NVidia TitanX GPU. Since each scale of
DSOD feature maps is concatenated from multiple resolutions, we adopt the L2 normalization technique to scale
the feature norm to 20 on all outputs. Note that SSD only
applies this normalization to scale-1. Most of our training
strategies follow SSD, including data augmentation, scale
and aspect ratios for default boxes and loss function (e.g.,
smooth L1 loss for localization purpose and softmax loss
for classiﬁcation purpose), while we have our own learning
rate scheduling and mini-batch size settings. Details will be
given in the experimental section.
4. Experiments
We conduct experiments on the widely used PASCAL
VOC 2007, 2012 and MS COCO datasets that have 20, 20,
80 object categories respectively. Object detection performance is measured by mean Average Precision (mAP).
4.1. Ablation Study on PASCAL VOC2007
We ﬁrst investigate each component and design principle
of our DSOD framework. The results are mainly summarized in Table 2 and Table 3. We design several controlled
experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 with our DSOD300
(with 300×300 inputs) for this ablation study. A consistent
setting is imposed on all the experiments, unless when some
components or structures are examined. In this study, we
train the models with the combined training set from VOC
2007 trainval and 2012 trainval (“07+12”), and test
on the VOC 2007 testset.
Conﬁgurations in Dense Blocks
We ﬁrst investigate the impact of different conﬁgurations in
dense blocks of the backbone sub-network.
Compression Factor in Transition Layers. We compare
two compression factor values (θ = 0.5, 1) in the transition
layers of DenseNets. Results are shown in Table 3 (rows
2 and 3). Compression factor θ = 1 means that there is no
feature map reduction in the transition layer, while θ = 0.5
means half of the feature maps are reduced. Results show
that θ = 1 yields 2.9% higher mAP than θ = 0.5.
# Channels in bottleneck layers. As shown in Table 3
(rows 3 and 4), we observe that wider bottleneck layers
(with more channels of response maps) improve the performance greatly (4.1% mAP).
# Channels in the 1st conv-layer We observe that a large
number of channels in the ﬁrst conv-layers is beneﬁcial,
which brings 1.1% mAP improvement (in Table 3 rows 4
Growth rate. A large growth rate k is found to be much
We observe 4.8% mAP improvement in Table 3
(rows 5 and 6) when increase k from 16 to 48 with 4k bottleneck channels.
Effectiveness of Design Principles
We now justify the effectiveness of the key design principles
elaborated earlier.
Proposal-free Framework. We tried to train object detectors from scratch using the proposal-based framework such
as Faster R-CNN and R-FCN. However, the training process failed to converge for all the network structures we attempted (VGGNet, ResNet, DenseNet). We further tried
to train object detectors using the proposal-free framework
SSD. The training converged successfully but gives much
worse results (69.6% for VGG), compared with the case
ﬁne-tuning from pre-trained model (75.8%), as shown in
Table 4. This experiment validates our design principle to
choose a proposal-free framework.
Deep Supervision.
We then tried to train object detectors from scratch with deep supervision. Our DSOD300
achieves 77.7% mAP, which is much better than the
SSD300S that is trained from scratch using VGG16 (69.6%)
without deep supervision. It is also much better than the
ﬁne-tuned results by SSD300 (75.8%). This validates the
principle of deep supervision.

SSD300* from scratch with ResNet-101 or VGGNet, which serves as our baseline. Note that the speed of Faster R-CNN with ResNet-101 (2.4 fps) is tested
on K40, while others are tested on Titan X. The result of SSD300S with ResNet-101 (63.8% mAP, without the pre-trained model) is produced with the
default setting of SSD, which may not be optimal.
Transition w/o Pooling Layer. We compare the case without this designed layer (only 3 dense blocks) and the case
with the designed layer (4 dense blocks in our design). The
backbone network is DS/32-12-16-0.5. Results are shown
in Table 3. The network structure with the Transition w/o
pooling layer brings 1.7% performance gain, which validates the effectiveness of this layer.
Stem Block. As can be seen in Table 3 (rows 6 and 9),
the stem block improves the performance from 74.5% to
77.3%. This validates our conjecture that using stem block
can protect information loss from the raw input images.
Dense Prediction Structure. We analyze the dense prediction structure from three aspects: speed, accuracy and parameters. As shown in Table 4, DSOD with dense front-end
structure runs slightly lower than the plain structure (17.4
fps vs. 20.6 fps) on a Titan X GPU, due to the overhead
from additional down-sampling blocks. However, the dense
structure improves mAP from 77.3% to 77.7%, while reduces the parameters from 18.2M to 14.8M. Table 3 gives
more details (rows 9 and 10). We also tried to replace the
prediction layers in SSD with the proposed dense prediction
layers. The accuracy on VOC 2007 test set can be improved
from 75.8% (original SSD) to 76.1% (with pre-trained models), and 69.6% to 70.4% (w/o pre-trained models), when
using the VGG-16 models as backbone. This veriﬁes the
effectiveness of the dense prediction layer.
What if pre-training on ImageNet? It is interesting to
see the performance of DSOD with backbone network pretrained on ImageNet. We trained one lite backbone network DS/64-12-16-1 on ImageNet, which obtains 66.8%
top-1 accuracy and 87.8% top-5 accuracy on the validationset (slightly worse than VGG-16).
After ﬁne-tuning the
whole detection framework on “07+12” trainval set, we
achieve 70.3% mAP on the VOC 2007 test-set. The corresponding training-from-scratch solution achieves 70.7%
accuracy, which is even slightly better. Future work will
investigate this point more thoroughly.
Runtime Analysis
The inference speed is shown in the 6th column of Table 4.
With 300×300 input, our full DSOD can process an image
in 48.6ms (20.6 fps) on a single Titan X GPU with the plain
prediction structure, and 57.5ms (17.4 fps) with the dense
prediction structure. As a comparison, R-FCN runs at 90ms
(11 fps) for ResNet-50 and 110ms (9 fps) for ResNet-101.
The SSD300∗runs at 82.6ms (12.1 fps) for ResNet-101 and

4.2. Results on PASCAL VOC2007
Models are trained based on the union of VOC 2007
trainval and VOC 2012 trainval (“07+12”) following . We use a batch size of 128. Note that this batchsize is beyond the capacity of GPU memories (even for an
8 GPU server, each with 12GB memory). We use a trick
to overcome the GPU memory constraints by accumulating gradients over two training iterations, which has been
implemented on Caffe platform . The initial learning
rate is set to 0.1, and then divided by 10 after every 20k
iterations. The training ﬁnished when reaching 100k iterations. Following , we use a weight decay of 0.0005 and
a momentum of 0.9. All conv-layers are initialized with the
“xavier” method .
Table 4 shows our results on VOC2007 test set.
SSD300∗is the updated SSD results which use the new data
augmentation technique. Our DSOD300 with plain connection achieves 77.3%, which is slightly better than SSD300∗
DSOD300 with dense prediction structure improves the result to 77.7%. After adding COCO as training
data, the performance is further improved to 81.7%.
4.3. Results on PASCAL VOC2012
For the VOC 2012 dataset,
we use VOC 2012
trainval and VOC 2007 trainval + test for training, and test on VOC 2012 test set. The initial learning
rate is set to 0.1 for the ﬁrst 30k iterations, then divided
by 10 after every 20k iterations. The total training iterations are 110k. Other settings are the same as those used in
our VOC 2007 experiments. Our results of DSOD300 are
shown in Table 4. DSOD300 achieves 76.3% mAP, which
is consistently better than SSD300∗(75.8%).
4.4. Results on MS COCO
Finally we evaluate our DSOD on the MS COCO
dataset . MS COCO contains 80k images for training,
40k for validation and 20k for testing (test-dev set). Following , we use the trainval set (train set + validation set) for training. The batch size is also set as 128.
The initial learning rate is set to 0.1 for the ﬁrst 80k iterations, then divided by 10 after every 60k iterations. The
total number of training iterations is 320k.
Results are summarized in Table 6.
Our DSOD300
achieves 29.3%/47.3% on the test-dev set, which outperforms the baseline SSD300∗with a large margin. Our result is comparable to the single-scale R-FCN, and is close to
the R-FCNmulti-sc which uses ResNet-101 as the pre-trained
model. Interestingly, we observe that our result with 0.5
IoU is lower than R-FCN, but our [0.5:0.95] result is better or comparable. This indicates that our predicted locations are more accurate than R-FCN under the larger overlap settings. It is reasonable that our small object detection precision is slightly lower than R-FCN since our input
image size (300×300) is much smaller than R-FCN’s (∼
600×1000). Even with this disadvantage, our large object
detection precision is still much better than R-FCN. This
further demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. Figure 2 shows some qualitative detection examples on COCO
with our DSOD300 model.

Better Model Structure vs. More Training Data.
emerging idea in the computer vision community is that ob-
Figure 2: Examples of object detection results on the MS COCO test-dev set using DSOD300. The training data is COCO trainval without the ImageNet
pre-trained models (29.3% mAP@[0.5:0.95] on the test-dev set). Each output box is associated with a category label and a softmax score in . A score
threshold of 0.6 is used for displaying. For each image, one color corresponds to one object category in that image. The running time per image is 57.5ms

ject detection or other vision tasks might be solved with
deeper and larger neural networks backed with massive
training data like ImageNet . Thus more and more largescale datasets have been collected and released recently,
such as the Open Images dataset , which is 7.5x larger in
the number of images and 6x larger of categories than that
of ImageNet. We deﬁnitely agree that, under modest assumptions that given boundless training data and unlimited
computational power, deep neural networks should perform
extremely well. However, our proposed approach and experimental results imply an alternative view to handle this
problem: a better model structure might enable similar or
better performance compared with complex models trained
from large data. Particularly, our DSOD is only trained with
16,551 images on VOC 2007, but achieves competitive or
even better performance than those models trained with 1.2
million + 16,551 images.
In this premise, it is worthwhile rehashing the intuition
that as datasets grow larger, training deep neural networks
becomes more and more expensive. Thus a simple yet efﬁcient approach becomes increasingly important. Despite its
conceptual simplicity, our approach shows great potential
under this setting.
Why Training from Scratch?
There have been many
successful cases where model ﬁne-tuning works greatly.
One may ask why should we train object detectors from
scratch. We argue that, as aforementioned brieﬂy, training from scratch is of critical importance at least for two
cases. First, there may be big domain differences from pretrained model domain to the target one. For instance, most
pre-trained models are trained on large scale RGB image
dataset, ImageNet. It is very difﬁcult to transfer ImageNet
model to the domains of depth images, multi-spectrum images, medical images, etc. Some advanced domain adaptation techniques have been proposed. But what an amazing
thing if we have a technique which can train object detector
from scratch. Second, model ﬁne-tuning restricts the structure design space for object detection networks. This is very
critical for the deployment of deep neural networks models
to resource-limited Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenario.
Model Compactness vs. Performance.
It has often been
reported that there is a trade-off between model compactness (in terms of the number of parameters) and performance. Most CNN-based detection solutions require a huge
memory space to store the massive parameters. Therefore
the models are usually unsuitable for low-end devices like
mobile-phones and embedded electronics. Thanks to the
parameter-efﬁcient dense block, our model is much smaller
than most competitive methods. For instance, our smallest
dense model (DS/64-64-16-1, with dense prediction layers)
achieves 73.6% mAP with only 5.9M parameters, which
shows great potential for applications on low-end devices.
6. Conclusion
We have presented Deeply Supervised Object Detector
(DSOD), a simple yet efﬁcient framework for training object detector from scratch. Without using pre-trained models on ImageNet, DSOD demonstrates competitive accuracy
to state-of-the-art detectors such as SSD, Faster R-CNN and
R-FCN on the popular PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012 and MS
COCO datasets, with only 1/2, 1/4 and 1/10 parameters
compared to SSD, R-FCN and Faster R-CNN, respectively.
DSOD has great potential on domain different scenario like
depth, medical, multi-spectral images, etc. Our future work
will consider these domains, as well as learning ultra efﬁcient DSOD models to support resource-bounded devices.
