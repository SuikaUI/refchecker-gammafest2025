PRESENTATIONS OF FAITHFUL D.G. NEAR-RINGS
by J. D. P. MELDRUM
 
1. Introduction
Many basic definitions and results in the theory of near-rings can be found in G.
Pilz (4). We follow these for the most part, except that we use left near-rings rather
than right near-rings. We follow exactly an earlier paper, Meldrum (2), where there
are detailed definitions and many results relating to faithful d.g. near-rings. Let I? be a
d.g. near-ring, distributively generated by the semigroup S, which need not be the
semigroup of all distributive elements. Denote such a d.g. near-ring by (R, S). Then
(/?,+) = Gp < S; 3?> where 02 is a set of defining relations in 5. Let (T, U) be a d.g.
near-ring. Then a d.g. homomorphism 6 from (/?, S) to (T, U) is a near-ring
homomorphism from R to T which satisfies SO C U. If (G, +) is a group, let T0(G) be
the near-ring of all maps from G to itself with pointwise addition and map composition. Let End G be the semigroup of all endomorphisms of G. Then (E(G),
End G) is a d.g. near-ring. A d.g. near-ring (R, S) is faithful if there exists a d.g.
monomorphism 0:(R, S)-^(E(G), End G) for some group G.
We now consider free (R, S) groups on a set X. For any d.g. near-ring, the free
(R, S) group on a set X exists and is denoted ¥r{X, R, S) (Section 2 of Meldrum (2)).
If X = {x} is a one element set, we write Fr(x, R, S) for Fr(A", R, S). A group G is an
(R, S) group if there exists a representation 0: (R, S) -»(E(G), End G), a d.g.
homomorphism defining an action of (R, S) on G. In this context free has its usual
universal meaning. The lower faithful d.g. near-ring for (R, S) is a faithful d.g.
near-ring (R, S) such that 0:(R, S)^(R,
S) is a d.g. epimorphism and SO = 5. Further
if 0 is any d.g. homomorphism from (R, S) to a faithful d.g. near-ring (T, U), then
0 = 0<t> for a uniquely defined d.g. homomorphism <f>. Lower faithful d.g. near-rings
always exist, as was shown in Meldrum (2), Theorem 4.3 and Mahmood (1), Theorem
2.1. We quote this result as follows.
Theorem 1.1. Let (R, S) be a d.g. near-ring. Then its lower faithful near-ring is
(R, S) = (R, S)IA, where A = {rE.R;Gr = 0}, and G is the free (R, S) group on one
generator.
In this paper, we consider d.g. near-rings (R, S). Then (R, +) has a presentation of
the form Gp < 5; 5? > , where 3? is a set of defining relations. We find conditions on
the presentation which are equivalent to the statement that (R, S) is a faithful d.g.
near-ring. This is then used to find the lower faithful d.g. near-ring in some simple

Finally we quote another result, Lemma 4.4. of Meldrum (2), which we will need
Theorem 1.2. Let (R, S) be a faithful d.g. near-ring, and let G = Fr(x, R, S). Then
G = Gp(x) * (R, +) is the free product of an infinite cyclic group with a group
isomorphic to (R, +).
We- remark that we could restrict ourselves to working within a variety "V of
additive groups as was done in Meldrum (2), and all the results will go over in such a
2. Faithful presentations
Definition 2.1. We call a presentation
a faithful presentation if (R, S) is a faithful d.g. near-ring.
Let us consider such a presentation of a d.g. near-ring (R, S), which is not
necessarily faithful. To simplify the statement of the next result, let u = (u\,...,
an r-tuple of elements of S, u' = (u\,...,
u',) be a t-tuple of elements of 5, and let
w(u), v(u') be two words in (u,,...,
ur) and (u\,...,
u't) respectively. The following
result is a key technical lemma.
Lemma 2.2. With the above notation,
H>(U) • u(u') = u(w(u) • u')
w(u) • u' = (H-(UW',), . . . , W(UH',))
Uu'j = (U,u'h . . . , UrU'j).
Proof. We use a double induction on the length n of the word w, and the length m
of the word v. First assume that n = 1 = m. Then w(u) = etult u(u') = T\\U\, where e{
and 171 are ±1, and M>(U) • v(u') — t\U\ • T\\U\ = e\i\\U\U\ = i7i(ei(Mi«i)). So the result is
true for n = 1 = m. Now assume that the result is true for n = p, m = 1, and let the
length of w(u) be p + 1. Then w(u) = »v'(u) + CM,, where e = ±1, and the length of w'(u)
is p. Then
= •'7I((H''(U)M'I + e(«,Mi)) as «i is distributive
= rfi(w'(u) • u\ + e(UiU\)) by the induction hypothesis
= i7,H>(u) • u\ = v(w(u) • «i).
This proves the result for all n s» 1 and m = \.

Now assume that the result is true for m = q and let the length of D(U') = q + 1.
Then u(u') = t/(u') + TJU;, where 17 = ±1 and the length of u'(u') is q. Then
w(u) • u(u') = w(u) • (t)'(u') + TJIIJ)
= w(u) • t/(u') + w(u) • TJMJ by left distributivity
= v'(w(u) • u') + 7)w(u) • u'j by the induction hypothesis
= D(W(U) • u').
This finishes the double induction and proves the result.
We now make precise the criterion for faithfulness in a d.g. near-ring which we
Theorem 2.3. The d.g. near-ring (R, S) is faithful if and only if an identity 1 can
be adjoined to R in such a way that the elements of S remain distributive in the larger
near-ring, (T,U) say, where U = SU{1}. Then (T, +) = Gp<l) * Gp<S>, where * indicates free product.
The first part of this result is a well-known characterisation of faithfulness applied
to this case. The second part follows from Theorem 1.2 or from Meldrum (2), Lemma
4.7. Now assume that (R, S) has a presentation as in Definition 2.1, and is faithful. Let
the relations be
» = <rA(s<A));AGA}.
By Theorem 2.3, (T, U) has a faithful presentation
Let F be the free group on S, G the free group on U and assume that U = S U{1}.
Then there is a natural embedding of F in G. Indeed we assume that F CG. As in
Meldrum (2), Theorem 2.1, we can define (F, S) and (G, U) as free d.g. near-rings,
using multiplication in S and U respectively, to define multiplication in F and G. The
natural embedding of F in G is a d.g. near-ring embedding. From the definition of
presentations, the kernel of the d.g. homomorphism 0:(F, S)-*(R, S), extending the
identity map on S, is H, the normal closure of 3? in F. The kernel of the d.g.
homomorphism <j> :(G, U)->(T, U), extending the identity map on U, is K, the normal
closure of Si in G. Also H is an ideal of F and K is an ideal of G.
If we now remove the assumption that {R, S) is faithful, the whole of the previous
work goes through with T = Gp<l> * (R, +). Then T = Gp(U). The only difficulty is
that we do not know whether the multiplication in U can be extended to make (T, U)
a d.g. near-ring. This can be done if and only if K is an ideal. Also (R, S) is faithful if
and only if (T, U) is a d.g. near-ring. Hence the question as to whether we have a
faithful presentation for (R, 5) is equivalent to the question as to whether K is an
ideal. As the ideal generated by a set of elements is important in this context we quote
the following result from Meldrum (2), Lemma 3.2.
Lemma 2.4. Let (R, S) be a d.g. near-ring, and let X = {xx; A G A} be a set of
elements in R. Then the ideal I of (R, S) generated by X is a normal subgroup of (R, +)

generated by
RXS = {rxxs, rxx, xxs, x A;A£A,r£J?,i£5}.
We now consider {G, U), the free d.g. near-ring on U, and we wish to establish
when K, the normal closure of 5? in G, is an ideal. If K is an ideal, then it will be the
ideal of (G, U) generated by 9i. By Lemma 2.4, the ideal / of (G, U) generated by 91
is the normal closure of
G9tU = {grxu, grx, rxu, rK; A G A, g G G, u G U}.
We do know that H, the normal closure of 9t in F C G, is an ideal of (F, 5). So rx and
rxs lie in H for all A G A, s G S. Since [/ = SU{1}, we deduce that rA« and rA lie in
H C K for all A G A, u G U. So we only need to consider elements of G of the type
grku, since 1 G (/ and so grA = grx 1 is of this type.
Let g = w(u) G G be an expression for g as a word in U. Let rA = rx(su ..., s,).
w(u)rA« = w(u)rx(su...,
= w(u)rx(S]U,...,
s,u) by Lemma 2.2.
r A0|W,..., s,u) = rx{su...
rA(siM,..., s,u)E.H. So we may omit u in the expression above without any loss of
generality. So we consider
w(u)rA(s,, ...,s,)=
rx(w(us,),
This is a word in su ..., s,, since u consists of elements in U = S U {1}. So w(u)rx G K
if and only if w(u)rA G iC D F = H. The fact that K D F = // is easy to prove. For the
homomorphism 9 from G to T, extending the identity map on U, has kernel K. When
restricted to FQG, 8 maps F onto RCT, with kernel //. Hence KC\F = H. Putting
all this together we get the following result.
Theorem 2.5. Let (R, +) = Gp(5; S?) be a presentation of the d.g. near-ring (R, S),
where & = {rx; A G A}. Then (R, S) is faithful if and only if
rx(w(usi),...,
for all A G A, w(u) G Fr(5 U {1}) - Fr(S), where H is the normal closure in Fr(S) of 01,
Fr(X) is the free group on X and rx = rA(Si,..., s,).
We now apply this result to obtain a presentation of the lower faithful d.g.
near-ring for a d.g. near-ring {R, S).
Let (R, S) be a d.g. near-ring with a presentation (R, +) = Gp<S; 3?). Let U =
S U {1} be the semigroup 5 with an identity adjoined, and let Fr(C7), Fr(5) be the free
groups on U, S respectively. Let H be defined as before, namely the normal closure
of 9L in Fr(S). Define Hn, for n 3= 1, inductively by:
Hn+i is the normal closure in Fr(5) of the set &„+! = {hn(w(ust),...,
w(us,)); all
K G Hn, hn = Ms,, • ••. *i). all w(n) in Fr(f/)}.

Obviously Hn C Hn+, for all n ^ 1. So_we can define H = \J%\ Hn, and it is a normal
subgroup of Fr(S). What is more, if h E H, then_/i E Hn for some n and so w(u)h Ej%n.n
by Lemma 2.2. So in Fr(U), we have Fr(U)HCH.
We now show that HSCH
induction. Certainly HS C 5 by definition of H, since (R, S) is a d.g. near-ring. Assume
that HnS C Hn. Let /in(w(us,),..., w(us,)) E &„+,, and let s £ S. Then
) , . . . , iv(ii5,))s = hn(w(usis),...,
w(us,s)) by Lemma 2.2 applied twice
= w(u)hn(sls,...,
s,s) by Lemma 2.2.
But hn(sls,...,s,s)
= hn(sl,...,s,)s
lies in Hn since hnGHn
and HnSCHn
induction hypothesis. Hence
»v(u)Ms,s, • • •, s,s) = MwCus,), • • •, w(us())
lies in 0?n+i. But
(—x + y + x)s = — xs + ys + xs
shows that since &tn+]SC. S?n+i, so Hn+], the normal closure of 9ln+\ in Fr(S), satisfies
Hn+lSCHn+l.
Hence HSCH
by induction. We now have almost proved the following result.
Theorem 2.6. Let (R, S) be a_ d.g. near-ring with a presentation (R, +) =
Gp<S; m). Define H as above. Then H is an ideal in (Fr(S), S) and (Fr(5), S)IH is the
lower faithful d.g. near-ring for (R, S).
Proof. By what we have done above, H is a normal subgroup of Fr(5), invariant
under left multiplication by Fr(t/) and right multiplication by S. Hence HU C H, since
U = SU {1}. So H is an ideal of (Fr(5), 5) and satisfies the conditions of Theorem 2.5.
Hence (Fr(5), S)IH is a faithful d.g. near-ring. Now suppose (Fr(S), 5)/L is a faithful
d.g. near-ring with LDH. Then L D Ht. Suppose L D Hn. Then hn E L for all hn £ Hn,
and as (Fr(5), S)IL is faithful, w(u)hn E L for all w(u)£ Fr(U) by Theorem 2.5. But
u'(u)hn = /in(w(ust),..., w(us,)), where hn = hn(st,...,
s,) by Lemma 2.2. Hence
J%n+i C L and so //„+, C Las L is a normal subgroup of Fr(5). By induction, Hn C L
for all n ^ 1 and so H C L. Thus (Fr(5), S)/L is a homomorphic image of
(Fr(5), S)IH. This finishes the proof of the theorem.
Although Theorems 2.5 and 2.6 are very unlikely to yield general results, they can
be used to good purpose in many special cases as we will now see.
3. Applications
The first result we will prove is the general version of a result we have used
already in two special cases, Meldrum (2), Theorem 3.3 and Meldrum (3), Theorem
2.7, and which we will use again later.
Lemma 3.1. Let (R, S) be a d.g. near-ring. Suppose S contains three elements
x, y, z such that x + y - z = 0 in R. If (R, S) is faithful, then - x - y + j t + y = 0.
Proof. We apply Theorem 2.5 with w(u) =1 + 1. Then x + x + y + y-z-z

J. D. P. MELDRUM
R. But x + y — z + x + y — z = 0. Comparing these two expressions, we obtain
x + y + y - z = y - z + x + y.
As y — z = —x, this reduces to
x + y — x = -x + x + y = y,
which gives us our result.
We now consider a special class of d.g. near-rings for which Theorems 2.5 and 2.6
take a simpler form, and which are useful as a source of examples. We call a near-ring
a zero near-ring if every product is zero. In this case all normal subgroups are ideals.
Definition 3.2. Let G = Gp(X; 3?) be a presentation for the group G. The presentation is said to be integrally closed if, whenever r = r(X\,..., xs) £ 5?, then
r(nxu . . . , nxs) is also a relation in G for all integers n.
This definition enables us to restate Theorem 2.5 for zero near-rings in a simple
Lemma 3.3. Let (R, S) be a zero d.g. near-ring. Then (R, S) is faithful if and only
if any presentation of R with generators S is integrally closed.
Proof. The proof consists of showing that in the statement of Theorem 2.5, we
can replace w(u) by nl for all integers n: Consider vv(us) = w(uts,...,
U],..., ut in U, say, where without loss of generality U\ = 1 while u2,...,
u, are in S.
Then u2s = • • • = u,s = 0 and so
= w(s, 0,..., 0)
Hence, vv(us) = nw(s) for some integer nw depending on H>(U). This corresponds to
replacing w(u) by nw\, where nw is the sum of the coefficients of 1 in the expression
for w(u). This is sufficient to prove the result.
This lemma also shows that in the case of an arbitrary zero d.g. near-ring, the
process described just before Theorem 2.6 to obtain the lower faithful near-ring for
(R, S) need only consider words w(u) of the form n 1, for all integers n.
Gp(x, y;2jc = «y = x + y + jc + y=0) of order 2n, and we assume that the distributive
generating set 5 contains x and y. We can say a good deal about the lower faithful d.g.
near-ring for {Ihn, S) without any further knowledge of the structure of S.
Theorem 3.4. Let (R, S) be a d.g. near-ring, let x, y lie in S and suppose that part
of a presentation for R is
(R, +) = Gp<Jt, y; 2x = ny = x + y + x + y = 0).
(i) // n is odd, then the lower faithful near-ring for (R, S) is GF(2), the Galois
field of order 2.
(ii) // n is even, and n\2 is odd, then the lower faithful near-ring is D4, the ring of
order 4 which is a homomorphic image of (R, S).

PRESENTATIONS OF FAITHFUL D.G. NEAR-RINGS
(iii) // 4 divides n, then the lower faithful near-ring for (R, S) is either D4, the ring of
order 4, or A the d.g. near-ring of order 8, in each case a homomorphic image of {R, S).
Both cases are possible.
Proof. Apply Theorem 2.6. In this case we choose w(u) = 1 + 1, and we take
x + y + x + y as the relation. Then
is a relation in the lower faithful .near-ring for (R, S), since x + x = 0. We also have
(i) If n is odd, then this forces y = 0, and we get the result since all rings are
(ii) If n is even, and nil = m, say, is odd, then this forces 2y = 0, and again the
result follows, since A is abelian, and so is a ring (Pilz (4), Proposition 6.6).
(iii) If 4 divides n, then A and A are both homomorphic images of D2n = (R, +).
As 4y = 0 in the lower faithful near-ring for (R, S), these are the only possibilities.
We now give two examples to show that both cases in (iii) are possible. In each
case the example will be a zero near-ring. In the first case we consider (An, S) with 4
dividing n, and with z = x + y in S. Then by Lemma 3.1 it follows that the images of x
and y must commute in the lower faithful near-ring for (D2n, S). This does not happen
in A , so the lower faithful near-ring for (A«, S) is A in this case.
In the second example we restrict S to be only {x, y}. The presentation is then
A = Gp(x, y; 2x = 4y = x + y + x + y = 0).
In checking whether this is a faithful presentation we only need to consider w(u) of
the form n\, n an integer, as we showed in Lemma 3.3. Obviously we get nothing new
from 2nx and 2ny, in the process described in Theorem 2.6. When we consider
x + y + jc + y we obtain nx + ny + nx + ny. If n is even, then nx = 0, and this word
reduces to 2ny, with 4 dividing In. If n is odd, then this word reduces to x + ny + x +
ny which is true in A already. Hence the presentation of A is integrally closed and
A is the lower faithful near-ring for (Am, S), if 4 divides m.
The final application concerns d.g. near-rings (R, S) where R is a finite simple
non-abelian group. By Pilz (4), Theorem 9.102, R is either a zero near-ring or has an
identity. By Pilz (4), Corollary 9.115(b) the second case cannot happen. So (R, S) is a
zero near-ring.
Theorem 3.5. Let (R, S) be a d.g. near-ring where (R, +) is a finite simple
non-abelian group. Then R is a zero d.g. near-ring. If the presentation for R is
integrally closed, then (R, S) is faithful. If the presentation for R is not integrally
closed, then the lower faithful near-ring for (R, S) is {0}.
Proof. We have shown above that (R, S) is a zero d.g. near-ring. Then, by Lemma
3.3, (R, S) is faithful if and only if the presentation for R is integrally closed. If (R, S)
is not faithful, then the lower faithful near-ring for (R, S) is a proper homomorphic
image of (R, S). As (R, +) is simple, this can only be {0}. This finishes the proof.
Each case can occur. We can use Lemma 3.1 to get the second case, as was done

in Meldrum (3), Theorem 2.7. On the other hand we can take S to consist entirely of
elements of order 2. If r(S),...,s,)
is a relation, then r(ns\,... ,nst) is either
r(0,..., 0) = 0 if n is even, or is r(s,,..., s,) if n is odd, which is already a relation. So
the presentation is integrally closed in this case. This may well be the only integrally
closed presentation for a finite non-abelian simple group, but we do not know the
answer yet.
