Abstract—Objective: To evaluate the utility of MRI hippocampal and entorhinal cortex atrophy in predicting conversion
from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer disease (AD). Methods: Baseline brain MRI was performed in 139
patients with MCI, broadly defined, and 63 healthy controls followed for an average of 5 years (range 1 to 9 years).
Results: Hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes were each largest in controls, intermediate in MCI nonconverters,
and smallest in MCI converters to AD (37 of 139 patients converted to AD). In separate Cox proportional hazards models,
covarying for intracranial volume, smaller hippocampal volume (risk ratio [RR] 3.62, 95% CI 1.93 to 6.80, p  0.0001), and
entorhinal cortex volume (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.79, p  0.0001) each predicted time to conversion to AD. Similar
results were obtained for hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volume in patients with MCI with Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) scores  27 out of 30 (21% converted to AD) and in the subset of patients with amnestic MCI (35%
converted to AD). In the total patient sample, when both hippocampal and entorhinal volume were entered into an
age-stratified Cox model with sex, MMSE, education, and intracranial volume, smaller hippocampal volume (RR 2.21, 95%
CI 1.14 to 4.29, p  0.02) and entorhinal cortex volume (RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.54 to 3.97, p  0.0002) predicted time to
conversion to AD. Similar results were obtained in a Cox model that also included Selective Reminding Test (SRT) delayed
recall and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Revised (WAIS-R) Digit Symbol as predictors. Based on logistic regression
models in the 3-year follow-up sample, for a fixed specificity of 80%, the sensitivities for MCI conversion to AD were as
follows: age 43.3%, MMSE 43.3%, age  MMSE 63.7%, age  MMSE  SRT delayed recall  WAIS-R Digit Symbol 80.6%
(79.6% correctly classified), hippocampus  entorhinal cortex 66.7%, age  MMSE  hippocampus  entorhinal cortex
76.7% (85% correctly classified), age  MMSE  SRT delayed recall  WAIS-R Digit Symbol  hippocampus  entorhinal
cortex 83.3% (86.8% correctly classified). Conclusions: Smaller hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes each contribute
to the prediction of conversion to Alzheimer disease. Age and cognitive variables also contribute to prediction, and the
added value of hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes is small. Nonetheless, combining these MRI volumes with age
and cognitive measures leads to high levels of predictive accuracy that may have potential clinical application.

High-resolution
T1weighted MRI allows precise assessment of these
structures. In AD, hippocampal volume is smaller
than in controls and is associated with greater dementia severity.2-4 Similarly, entorhinal cortex volume is smaller in AD vs controls.5,6

two measures did not differ in AD, suggesting that
the entorhinal cortex atrophies before the hippocampus in incipient AD.10 Autopsy studies in early AD
show neurofibrillary tangles in the entorhinal cortex
before hippocampal involvement.11
The predictive utility and relative merit of hippocampal12 and entorhinal cortex atrophy13 for MCI
conversion to AD are not established, partly because
of sample size limitations.6,13 Another clinically important issue is the predictive utility of these volumetric measures in relation to age, sex, education,

and cognitive measures.12-14 To address these issues,
we evaluated baseline MRI hippocampal and entorhinal cortex (and parahippocampal gyrus) volumes
in a single-site, long-term follow-up study of a large
cohort of cognitively impaired outpatients without
dementia and an age- and sex-matched control
Patients presented with memory complaints to the Memory Disorders Center at New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. The
majority (52%) were physician referred, 25% were self-referred,
and 23% were referred by family or friends or other sources. The
inclusion/exclusion criteria aimed at enrolling a broad sample of
cognitively impaired outpatients who presented with memory
complaints and were found to have cognitive impairment without
dementia based on comprehensive evaluation, but without a specific diagnosable cause for the cognitive impairment. Inclusion
criteria were age  40 years, cognitive impairment  6 months
and  10 years, and a minimum modified Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) score  40 out of 57 (Folstein MMSE  22
out of 30).15 Neuropsychological inclusion guidelines were Folstein
MMSE recall  2 out of 3 objects at 5 minutes, or a Selective
Reminding Test (SRT) delayed recall score  1 SD below norms,
or a Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Revised (WAIS-R) performance IQ score  10 points below the WAIS-R verbal IQ score.
Patients without these neuropsychological deficits were eligible if
they met all three of the following criteria: subjective complaint of
memory decline, informant’s confirmation of decline, and total
score  1 on the first eight items of the modified Blessed Functional Activity Scale.15
Exclusion criteria were a diagnosis of dementia, schizophrenia,
current major affective disorder, alcohol or substance dependence,
history of stroke, cortical stroke or infarct  2 cm in diameter
based on MRI, cognitive impairment entirely caused by medications, or other major neurologic illness, e.g., Parkinson disease.
Healthy controls were recruited primarily by advertisement.
Inclusion criteria were the absence of memory complaints, score 
27 out of 30 on the MMSE with recall  2 out of 3 objects at 5
minutes, and neuropsychological test scores not more than 1 SD
below age-adjusted norms. Medical, neurologic, and psychiatric
exclusion criteria were the same as for patients. Healthy controls
were group-matched to the patients on age and sex. All subjects
signed informed consent in this institutional review board–approved protocol.
Procedures.
The study neurologist/psychiatrist obtained history and conducted a general physical, neurologic, and psychiatric
examination. Laboratory tests included complete blood count, serum electrolytes, liver and renal function tests, thyroid function
tests, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory/rapid plasma reagin
tests, and serum B12 and folate levels. Apolipoprotein E genotype
was assessed, and patients were characterized as ε4 carriers (ε3/ε4
or ε2/ε4 or ε4/4) or ε4 noncarriers.
Patients and controls received annual neuropsychological testing, reviewed by an experienced neuropsychologist (Y.S.). Patients
completed the MMSE and SRT at intervening 6-month intervals.
At baseline, two expert clinical raters (D.P.D. and Y.S.) used neuropsychological performance, clinical and laboratory test results,
and the radiologist’s MRI clinical report to reach a consensus
diagnosis, while remaining blind to apolipoprotein E genotype and
MRI volumetric data. At each follow-up, a similar consensus diagnosis was made by the same raters who remained blind to data
from previous visits. The diagnosis of dementia was based on
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition criteria, and the diagnosis of possible or probable AD on
National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases
and Stroke–Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria.16 The endpoint of AD required a diagnosis of possible
or probable AD at two consecutive annual assessments. The consensus diagnosis was the primary outcome variable.
These inclusion/exclusion criteria and diagnostic procedures
remained constant throughout this prospective, longitudinal
study. Four years after this study began, the Petersen MCI criteria were defined.7 For the purpose of secondary analysis, based on
Petersen guidelines,7 MCI subtype was derived from the following
neuropsychological test data already collected at baseline: 1)
memory (verbal and nonverbal): SRT total and delayed recall,
Wechsler Memory Scale visual reproduction immediate and delayed recall; 2) executive functions: WAIS-R similarities, WAIS-R
Digit Symbol, letter fluency; 3) language: Boston Naming, Animal
Naming, Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Evaluation Comprehension,
Repetition; 4) visuospatial: Rosen Drawing Test, WAIS-R object
assembly, WAIS-R block design. As described elsewhere,17 age-,
education-, and sex-based regression norms for these tests were
calculated for 83 healthy elderly controls (included 63 controls
from this study). Using the criterion of  1.5 SD below these
norms on any test within each domain, the 139 patients with
complete MRI data were classified as MCI–amnestic single domain (n  21), MCI amnestic plus other cognitive domain deficits
(n  80), MCI–executive (n  2), MCI–language (n  12), MCI–
visuospatial (n  2), MCI–multiple domain deficits without memory (n  5), and non-MCI (cognitive deficits not meeting 1.5 SD
threshold, n  17).
MRI scan acquisition.
At baseline, each subject had a brain
MRI acquired on the same GE 1.5-T Signa 5X unit. The following
sequences were obtained: 1) T1-weighted sagittal scout images
using spin echo sequence with repetition time (TR): 550, echo time
(TE): 10, 5-mm slice thickness, 2.5-mm gap, matrix: 256  192 
1 NEX, and 24-cm field of view (FOV); 2) T1-weighted axial images parallel to the temporal horns using a spin echo sequence
with TR: 550, TE: 11, 5-mm slice thickness without gap, matrix:
256  192  1 NEX, and 24-cm FOV; 3) proton density and
T2-weighted fast spin echo coronal images, perpendicular to the
temporal horns, acquired with a dual echo sequence with an
8-echo train, TR: 4,000, TE: 17 and 102, 5-mm slice thickness
without gap, matrix: 256  192  1 NEX, and 20 cm FOV; 4)
three-dimensional coronal volume spoiled gradient recalled echo
(SPGR) sequence, perpendicular to the temporal horns, with TR:
34, TE: 13, flip angle 45 degrees, 2-mm-thick contiguous slices,
matrix 256  256  1 NEX, and a rectangular FOV of 24  18 cm.
MRI processing.
A single rater (G.P.) evaluated all scans on a
Sun UltraSPARC workstation blind to all clinical information,
using a dedicated software package (MIDAS) for image segmentation and coregistration.18 To evaluate hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex volumes, images from the
coronal SPGR sequence were realigned to a standard orientation
and reformatted using sinc interpolation to a 2-mm slice thickness
in the coronal plane. The standard alignment was based on the
interhemispheric fissure, the lens of both eyes, and in the sagittal
plane the line connecting the anterior and posterior commissures.
Some MRI scans did not have whole brain coverage with the
coronal SPGR sequence. Therefore, to estimate intracranial volume, the T1 axial 5-mm-thick images were reformatted using sinc
interpolation to sagittal images of 5-mm slice thickness. Supratentorial intracranial volumes were defined along the inner table of
the skull, and in midsagittal slices, the inferior boundaries were
the sphenoid bone and suprasellar region excluding the pituitary
gland and optic nerve or chiasm.
For the hippocampal volume assessment method, postmortem
anatomic validation has been reported.19 The lateral border of the
hippocampus was the medial wall of the temporal horn; the anterior boundary was the amygdala with the transition cortex between the amygdala cortical nucleus and hippocampus excluded
by making a perpendicular section at the level of the semilunar
gyrus. Anteriorly, the superior border was defined by the temporal
horn and fimbria, the medial border by the ambient cistern, and
the inferior border by the uncal sulcus and parahippocampal gyrus. More posteriorly, the hippocampal body’s medial boundary
was the transverse fissure, and its inferior boundary was the
parahippocampal gyrus (medial part of the subiculum if the uncal
sulcus was not visible). Because the interface between the lateral
portion of the subiculum and the hippocampus (Ammon’s horn)
cannot be distinguished, this portion was included in the hippocampus and not the parahippocampal gyrus (figures 1 and 2).
The parahippocampal gyrus volume included the medial portion of the subiculum, the entorhinal cortex, the transentorhinal
cortex, and the parahippocampal neocortex and white matter. The
medial border was the ambient cistern, and the inferior border
was the tentorium cerebelli (figure 2). In anterior sections, the
superior border of the parahippocampal gyrus was the hippocampus and the uncal sulcus. In more posterior sections, the superior
boundary was the hippocampus laterally and the transverse fis-

sure. The medial part of the subiculum (presubiculum and parasubiculum) was included in the parahippocampal gyrus volume. The
anterior and posterior boundaries of the parahippocampal gyrus
corresponded to the same level (slice) as the anterior and posterior
boundaries of the hippocampus.9 This approach standardized the
procedures across all subjects but may have led to exclusion of the
anterior-most and posterior-most portions of both structures.
The entorhinal cortex was assessed by estimating the volume
across three slices according to the method validated by Killiany
et al.6 First, the mammillary bodies were identified. The first
(most rostral) image displaying the fornix white matter tracts was
the center image, and the adjacent anterior and posterior slices
were then identified. The outline began at the angle formed by the
junction of the rhinal sulcus and the brain surface and then
transected the angle formed by the rhinal sulcus and the inferomedial brain surface. The line cut across the gray matter and then
followed the lower edge of the white matter to the inferior hippocampal surface and down along the brain surface to the initial
outline point (figure 3). The outlines used the same landmarks on
all three slices; the entorhinal cortex volume assessment averaged
15 minutes after identifying the correct image containing the
mammillary bodies.6 This method restricts the entorhinal cortex
assessment to the region where it is relatively large and the
boundaries are clear, enhancing reliability.
Statistics.
Analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, and 2
test were used to compare the demographic, clinical, and MRI
variables of patients (converters, nonconverters to AD) and controls. The t test was used for two-group comparisons of the MRI
variables. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to describe
relationships
neuropsychological
variables.
The time to AD was defined from the initial visit to the first
follow-up time-point at which AD was diagnosed. Primary analyses were conducted in the entire patient sample. Age-stratified
Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the separate effects of hippocampal, parahippocampal gyrus, or entorhinal
cortex volume (left  right), covarying for intracranial volume, on
the time to conversion to AD with and without further controlling
for sex, education, and baseline MMSE, as well as SRT delayed
recall and WAIS-R Digit Symbol scores, which were the strongest
among the hypothesized neuropsychological predictors of time to
conversion to AD, as reported elsewhere.20 Secondary Cox analyses were conducted in two subsamples of patients from within the
broad patient sample: the subsample with baseline MMSE  27
out of 30 (n  99) and the subsample with amnestic MCI (n 
101), which is the group at high risk of conversion to AD.
In all patients who completed 3-year follow-up or converted to
AD before 3-year follow-up, logistic regression analyses were conducted and sensitivities and specificities were calculated for receiver operating characteristic curves. For a fixed specificity of
80%, sensitivity was calculated. Percent correctly classified was
computed based on the threshold of 0.5 on the predicted risk
derived from the logistic model.
Demographic and clinical features.
months of presentation, two patients with MCI were diagnosed with other neurologic disorders (corticobasal degeneration, and ALS presenting with frontal lobe deficits) and
were excluded. MCI converters, MCI nonconverters, and
controls did not differ in sex distribution, years of education, and apolipoprotein E ε4 carrier status (table 1). MCI
converters were older and scored lower on baseline MMSE
than MCI nonconverters or controls (table 1). Two control
subjects cognitively declined and met criteria for amnestic
MCI during follow-up, and none converted to AD.

Interrater and intrarater reliability.
The single MRI
rater trained with expert raters (M.D.L., S.D.S., and S.S.)
and showed high interrater reliability on 10 scans (sum of
left and right volumes): hippocampal volume intraclass
correlation coefficient (ICC)  0.90, parahippocampal
gyrus volume ICC  0.96, and entorhinal cortex volume
ICC  0.92. The rater blindly re-rated 10 scans that she
had rated more than a year earlier and showed high intrarater reliability: hippocampal volume ICC  0.98, parahippocampal gyrus volume ICC  0.97, and entorhinal
cortex volume ICC  0.99.
Baseline hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus and
entorhinal cortex volumes.
MRI was conducted in 140 patients and 63 controls, but one patient and one control
were excluded because of extensive head motion. Hippocampal and entorhinal volumes were lower in patients
with amnestic MCI compared with the rest of the patient
sample and controls. In analyses of covariance restricted to
the 3-year follow-up sample to avoid converter/nonconverter bias, all three medial temporal lobe volumes (covarying

In patients, neither hippocampal nor entorhinal cortex
volumes were related to sex, education, or apolipoprotein E
ε4 carrier status. In patients, hippocampal volume decreased with age (r  0.33, p  0.001) and increased with
baseline MMSE (r  0.28, p  0.001), SRT delayed recall
(r  0.31, p  0.001), and WAIS-R Digit Symbol scores
(r  0.19, p  0.03). Entorhinal cortex volume decreased
with age (r  0.25, p  0.005) and increased with baseline WAIS-R Digit Symbol scores (r  0.18, p  0.04), but
not with MMSE (r  0.08, p  0.38) or SRT delayed recall
(r  0.12, p  0.16).
Follow-up.
Follow-up duration averaged nearly 5
years in controls (table 1). In patients, converters had
shorter follow-up because they exited the study after two
consecutive annual AD diagnoses (table 1). Of the 15

In the total patient sample (n  139), in separate agestratified Cox proportional hazards models with intracranial
covariate,
hippocampus (risk ratio [RR] per 1 mL volume reduction 
3.62, 95% CI 1.93 to 6.80, p  0.0001) and entorhinal
cortex (RR per 0.1 mL volume reduction  2.43, 95% CI
1.56 to 3.79, p  0.0001) were each associated with the
hazard of conversion to AD (table 2). After adjusting for
sex, education, baseline MMSE, and intracranial volume,
in separate Cox analyses, smaller hippocampal (p 
0.0012) and entorhinal cortex volume (p  0.0001) each
remained strong predictors (table 2). When both hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes were entered into the
same model covarying for intracranial volume, hippocampal (RR 2.98, 95% CI 1.55 to 5.75, p  0.0012) and entorhinal cortex (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.31, p  0.0007)
volumes were strong predictors. Similar results were obtained when both hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volume were included in an age-stratified Cox model after
adjusting for intracranial volume, sex, education, and
MMSE, but with reduced significance levels for hippocampal volume (table 2). In similar Cox models that also included SRT delayed recall and WAIS-R Digit Symbol as
predictors, entorhinal cortex volume remained highly significant, with less significance for hippocampal volume
(table 2).
The Kaplan–Meier curves (figures 4 and 5) indirectly
suggested that hippocampal atrophy showed progressive
increase in risk for conversion to AD across the range of
atrophy, whereas entorhinal cortex showed marked increase in risk mainly in those patients with volumes in the
lowest tertile.
In secondary Cox analyses in the 99 patients with MCI

smaller hippocampal (RR 3.44, 95% CI 1.61 to 7.35, p 

ble 2). In patients with amnestic MCI, entorhinal cortex
volume (RR 2.83, 95% CI 1.70 to 4.72, p  0.0001) but not
hippocampal volume (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.68 to 3.16, p 
0.33) remained a significant predictor when both entorhinal cortex and hippocampal volume were entered into an
age-stratified Cox model after adjusting for intracranial
volume, sex, education, and baseline MMSE (table 2).
For clinical relevance, further Cox analyses were conducted to estimate the relative risk of conversion in patients with hippocampal or entorhinal cortex volumes
dichotomized at 10% or 20% below the corresponding mean
volumes for control subjects (4.34 mL for hippocampus and
0.548 mL for entorhinal cortex). Covarying for intracranial
volume in each Cox model, for hippocampal volume 10%
below the control mean, the RR was 3.42 (p  0.001, 95%
CI 1.65 to 7.07, p  0.001); for hippocampal volume
20% below the control mean, the RR was 10.1 (p  0.0001,
95% CI 4.02 to 25.2); for entorhinal cortex volume 10%
below the control mean, the RR was 2.50 (p  0.05, 95% CI
1.03 to 6.06); and for entorhinal cortex volume 20% below
the control mean, the RR was 4.17 (p  0.0005, 95% CI
1.96 to 8.85).
In Cox analyses, parahippocampal gyrus volume predicted conversion to AD with intracranial volume as covariate (RR per 1 mL volume reduction 1.80, 95% CI 1.21
to 2.68, p  0.004). However, when both hippocampal and
parahippocampal gyrus volumes were entered into the
same model covarying for intracranial volume, both with
and without further controlling for sex, education, and
MMSE, hippocampal volume remained significant, but
parahippocampal gyrus volume was not significant. Parahippocampal gyrus volume was not a significant predictor
in any of the analyses that also included SRT delayed
recall and WAIS-R Digit Symbol as predictors, and was not
significant in analyses in the amnestic MCI subsample
that included demographic and cognitive covariates.
Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.
Logistic regression analyses were conducted in patients who
completed at least 3 years of follow-up or converted to AD
before 3 years of follow-up (31 converters out of 114 patients). In these analyses (table 3), for a fixed specificity of
80%, the sensitivities for MCI conversion to AD were as
follows: age 43.3%, MMSE 43.3%, age  MMSE 63.7%,
age  MMSE  SRT delayed recall  WAIS-R Digit
Symbol 80.6% (79.6% correctly classified), hippocampus 
entorhinal cortex 66.7%, age  MMSE  hippocampus
 entorhinal cortex 76.7% (85% correctly classified), age 
MMSE  SRT delayed recall  WAIS-R Digit Symbol 
hippocampus  entorhinal cortex 83.3% (86.8% correctly
classified).
Intracranial volume did not predict conversion by itself
(p  0.08), nor after adjusting for age (p  0.11) in the
logistic regression model, nor in the age-stratified Cox proportional hazards model (p  0.44).
Discussion.
This sample is larger than that in
other prospective longitudinal studies of MRI in MCI
outpatients and confirms most of the findings reported in smaller samples.6,12-14 Smaller hippocampal
and entorhinal cortex volumes each were highly significant predictors of time to conversion to AD. We
found that 1) hippocampal and entorhinal volume
contributed significantly to prediction when both
measures were evaluated in the same analysis; 2)
hippocampal and entorhinal volume contributed to
prediction over and above the effects of age and a
measure of global cognition (MMSE), as well as episodic memory (SRT delayed recall) and attention/
psychomotor/executive
Symbol); and 3) entorhinal cortex volume remained
highly significant even after controlling for age and
the cognitive measures, unlike hippocampal volume
that became less significant in prediction in similar
analyses partly because it correlated strongly with
these cognitive measures.6,21

follow-up sample, entorhinal cortex and hippocampal
volume each showed moderately strong predictive accuracy. The combined effects of hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes further improved predictive
accuracy. This indicates that each MRI measure independently contributes to prediction, but leaves
open the question of whether the entorhinal cortex
hippocampus
AD.1,10,13 Age and cognitive variables also contributed
strongly to prediction, and the relatively small added
value for prediction from the MRI volumes needs to
be weighed against the costs and expertise required

to obtain them. Nonetheless, combining the hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes with age
and cognitive measures did lead to the highest levels
of predictive accuracy for the various combinations of
variables that were evaluated (table 3).
The main findings held even in patients with
MMSE  27 out of 30, which is the group with minimal global cognitive deficits that often presents diagnostic and prognostic difficulties for the clinician.
This suggests potential utility for hippocampal and
entorhinal atrophy in predicting conversion to AD
even in patients with minimal to mild global cognitive deficits. Clinical and MRI radiologic readings
were used to exclude patients with stroke or cortical
or large lacunar infarctions, and it is unlikely that
the presence of cerebrovascular disease played a major role in conversion to AD. Memory impairment,
but not the degree of cerebrovascular disease, has
been shown to predict MCI conversion to AD.22
In the total MCI sample, for hippocampal or entorhinal cortex volume reduction of 10% or 20% compared with the control mean volumes, the RR ranged
from 2.5 to 10, indicating considerably increased risk
for even mild degrees of atrophy in these key medial
temporal regions. Hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volume loss ranges from 30% to 50% in studies of
AD compared with healthy controls,3,5,6,10 but it is
less severe in MCI, e.g., entorhinal cortex volume
loss 16% and hippocampal volume loss 8% in an epidemiologic study.10 In our 3-year follow-up sample,
mean hippocampal volume in converters was 11%
lower than in nonconverters and 14% lower than in
controls. Mean entorhinal cortex volume in converters was 17% lower than in nonconverters and 29%
lower than in controls (table 1). Another study
showed entorhinal cortex volume loss in MCI converters similar to mild AD patients.6 This magnitude
of volume loss has been validated by studies showing
that hippocampal atrophy during life is corroborated
by increased hippocampal neurofibrillary tangle burden after death.23,24,25
In MCI converters to AD, parahippocampal gyrus
atrophy was not a significant predictor in analyses
that controlled for demographic and cognitive variables.26 One possible explanation is that the parahippocampal gyrus is relatively large, and regions other
than its component entorhinal cortex (layer II is particularly vulnerable) may be relatively spared in
early AD. Some of the boundaries in the entorhinal
region of the parahippocampal gyrus can be difficult
to define, increasing variability. Also, the parahippocampal gyrus volume included white matter, and
the degree to which tissue loss extends into the
white matter in early AD is uncertain.27,28
Older subjects had smaller hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes. Hippocampal volume decreases with age, especially after 80 years,29,30 but
the effect of age on entorhinal cortex volume varies
considerably across studies.6,13,30 In autopsies of very
mild AD patients who were aged 60 to 90 years, no
significant entorhinal cortex neuronal loss was
found.23 In our study, age was a significant predictor
by itself, but it did not add materially to the prediction obtained from the combination of hippocampal
and entorhinal cortex volumes (table 3). Further,
apolipoprotein E ε4 allele carrier status did not alter
the predictive accuracy of these MRI volumetric
measures.5
This study has limitations. First, the results can
be applied only to outpatients presenting for evaluation of memory complaints, and not to the general
population. To improve clinical relevance, the inclusion/exclusion criteria broadly identified cognitively
impaired patients without dementia and without a
specific identifiable cause, thereby increasing heterogeneity. Most patients also met Peterson guidelines
for MCI7,8 and the main findings held in the subsample with amnestic MCI, though to a lesser degree, suggesting that the MRI variables may be less
useful predictors of conversion to AD in samples restricted to patients with amnestic MCI. Second, the
primary outcome of AD was based on clinical diagnosis, not neuropathology, and this may have led to
classification error. This limitation was tempered by
using expert raters who used strict diagnostic methods. Nonetheless, patients currently classified as
nonconverters may convert to AD with longer followup. Third, recruitment for control subjects was done
mainly by advertisement, which is not as optimal as
peer-nominated recruitment, e.g., family or friends
referred to be controls by the patients with MCI
themselves. The latter was attempted, though unsuccessfully, in most cases. However, control subjects’ data did not figure in testing the study
hypotheses.
Other structural MRI measures have been shown
to discriminate AD from controls: ventricular volume,14,21 whole brain volume,14 CSF volume,21 and
corpus callosum area.31 The predictive utility of these
measures for MCI conversion to AD is inconsistent
across studies,14,28,32 and intracranial volume did not
predict conversion to AD in our sample.
Serial MRI scans at annual or longer intervals
show that reduction in brain regional volumes discriminates AD from healthy controls4,33 and is associated with future cognitive decline in normal elderly
subjects.34 Serial images reduce measurement variability, increasing the likelihood of identifying differences over time. However, clinical practicality for
serial MRI imaging is limited because of increased
cost, complexity related to three-dimensional image
coregistration needed to assess atrophy rates, and
the clinical need to promptly establish the diagnosis.
Voxel-based morphometry,35 surface mapping of hippocampal subregions,12 and diffusion-weighted imaging36 are other MRI strategies that have been
studied in small samples, and their predictive utility
for MCI conversion to AD in large cohorts remains to
be established. Further, their predictive accuracy
compared to assessment of hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volume is unclear. In a recent crosssectional

complaints and neuropsychological test performance
that did not meet the MCI threshold had hippocampal volume loss intermediate between patients with
amnestic MCI and healthy controls, and medial temporal lobe gray matter loss comparable to patients
with amnestic MCI using voxel-based morphometry.37 This suggests that medial temporal lobe atrophy may precede the clinical diagnosis of MCI, but
longer term follow-up is needed to confirm this
hypothesis.
Other markers, such as decreased temporoparietal
metabolism with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)38 and PET amyloid imaging39,40
phosphorylated tau and decreased A 42 in CSF, are
known to distinguish patients with AD from controls.41 However, their utility in predicting MCI conversion to AD and their value in such prediction over
and above age and cognitive predictors are not well
established. Of note, a recent report suggests that
increased total tau and P-tau181 and decreased levels
of A 42 in CSF are strong predictors of MCI conversion to AD.42
