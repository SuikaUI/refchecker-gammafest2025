ABSTRACT The detection of abnormal electricity consumption behavior has been of great importance in
recent years. However, existing research often focuses on algorithm improvement and ignores the process of
obtaining features. The optimal feature set, which reﬂects customers’ electricity consumption behavior, has
a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the ﬁnal detection results. Moreover, it is not straightforward to obtain datasets
with label information. In this paper, a method based on feature engineering for unsupervised detection
of abnormal electricity consumption behavior is proposed. First, the original feature set is constructed by
brainstorming in the feature engineering step. Then, the optimal feature set, which reﬂects the customers’
electricity consumption behavior, is obtained by features selected based on the variance and similarity
between them. After that, in the abnormal detection step, a density-based clustering algorithm, in which
the best clustering parameters are selected through iteration and evaluation, combined with unsupervised
clustering evaluation indexes, is used to detect abnormal electricity consumption behaviors. Finally, using the
load dataset of an industrial park, several typical feature strategies are applied for comparison with the feature
engineering proposed in this paper. To perform the evaluation, the label information of abnormal behaviors
is obtained by combining the original electricity consumption behavior detection results with abnormal data
injections. The abnormal detection method proposed has given good results and outperformed typical feature
strategies in an effective and generalizable way.

I. INTRODUCTION
With the widespread use of smart meters and the continuous development of advanced metering infrastructures
(AMI), utilities are able to acquire ﬁne-grained data about the
real electricity consumption of end-users , . Moreover,
research on anomaly detection for electricity consumption
behavior based on data from smart meters has gained extensive attention , . Anomaly detection can regulate customers’ electricity consumption behavior, reduce the losses
of power utilities, and maintain the security of the smart
grid , . The data from smart meters indirectly reﬂect
customers’ electricity consumption behavior, and the essence
of anomalous behavior detection is to distinguish abnormal
data in the electricity consumption dataset , . Generally,
The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and
approving it for publication was Canbing Li
the data in abnormal detection include bad data and nontechnical loss (NTL) data, which are directly reﬂected in the
readings of smart meters. Nevertheless, there are fundamental
differences between bad data and NTL data. Bad data include
missing data as well as abnormal electricity consumption
patterns caused by force majeure in the process of data collection, transmission, temporary power outages, or business
rectiﬁcation . The generation of bad data is inevitable,
objective, and temporary. The data in NTL are generated
by electricity theft under speciﬁc strategies, including meter
tampering, network intrusion, and measurement interruption,
which have the characteristics of continuity, subjectivity, and
illegality .
The problems with bad data, such as missing data, repeated
data, and exceptions, are easy to ﬁnd and handle in the process
of data cleaning . However, because of the large amount
of data, distinguishing bad data manually without a uniﬁed

standard is subjective, and abnormal electricity consumption
patterns in bad data cannot be distinguished effectively from
normal patterns. At the same time, unplanned electricity consumption in bad data and electricity theft in NTL have similar
performance on load curves and similar detection methods.
Therefore, the abnormal electricity consumption patterns in
bad data and electricity theft in NTL all belong to the category
of abnormal electricity consumption behavior.
Current research on abnormal electricity consumption
behavior detection generally follows the process of ‘‘feature
acquisition—abnormal detection’’ – . A feature, also
called an attribute or variable, represents a property of a
process or system that has been measured or constructed from
the original input variables . Through different feature
strategies, a series of electricity consumption behavior features are obtained from the data set and are used to train
classiﬁers or to perform cluster analysis. However, existing
research mainly focuses on the improvement of classiﬁcation
and clustering algorithms, while research on feature strategies
is not a popular issue. ‘‘Data and features determine the
upper limit of machine learning, while models and algorithms only approach this upper limit’’ . The feature set,
which can reﬂect customers’ electricity consumption behavior based on load data, has played a decisive role in follow-up
research . In fact, in two recent research reviews , ,
feature engineering is considered to be a challenging ﬁeld that
has been ignored in previous studies.
Feature engineering mainly focuses on the mining and
analysis of electricity consumption and load data in the existing research. Features can be divided into two categories
according to whether they are interpretable. One is the category of interpretable features, such as the variability index,
the daily average load, and the peak-to-valley time. These
features generally rely on professional knowledge to execute
feature construction or adopt speciﬁc strategies to select features from the commonly used electricity consumption feature set. The other is the category of noninterpretable features
generated by machine learning or deep learning algorithms,
such as a deep conﬁdence network , an autoencoder ,
or a convolutional neural network . Obtaining a feature
set that can reﬂect customers’ electricity consumption is
the ﬁrst step in detecting abnormal electricity consumption.
The features obtained by different feature strategies lead to
vast differences in the evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms – . At present, there are several problems in the
research of customer electricity use features. The process of
constructing the electricity behavior feature set relies heavily
on professional knowledge. Features selected by experience
have the disadvantages of subjectivity and one-sidedness.
Additionally, customers have inherent electricity consumption characteristics, and uniﬁed selection of features ignores
the differences between customers and can lead to the loss of
crucial information. Deep learning algorithms are a popular
research topic in feature engineering and are very effective
on feature engineering datasets. However, almost all of them
are based on a sample data set and require the dataset with
labels for model training in supervised learning. The number
of layers and parameters of deep learning algorithms means
that researchers must carry out experiments continuously,
and the extracted features are not interpretable. The deep
learning algorithms cannot be adjusted adaptively and have
some limitations when facing a new dataset.
After feature acquisition, the methods of detection can be
divided into supervised and unsupervised methods according
to whether label information is available in the dataset. Supervised methods include various classiﬁers and neural network
models, such as support vector machines , , extreme
learning machines , random forests , and deep learning algorithms. Unsupervised methods primarily include a
variety of clustering algorithms, e.g., k-means clustering ,
fuzzy clustering , and other improved clustering methods , , . However, as mentioned above, the labels
of abnormal electricity consumption data in most datasets are
difﬁcult to obtain. Moreover, there is no standard to judge
whether the customer data represent normal electricity consumption behavior and manual labeling is difﬁcult to work
that lacks reliability . Therefore, supervised methods have
certain limitations in practice, and unsupervised methods are
more suitable for actual needs.
In order to solve the above problems of features acquisition in abnormal electricity consumption behavior detection, an unsupervised abnormal detection method based on
feature engineering for electricity consumption behaviors
is proposed. The proposed method consists of three parts:
data preparation, feature engineering, and anomaly detection.
First, data preprocessing is carried out to clean the data, and it
is a vital and indispensable step. Next, through feature engineering, the optimal feature subset that reﬂects consumers’
energy consumption behavior is obtained. Then, the best
clustering parameters are found by iterative evaluation and
cluster evaluation. Finally, anomaly detection is performed by
a density-based clustering algorithm. The proposed method
is based on unsupervised learning and does not rely on subjective experience and data. The optimal feature set obtained
by the proposed method can comprehensively and objectively
reﬂect the user’s electricity consumption behavior, and realize abnormal detection.

II. RELATED WORK
This section discusses the related concepts about feature
engineering and provides a brief review of the existing studies
of feature engineering in abnormal electricity consumption
detection.
A. FEATURE ENGINEERING
Feature engineering is the process of using data science
knowledge to create feature sets that enable machine learning algorithms to achieve the best performance. Generally, the essence of feature engineering is to transform the
preprocessed data, which includes three subproblems: feature construction (FC), feature extraction (FE), and feature
selection (FS). The place of feature engineering in the process
of data mining is shown in Fig. 1.
FC is based on the original dataset and relies on professional experience to build new features, which are generally interpretable. Usually, the process of FC requires much
time to study data samples as well as particular abilities of
insight and analysis. For power data, FC needs background
information on the power industry, which relies on experience and subjective judgment. The task of FS is to select a
feature subset from the original feature set based on speciﬁc
evaluation criteria , . The number of elements in the
feature subset should be less than that in the original feature
set. In essence, FS is a dimensionality reduction process, and
the features themselves do not change. A good FS algorithm
can effectively reduce the original feature set dimension, has
low computational complexity, and can improve the effectiveness of subsequent classiﬁcation and clustering . Similar
to FS, FE also reduces the dimension of the original feature
set. Through dimension reduction, mapping, and other methods, FE keeps the original data information to as great an
extent as possible and obtains more abstract and concise feature representation. Common FE methods include PCA, independent component analysis (ICA) and linear discriminant
analysis (LDA). Unlike FS, the data themselves will change
in the process of FE. Let F ∈Rd×n be a feature set with n features as
f 1, . . . , f i, . . . , f n
, where f i ∈Rd×1. The process
of FS is as follows:
f 1, . . . , f i, . . . , f n
f i1, . . . , f ij, . . . , f im
where ij ∈{1, . . . , n} , j ∈{1, . . . , m}, a = b can be deduced
when ia = ib and a, b ∈{1, . . . , m}. The process of FE is as
f 1, . . ., f i, . . . ,f n
−→{g1 (F) , . . . ,gi (F) , . . . ,gm (F)}
where gi (F) represents the transformation of feature set F by
a series of FE methods, such as PCA, ICA, and LDA. In most
cases, not all three subproblems of feature engineering are
carried out, but one or two of them are selected according to
the needs of model building and analysis.
B. FEATURE CONSTRUCTION AND EXTRACTION
Feature construction and feature extraction are used to build
feature vectors of consumers in . An unsupervised algorithm for detecting abnormal electricity consumption patterns
is proposed. They use monthly average load data as the
dataset and obtain trend index, variability index, and volatility index as feature sets. Then, PCA is used in FE of the
feature sets to two dimensions, and the local outlier factor
is calculated to ﬁnd anomalous power consumption patterns.
Sun et al. proposed an improved outlier detection method
based on the Gauss kernel function. After consumers are
classiﬁed by clustering, the feature set of the electricity consumption behavior of each type of consumer is constructed,
such as trend indicators, the standard deviation of daily load
series. Then, the feature set is reduced to 2 dimensions
by PCA, and the improved Gaussian kernel function detects
the outliers. This method is similar to in its feature
strategy. An optimum-path forest (OPF) clustering algorithm
is proposed in . They take the problem of NTL recognition as an anomaly detection task to analyze and use eight
features to represent each electricity customer for clustering
As mentioned above, several of features constructed are
subjective and cannot reﬂect the inherent electricity consumption behavior of customers. Additionally, the features
extracted lack of interpretability.

C. FEATURES OBTAINED BY DEEP LEARNING
ALGORITHMS
Zhang et al. used a deep belief network based on
real-valued (RDBN) to detect electricity theft. The electricity
consumption data are divided into a training set and a test
set, and dimension reduction is performed by factor analysis.
The RDBN is built and trained to obtain electricity consumption behavior features and to realize anomaly detection.
Yu et al. introduced a feature extraction method based on
deep learning theory to detect electricity theft. The stacking
uncorrelation autoencoder (SUAE) is proposed and used to
extract features from electricity consumption data. It can
extract highly abstract and concise features due to its deep
structure and high nonlinearity. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning method is proposed in 
and used to extract features from massive load proﬁles
automatically.
The features generated by deep learning algorithms lack
interpretability and rely on data with labels. At the same time,
it makes model building and parameter selection challenging.
D. FEATURE ENGINEERING TO OBTAIN THE OPTIMAL
FEATURE SET
R. Razavi et al. introduced the concept of feature engineering
into anomaly detection applications for the ﬁrst time .
The feature engineering framework proposed was used to
create a set of features that could best express the dynamics
of a load over time. It was easier to detect abnormalities
and fraud behaviors of anomalous households in comparison
with similar households. In , Lu Jun et al. proposed a
strategy based on feature information quantity to select the
optimized feature set of customers’ electricity consumption
behavior. According to the mutual information (MI) and the
correlation coefﬁcient between features, the optimal feature
subset was selected based on the common feature set. Aydin
and Gungor and Toma and Li presented two feature
construction techniques for NTL characterization. Compared
with algorithm improvement, they were more concerned
about ﬁnding the set of features that best discriminate legal
and illegal proﬁles.
In summary, the problem of how to acquire the optimal
feature set, which can reﬂect users’ electricity consumption
behavior, is becoming a research hotspot. A series of methods
(i.e., feature strategies) of feature engineering in machine
learning have gradually become more prevalent in abnormal
electricity consumption behavior detection.
III. METHODOLOGY
The abnormal detection method of electrical consumption
behavior is proposed ﬁrstly in this section, and the conducted
of the research is also discussed. After that, the details of the
method are discussed in the rest of this section.
A. PROCESS OF THE METHOD
Based on the related concepts of unsupervised learning, feature engineering and the general process of data mining,
the abnormal detection method of electricity consumption
FIGURE 2. The unsupervised method of anomaly detection for electricity
consumption based on feature engineering.
behavior is proposed, and it is shown in Fig. 2. The method
includes three parts: data preparation, feature engineering,
and anomaly detection.
In the process of dataset preparation, different methods are
selected to address speciﬁc problems in the dataset. Feature
engineering includes the original feature set construction of
electricity consumption behavior, FS based on variance, and
FS based on improved maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR). The problem of missing crucial features
missing, caused by subjective selection, can be avoided by
using the brainstorming method in building the original feature set of electricity consumption behavior. The maximum
information coefﬁcient (MIC) is used to replace the MI to
measure the correlation and redundancy between features
based on the supervised FS algorithm of mRMR. Compared
with MI, MIC has the advantages of generality and equitability. In addition, the concept of relevance in mRMR is rede-
ﬁned to apply in unsupervised cases. In the anomaly detection
step, a density-based clustering algorithm is adopted, and the
best clustering parameters are obtained by iteration based on
a certain clustering evaluation standard. Finally, customers’
abnormal electricity consumption behavior is detected; the
load data of an industrial park are selected for experimental
B. FC BASED ON TSFRESH
To overcome the problems in the FC process mentioned
earlier, a Python package named tsfresh (time series feature
extraction based on scalable hypothesis tests) was used to
construct the original feature set from the load data set. tsfresh
is a Python-based development package that can quickly calculate a large number of time series characteristics, namely,
VOLUME 8, 2020
W. Zhang et al.: Unsupervised Detection of Abnormal Electricity Consumption Behavior Based on Feature Engineering
features , . The features calculated by tsfresh can be
used in subsequent research, e.g., classiﬁcation, regression,
and clustering. At present, tsfresh provides 63 time-series feature methods, and 794 time-series features can be calculated
by changing the methods’ parameters .
Customers’ load data are essentially a time series , .
Many aspects of the information on electricity consumption
behavior can be obtained by constructing the original feature
set based on tsfresh. Problems such as missing vital features
due to insufﬁcient consideration can be avoided. At present,
tsfresh can extract 794 features from the customers’ daily load
data, including the commonly used electricity consumption
features in the existing research. However, when constructing
the feature set through tsfresh, the correlation between the
features and the labels cannot be considered because of the
lack of label information. Unavoidably, there are a large number of redundant features in the original electricity consumption behavior feature set (referred to as the original feature
set). The dimension of the original feature set is higher due to
the existence of a large number of redundant features, which
reduces the efﬁciency of the algorithm and leads to the ‘‘curse
of dimensionality’’ , , . Therefore, to ensure the
interpretability of features, it is necessary to carry out the
FS process for the original electricity consumption feature
C. FS BASED ON VARIANCE
FS based on variance, which belongs to the ﬁltering method
in FS, looks only at the features, not the desired outputs,
and can thus be used for unsupervised learning. After the
variance of features is calculated, the variance of a feature
being minimal means that the feature has a low difference
in the sample set and a weak ability to distinguish samples.
In contrast, if the variance of a feature is maximal, the feature
has a higher impact on the overall sample set, including more
information that can reﬂect the differences between samples.
For the feature matrix F with d samples and n features
The equation of the ith feature variance is
where µj is the average value of the j-th feature, and the
equation is as follows:
To improve the efﬁciency of the method and reduce information loss, it is necessary to reduce the number of features
in the original feature set to a reasonable number. Therefore,
the variance of each feature in the original feature set is
calculated ﬁrst. After that, only features with variance equal
to zero are removed, and the features with nonzero variance
are retained.
D. MAXIMUM INFORMATION COEFFICIENT
The relationship coefﬁcient is usually used to measure the
similarity between features. In statistics, the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient and Spearman correlation coefﬁcient are
the most well-known measures to calculate the correlation
between feature vectors. However, the scope of its application
is limited because only linear and simple nonlinear associations can be identiﬁed. The correlation between most features
is complex and nonlinear, and the traditional correlation measurement method cannot reﬂect sophisticated associations.
The MIC proposed by Reshef et al. based on MI can
not only ﬁnd linear or nonlinear correlations but can also
widely mine the nonfunctional dependence between vectors.
It has been proven that in many cases, the MIC has a better
performance than MI. The MIC has been applied in the power
industry. For example, in , K. Zheng et al. used the MIC
to ﬁnd the correlations between the NTL and tampered load
proﬁles of consumers to ﬁnd abnormal users. The scale of the
MIC is , and a larger value indicates a stronger correlation between two feature vectors. The MIC has the characteristics of generation, equitability, and symmetry. Generation
means that when the sample size is sufﬁcient, the MIC can
capture a wide range of interesting associations that are not
limited to speciﬁc function types. Equitability means that the
MIC can give similar scores to different types of correlation
with equal noise levels. The deﬁnition of symmetry is as
MIC (a;b) = MIC (b;a)
where a and b are two vectors. Given a ﬁnite set D,
the elements of which are data points with two dimensions
of x-values and y-values. An x −by−y grid G can be created
in ﬁnite two-dimensional space based on the supposition that
the x-values of D can be partitioned into x bins, and the
y-values of D can be partitioned into y bins. Let all elements in
D be arranged in the grid G. Let D|G represent the distribution
of D divided by one of x −by −y grids as G. Calculate the
MI under each grid division as follows:
I∗(D, x, y) = max
denotes the MI of D|G, D ∈R2, and x, y ∈N∗.
Because the division of grid G is inﬁnite, the number I
is also inﬁnite, and the largest representation is I∗(D, x, y).
The characteristic matrix M is composed of the maximum
normalized MI obtained under different grid divisions, which
is deﬁned as follows:
M (D)x,y =
I∗(D, x, y)
log min {x, y}
where the log min {x, y} is the maximal possible MI of a
distribution on an x −by −y grid . Normalizing by the
log min {x, y} creates a score that can be compared across
VOLUME 8, 2020
W. Zhang et al.: Unsupervised Detection of Abnormal Electricity Consumption Behavior Based on Feature Engineering
grids with different dimensions and therefore across different
distributions. It also ensures that almost all noiseless functions receive perfect scores and the entries of the characteristic matrix M range from zero to one . Furthermore,
the MIC of a ﬁnite set D of two-variable data with sample
size n is given by
MIC (D) = max
where B (n) is the upper bound of the grid size. This paper
uses B (n)
n0.6 because it has better performance in
practice , , , .
E. FS BASED ON IMPROVED mRMR
This section proposes an improved algorithm based on the
supervised FS algorithm mRMR , which can be used
in the unsupervised case. The algorithm selects the MIC to
replace the MI as the feature coefﬁcient evaluation metric
and deﬁnes relevance in FS without label information. The
mRMR maximizes the relevance between features and category variables, i.e., class labels, and minimizes the redundancy between features in the constructed feature subset. The
m-th feature vector is selected based on mRMR from the
original feature set F and represented by f gm as follows:
f iϵF−Sm−1
where S represents the selected feature subset, I (·) denotes
the MI between a pair of vectors, and c is the class label
variable. Due to the difﬁculty in obtaining the class label c,
the unsupervised FS is based on the mRMR algorithm proposed, which should meet the following requirements:
1. The m-th feature selected should contain the largest
amount of information, i.e., this feature can minimize the
uncertainty of other features;
2. In the optimal feature subset S, the relevance between
features should be as small as possible, which will minimize
the redundancy between the selected features.
The unsupervised FS algorithm starts from an empty set
and uses a step-by-step method to select a feature from the
original feature set F and add it to the feature subset S. The
ﬁrst feature selected f g1, which has the maximum average
MIC value, found by calculating the MIC between features
in the original feature set F, is deﬁned as follows:
f g1 = max
where n = |F| represents the number of features in F.
The ﬁrst feature has the highest relevance to the remaining
features, which can reduce the uncertainty of other features
to the greatest extent and provide the most information compared with the others. Therefore, the relevance of a feature is
deﬁned as the average value of the MIC between the feature
and the other features in the set.
The m-th feature selected mainly considers the following
two aspects: containing the largest amount of information
with other features in the set F and having the smallest degree
of redundancy with other features in the subset S. By using the
incremental search, the search for the m-th feature is written
as an optimization problem as follows:
f iϵF−Sm−1
MIC(f i; f t)
where m −1 represents the number of features in feature
subset S before feature selection. To make the algorithm
take both efﬁciency and effect into account, the termination
condition of FS is deﬁned as follows:
 f gm; f j
For the selected m-th feature, when the amount of information it contains has less redundancy than a certain threshold, the selection is stopped. The ﬂow of the unsupervised
in Algorithm 1.
FS is usually in an independent part of the data mining
process, which cannot beneﬁt from the previous data exploration process. Information loss is inevitable with the feature
dimension reduction in the FS process, but it can reduce the
computational complexity of the process.
F. CLUSTERING ALGORITHM
Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise
(DBSCAN) is a classical clustering algorithm based on density that is widely used in anomaly detection . Compared with k-mean and partition-based clustering algorithms,
DBSCAN can ﬁnd any shape of clustering without setting the
number of clusters in advance, and it is not sensitive to the
order of data points. At the same time, it can detect outliers
in the process of clustering.
Given a set of points in a certain space, DBSCAN can
divide the points in the high-density area into a group
and mark the outliers in the low-density area, i.e., outliers. DBSCAN needs to set the following two neighborhood
parameters: the ε-neighborhood and the minimum number of
points (represented by MinPts) needed to form a high-density
area. The ε-neighborhood describes the neighborhood distance threshold of a sample, and MinPts describes the
threshold of the number of samples in the ε-neighborhood.
In short, the basic idea of the algorithm is to explore the
ε-neighborhood of any point that is not visited. If the number of points in the ε-neighborhood reaches MinPts, a new
cluster is established. Otherwise, the point is labeled as an

G. EVALUATION INDEX
The unsupervised evaluation indexes are selected to evaluate
clustering performance, e.g., the silhouette coefﬁcient (SC),
the Calinski Harabasz index (CHI), and the Davies-Bouldin
index (DBI). The higher the scores of SC and CHI, the lower
the scores of DBI, indicating that the clustering algorithm
has better-deﬁned clusters and better separation between the
clusters. The scores of indexes under different clustering
parameters are obtained by iteration. The ranking sum of the
three index scores under different clustering parameters is
used to evaluate clustering to avoid the problem of different
index magnitudes. The clustering evaluation scores (CES) are
deﬁned as follows:
CES = rankSC + rankSHI −rankDBI
The clustering parameters with the highest CES will be used
for clustering and obtain the ﬁnal anomaly detection results.
In order to realize methods evaluation and comparison, the confusion matrix and several derived indexes are
used. The confusion matrix is shown in Table 1. FN refers
to the actual abnormal electricity consumption behavior that
is detected as normal electricity consumption behavior, and
FP refers to the actual normal electricity consumption
TABLE 1. Confusion matrix for abnormal electricity consumption
behavior detection.
behavior that is detected as abnormal. TP and TN indicate correct detection, i.e., the actual abnormal behavior
is detected as abnormal, and the actual normal behavior
is detected as normal. Several evaluation criteria can be
derived from the confusion matrix and used to evaluate
the results of different feature strategies methods. The true
positive rate (TPR), also known as the sensitivity or recall,
is deﬁned as the proportion of detecting as abnormal in
actual abnormal electricity consumption behavior. The false
positive rate (FPR) is deﬁned as the proportion of detecting as abnormal in actual normal electricity consumption
behavior. The positive predictive values (PPV) also known as
the precision is deﬁned as the proportion of actual abnormal
electricity consumption behavior in detected as abnormal
electricity consumption. TPR, FPR, and PPV are deﬁned as
TP + FN×100%
FP + TN × 100%
TP + FP × 100%
In many cases, there is an imbalance between positive and
negative samples in the data set, and TPR (i.e. recall) and
PPV (i.e. precision) are contradictory in most cases. If the
method wants to detect more abnormal electricity consumption behavior, it will be possible to detect more normal.
Therefore, there will be higher TPR and lower PVV. On the
contrary, if the method is relatively conservative, only certain
samples are detected. The method will have a higher PVV and
a lower TPR. Therefore, the F1 Score (also called balanced
F score) and FPR are selected as the evaluation criteria of the
method in this paper. The F1 Score is deﬁned as the harmonic
mean of TPR and PPV, which can be used to evaluate the
performance of unbalanced label data set. The F1 Score is
deﬁned as follows:
F1 = 2 × PPV × TPR
F1 Score helps to compute TPR and PPV in one equation so
that the problem to distinguish the models with low TPR and
high PVV or vice versa could be solved.
IV. EXPERIMENT
The load dataset of an industrial park is used for analysis in
this paper. First, inherent electricity consumption habits and
abnormal electricity consumption behavior of different users
are detected through the method proposed. Then, to evaluate the method, six methods given in Appendix A are used

to inject abnormal electricity consumption data. After that,
the label information database is established by combining the original abnormal electricity consumption behavior
and the abnormal data injection information. Finally, with the
label information database, the feature engineering method
proposed and several common feature strategies are used for
comparison and evaluation. The experiment shows that the
method based on the feature engineering proposed is better
than the others by comparing the clustering evaluation results.
The ﬂow chart of the experimental stage is shown in Fig. 3.
A. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
All experiments are implemented on a single computer with
a CPU of 2.6 GHz and a memory of 16 GB. Experiments and
results are completed with the jupyter notebook compiling
environment with Python version 3.6 and the relevant Python
B. DATA PREPARATION
The basic information about the data set is shown in Table 2;
it includes 15 industrial and commercial electricity users, and
the data were collected over a period of 547 days with a
sampling interval of 1 hour. The anomaly detection work in
this paper is accurate to the unit of days. Four typical users
are selected from the data set for analysis, numbered User1 to
TABLE 3. Main problems in the data cleaning process.
Data cleaning plays a vital role because the data set is of
raw data that has not been processed. The main problems
found in the process of data cleaning are shown in Table 3.
C. FEATURE ENGINEERING FOR USERS’ ELECTRICITY
CONSUMPTION BEHAVIOR
The tsfresh package is used to construct the original feature
set in days. Seven hundred ninety-four electricity consumption behavior features are extracted for each customer, and
the feature matrix of size 547∗794 is generated. The original
feature set of electricity consumption behavior on the ith day
is expressed as follows:
1, · · ·f i
j , · · · f i
The Gauss kernel function is used to estimate the variance
distribution of the 794 column features, as shown in Fig. 4.
According to Fig. 4, the logarithms of the feature variance in
different customers’ original feature sets have a similar distribution, which is mostly concentrated between [−20,20], and
most values are equal to 0. Although the FS based on variance
has dramatically reduced the dimension of the original feature
set, there is still much redundant information between the
features. Therefore, FS based on improved mRMR is needed.
The MIC between feature sets is calculated after FS based
on variance is performed, and the time complexity is O
Therefore, only the upper triangle (or lower triangle) matrix
of the MIC matrix is calculated to reduce calculation time
based on the symmetry of MIC in (6). The MIC matrix is
obtained, as shown in Fig. 5, where the parameters for the
MIC are selected according to .
Different colors in Fig. 5 correspond to different values
of the MIC. When there is no correlation between the two
features, the MIC is 0, which is shown in red. When there is
a certain correlation relationship between features, the MIC
is 1, which is shown in blue. From the color density and the
sum of all elements in the customers’ MIC matrix, it can be
seen that there are apparent differences in the feature sets
between customers. The MIC of the User2 feature set is
the smallest, and the proportion of red is the highest, which
means that the correlation between features is the lowest.
In contrast, the MIC of the User4 feature set is the largest,
and the proportion of blue is the highest, which means that
the correlation between features is the highest.
The FS based on mRMR is conducted based on the
MIC matrix. A smaller number of features will result in
missing crucial information; on the contrary, a large number of features will increase the running time and cause

dimension disaster. Therefore, setting a reasonable value
of the termination parameter T in (13) is very important.
After many experiments and analyses, when T
the proposed method can meet the requirements of accuracy and generalizability. That is, when the correlation of
the m-th feature is less than its redundancy, the FS is
From Table 4 and Fig. 5, User2, with the lowest sum
of the MIC matrix, has the highest number of features
after FS. In contrast, User4, with the highest sum of the
MIC matrix, has the lowest number of features ultimately
obtained. Therefore, the conclusion is that more features
are needed to reﬂect customers’ electricity behavior when
the correlation between features in the electricity behavior
feature set is lower. A smaller number of features are needed
when the correlation between features is higher. The violin plots of the features in the optimal feature set of customer electricity consumption behaviors are shown. Those of
User1 and User4 are shown in Fig. 6, and those of User2 and
User3 are shown in Appendix B.

FIGURE 6. The violin plot of the features in the optimal feature sets of user1 and user4.
TABLE 4. Change in users’ feature numbers in the process of feature
engineering.
A violin plot plays a similar role as a box-and-whisker plot,
which is used to visualize the distribution of the data and
its probability density. A violin plot shows the distribution
of quantitative data across several levels of more categorical
variables so that those distributions can be compared .
The violin plot shows a kernel density estimation of the
underlying distribution rather than actual data points. The
violin plot in Fig. 6 indicates that the distributions of features
in the optimal sets of electricity consumption features of
different users are quite different. Each ‘‘violin’’ in Fig.6 and
Appendix B. represents a feature in the optimal feature set of a
user. The shape represents the density estimate of the feature,
i.e. the more data points in a speciﬁc range, the larger the
violin is for that range. Different colors are used to distinguish
different features in a user’s optimal feature set.
The violin plot in Fig. 6 and Appendix B is a combination
of a box plot and a density plot that is rotated and placed
on each side, to show the distribution shape of each feature.
The white dot in the middle is the median value and the thick
black bar in the center represents the interquartile range. The
whiskers show a 95% conﬁdence interval and the shape of the
violin display frequencies of values. The features of Users 1
to 3 have a scattered density distribution, which indicates
an excellent ability to distinguish the different electricity
consumption behaviors. It means that the user’s electricity
consumption behavior can be well described by the features
in the optimal feature set obtained by the feature engineering
in this paper. That is, if the features extracted by a user have
a similar distribution, i.e., they have a similar median and
frequency, the different electricity consumption behaviors of
the user cannot be reﬂected from the features. It shows that
this feature set cannot effectively distinguish the abnormal
electricity consumption behaviors from the normal. On the
contrary, if the distribution of multiple features of the user is
quite different, the extracted features can effectively describe
the user’s electricity consumption behavior, then it can deeply
mine the user’s electricity consumption law and realize abnormal detection. However, the violin plot of User4 is different
from that of other users because of the characteristics of
the load curve itself, and the details will be explained later.
The results show the effectiveness of the feature engineering
strategy proposed.
The optimal feature subset, which reﬂects the electricity consumption behavior of different users, is obtained
through the feature engineering strategy proposed. Moreover,
the features in the optimal feature subsets of users are different because users have different electricity consumption
behaviors.

features. The standardization method is as follows:
j is the j-th feature on the i-th day, σ i and µi are the
standard deviation and mean value of the feature vector of the
Through the iterative clustering algorithm parameters,
multiple clustering results are obtained based on the CES, and
the optimal clustering parameters are selected for different
customers as shown in Table 5.
Fig. 7 shows the ﬁnal clustering results reﬂected in the
calendar chart. Colors represent different clustering results,
i.e., different electricity consumption behaviors. The dates
of detected abnormal electricity consumption behaviors are
uniﬁed and marked in black with the category mark −1.
The peach color is used to represent the most common
kind of electricity consumption behavior of users, which has
the category mark 0. The sky blue shown for User1 has
category mark 0, and the orange and red for User4 have
category marks of 1 and 2, respectively, representing other
electricity consumption behaviors of the users. In addition,
data loss is represented with a blank mark. As shown in
Fig. 7, users have habitual electricity consumption behaviors. User1’s electricity consumption behavior on Sundays
is grouped into one group. Most of the abnormal electricity
consumption behavior of User2 occurs at the beginning and
the end of the month. User4’s electricity use behaviors are
grouped into three groups. During the holidays, User1, User2,
and User3 all have abnormal electricity consumption behavior. For visual display, the clustering results are reﬂected in
the original load curve, as shown in Appendix C.
Using the best clustering parameters, shown in Table 5, the
normalized sum of the three indexes in CES are adopted to
evaluate whether the termination parameter T is reasonable.
The variable T directly affects the number of features in the
optimal feature subset for clustering. With a change in the
feature number for clustering, i.e., the variable T, the clustering result changes accordingly, and the results are shown
in Fig. 8. In order to compare different users horizontally,
the sum of three indexes in CES under different feature numbers are normalized and represented as the cluster evaluation,
which is deﬁned as follow:
CESi −min (CES)
max (CES) −min (CES)
where CES∗represents the cluster evaluation in Fig. 8, CESi
represents the CES under the number of features i. The normalized cluster evaluation changes as the number of features
used for clustering increases from 1 to 100 in Fig. 8. When
T = 1, the number of features used for clustering by different

users is shown in Table 4. Under the number of optimal
feature subsets, the cluster evaluations of different users are
all at a high level, which ensures that the algorithm has
generalizability.
As shown in Fig. 8, when the number of features is in a
small range (this means that the variable T is in a high range.),
the clustering evaluations of Users 1 to 4 are all at a high
level, such as User 1, User 3, and User 4 when the number of
features ranging from 1 to 5, and User 2 when the number
of features ranging from 5 to 10. Although it has a good
cluster evaluation when there are few features, it is difﬁcult
to obtain an accurate value of T due to the higher cluster
evaluations only exist in a small range of changes in the
number of features. According to Fig. 8, when the number of
features used for clustering analysis reaches a speciﬁc critical
value, the cluster evaluations drop sharply due to dimension
disaster, such as User1 when the number of features is 20 to
25, User2 when the number of features ranging from 70 to 80,
User3 when the number of features ranging from 35 to 40, and
User4 when the number of features ranging from 85 to 90.
Considering the generalizability and robustness of the
method, the stage of feature number range where the cluster
evaluation changes relatively smoothly and having a higher
level is chosen. Therefore, it is reasonable to choose the
termination parameter T in (13) as 1.
E. COMPARISON AND EVALUATION
For each user, 10% of the load data in units of days are
randomly selected and changed by the six abnormal data
injection (ADI) methods in Appendix A, which are represented as ADI1 to ADI6. Meanwhile, the dates of ADI are
recorded, and the label information database is established
by factoring in the original abnormal electricity consumption
behavior dates. It is worth noting that the label of abnormal
electricity consumption behaviors is only used for evaluation,
and the label information is not included in the detection
Two feature strategies, FE and FC, which are relied on
experience and selected as contrasts to the feature engineering
method given in this paper. In FE, three feature extraction
methods, PCA, restricted boltzmann machine (RBM) and
deep belief network (DBN), are used for comparison. The
PCA selects the parameters as 2 and 3, i.e., the original load
data in days will be reduced to 2 and 3 dimensions after
normalization, and the results are represented by PCA_2d and
PCA_3d. The RBM is a generative stochastic artiﬁcial neural network that can learn a probability distribution through
input data sets. The standard RBM consists of binary hidden
layer and visible layer without connections between the units
within the same layer. RBM can extract discriminative features from complex data set by the unsupervised way due to
the introduction of hidden units . The DBN is a kind of
probability generating model including multiple hidden layers, which can be regarded as a composite model composed
of multiple simple unsupervised learning models , .
The high ﬂexibility of DBN makes it possible to learn discriminant features from the high-dimensional complex data
set. RBM and DBN are all belonged to deep learning and
can be used in unsupervised learning. They can reduce the
dimension of the original data and achieve feature extraction. The RBN and DBN structures in this paper are shown
in Appendix D.
In FC, the common features are constructed by experience
and are represented by CFC (common feature construction).
The features in CFC are commonly used in current research to
reﬂect electricity consumption behaviors. A total of ten features are included in CFC, including maximum and minimum
values of the daily load, the daily peak-valley difference of
the load, the difference of load variation, the daily average
power consumption, the linear degree of the load curve, and
the degree of load deviation. All of these can be obtained
from the original feature set generated by tsfresh. The MI is
also used in the process of FS based on improved mRMR
to prove that the MIC has better performance than the MI.
The F1 Score and FPR are selected as indicators to verify
the detection ability of several feature strategies for six kinds
Fig. 9 consists of six columns, each of which represents an ADI method and includes two subplots, one for
F1 Score and the other for FPR, under different feature
strategies. F1 Score and FPR of different users under different ADI are displayed in the form of histogram. Different
colors are used to distinguish the results of different feature
strategies.
Furthermore, the experimental results were analyzed as
follows. For the feature strategy of PCA, the difference of
the parameters (referring to the ﬁnal feature dimension) has a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the result evaluation indexes F1 Score
and FPR. The experimental results show the process of FE
by PCA. When the parameter of PCA is selected as 3,
the evaluation results are better than they are when the parameter is selected as 2, in most cases. Reducing to 2 dimensions
means losing more information on the original load data than
reducing to 3 dimensions, which leads to the loss of more
crucial information that can distinguish abnormal electricity
consumption behavior. Therefore, the follow-up clustering is
affected, leading to the above results. Note that although the
VOLUME 8, 2020

FIGURE 9. Values of F1 score and FPR for each user under ADI1 to ADI6.
FIGURE 10. The original load curve of user4.
FPR of the PCA method is at a low level in all cases, the level
of the F1 Score is also low, and so it cannot detect anomalies
effectively.
In most cases, it is found that in the results of CFC, all
samples are easily clustered into one group because of the
lack of differences in features. This means that CFC has a
lower F1 Score and a low-level FPR in the same case. CFC
performs well only in a few cases, such as User 3 under ADI1,
User 4 under ADI3, etc. The reason is that the consumption
behaviors of the users and the results of performing ADI
on the load curve do not perfectly correlate. Because CFC
uses only experience and professional knowledge to build the
feature set, it is unable to fully reﬂect the different electricity consumption behaviors of users. Therefore, CFC is only
applicable to speciﬁc users or under speciﬁc ADI method and
has limited generalizability.
The experimental results in Fig. 9 show that DBN has
a higher F1 score and better performance than RBM in
all cases. The reason is that compared with the RBM
two-layer network, DBN deep-layer neural network structure
can extract more abstract and concise electricity consumption
behavior features of users. Even in some cases, for example,
User2 under ADI4 and User1 under ADI6 are better than the
feature engineering method proposed in this paper. However,
the structure and parameter selection of RBM, DBN and
other networks depend on experience and data itself to a
great extent and need to adjust parameters many times for
experiments. Different data sets often correspond to different
neural network structures. Moreover, in the process of RBM
and DBN network training, the acquired features are usually
not interpretable.
Experimental results show that compared with MI, using
the MIC to evaluate the degree of correlation between features
can better mine the correlations between features. In most
cases, the experimental results show that the F1 Score with
MIC is higher than with MI and in a few cases, they have
similar performance, such as those of User1 under ADI2,
ADI3, AID4 and ADI6, User2 under ADI3 and ADI4, and
User4 under ADI4 and ADI5. Although MI and MIC have
similar F1 Score results sometimes, MI has the worst FPR
result in most cases.
In some ADI modes, such as ADI1-ADI5, the F1 Score
of User4 is lower than that of other users. As shown in
Fig. 10, through the analysis of the original load curve, it is
found that User4 has a large number of cases with a daily
load of 0. The unusual characteristics of User4 also lead to
the difference in the violin plot mentioned above. The ADI
process has little impact on the original load data of User4,
VOLUME 8, 2020
W. Zhang et al.: Unsupervised Detection of Abnormal Electricity Consumption Behavior Based on Feature Engineering
so not all kinds of feature engineering strategies can detect
the abnormal behavior well.
The results show that the detection of abnormal behaviors based on the feature engineering proposed can identify
abnormal electricity consumption behavior well compared
with detection based on other feature strategies. The proposed
method has a high F1 score under different ADI methods
and good generalizability for users with different electricity
consumption behaviors. In a few cases, such as User2 under
ADI4, User3 under ADI5, User1 under ADI6, the method
proposed does not perform well compared with other feature
strategies. The reason is that there are similarities between
different users’ inherent electricity consumption behavior
load curve and the load curve injected by abnormal data,
which makes the optimal feature set obtained by the proposed method unable to distinguish the abnormal electricity
consumption behavior and normal effectively. The original
feature set obtained by the proposed method is based on
tsfresh, which is directly obtained from the user’s electricity
load curve. Other feature strategies, such as PCA and DBN,
do not rely on the load data curve directly but acquire features
through dimension reduction and training the neural network.
Therefore, those feature strategies will not be affected by
the above reason and have good performance compared with
the proposed method in a few cases. However, the above
phenomenon belongs to the existence of a speciﬁc situation.
In practice, the abnormal electricity consumption behavior of
users is generally different from their inherent electricity use
habits. In addition, the better performance of other feature
strategies also depends on the parameters detected through
repeated experiments, but the selection of parameters largely
depends on the data itself and experience. Although in a
few cases the proposed method is inferior to other feature
strategies, on the whole, it can effectively detect the abnormal electricity consumption behavior of most users under
different ADI methods and can meet the requirements of
unsupervised detection.
In order to ensure that the method proposed can detect
all abnormal electricity consumption behaviors of users to
the maximum extent, it is inevitable that a small number
of normal electricity consumption behavior data are judged
as abnormal data by the method in the clustering process.
As a result, the proposed method has a higher FPR compared with other feature strategies in these cases, which
are those of User1 under ADI3, User3 under ADI4, and
User2 under ADI5 and ADI6. In some cases, the higher FPR
is also affected by the user’s own electricity consumption
behavior. That is, if the user’s minority normal electricity
behavior and the abnormal electricity usage behavior are
similar in some aspects, there is a possibility of misjudgment
as abnormal electricity consumption. Because the proposed
method detects abnormal electricity consumption behavior
of users as much as possible, there are inevitably a few
cases with high FPR. However, considering the generalization of the method and avoiding experience inﬂuence, in most
cases, the proposed method can ensure that it has a higher
TABLE 6. Six kinds of abnormal data injection methods.
FIGURE 11. An instance of abnormal data injection for Table 6.
F1 Score and lower FPR, which can meet the requirements of
unsupervised anomaly detection.
At the same time, some cluster algorithms, such as k-means
and fuzzy c-means are used to compare with the DBSACN
clustering algorithm. The above clustering algorithms need
to set the number of clusters and other parameters, but in
practice, it is difﬁcult to know the user’s inherent electricity
consumption behaviors in advance. Although the user’s electricity consumption data can be divided into several clusters,
it is not advisable to only rely on subjective experience to
regard a certain cluster as abnormal electricity consumption
behavior. Therefore, the above clustering algorithm is not
suitable for unsupervised anomaly detection. However, in the
case of supervision, the user’s inherent electricity consumption behavior can be divided into several categories based
on the user’s various information, so the above clustering
algorithm will have a good performance. DBSCAN clustering algorithm, as mentioned above, can detect outliers in
the process of clustering without determining the number of
clusters in advance, and it is not sensitive to the order of
data points, so it is more suitable for unsupervised anomaly
detection.

behavior, an unsupervised abnormal detection method based
on feature engineering is proposed. The proposed method
is based on unsupervised learning with feature engineering
as the core, combined with a density clustering algorithm
to detect abnormal electricity consumption behavior. In the
proposed method, the feature engineering part does not rely
on experience, and can comprehensively and objectively
obtain the optimal feature subset reﬂecting the user’s electricity consumption behavior, and the obtained features are
interpretable. The abnormal detection part can avoid subjectivity through parameter iteration and clustering evaluation.
In addition, the proposed method does not depend on the
data and labels information, which has better generalization
and practicability. At the same time, the proposed method
involves customer portrait analysis, which can fully mine the
intrinsic value of electricity consumption data.
Although the result of the anomaly detection method based
on feature engineering is satisfactory, there is still room for
improvement in terms of clustering algorithms based on density. In addition, because this paper studies small-scale data
sets, in future works, when faced with the massive amount of
data of the power grid, the problem of how to detect massive
users in parallel still needs further research. At the same
time, expansion of the application scenarios of the proposed
method to cases such as demand-side response and power
fault detection remains to be considered.
