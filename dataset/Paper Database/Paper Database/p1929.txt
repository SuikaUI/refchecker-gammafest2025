We review recent results for the properties of doped antiferromagnets, obtained by the numerical analysis of the planar t-J model using the novel ﬁnite-temperature Lanczos method for
small correlated systems. First we shortly summarize our present understanding of anomalous
normal-state properties of cuprates, and present the electronic phase diagram, phenomenological scenarios and models proposed in this connection. The numerical method is then described
in more detail. Following sections are devoted to various static and dynamical properties of the
t-J model. Among thermodynamic properties the chemical potential, entropy and the speciﬁc
heat are evaluated. Discussing electrical properties the emphasis is on the optical conductivity
and the d.c. resistivity. Magnetic properties involve the static and dynamical spin structure
factor, as measured via the susceptibility measurements, the NMR relaxation and the neutron
scattering, as well as the orbital current contribution. Follows the analysis of electron spectral
functions, being studied in photoemission experiments. Finally we discuss density ﬂuctuations,
the electronic Raman scattering and the thermoelectric power. Whenever feasible a comparison
with experimental data is performed. A general conclusion is that the t-J model captures well
the main features of anomalous normal-state properties of cuprates, for a number of quantities
the agreement is even a quantitative one. It is shown that several dynamical quantities exhibit
at intermediate doping a novel universal behaviour consistent with a marginal Fermi-liquid concept, which seems to emerge from a large degeneracy of states and a frustration induced by
doping the antiferromagnet.

Introduction
The discovery of the high-temperature superconductivity (SC) in copper-oxide based compounds cuprates revived the interest in materials containing transition elements.
The main feature of these materials is the crucial role of electron-electron interactions. This can
result in electronic properties, very unusual when compared to the behaviour of conventional metals.
Although the unconventional SC is clearly the most puzzling phenomenon in cuprates, we focus in
this review predominantly on the analysis of more or less anomalous properties of the normal state
which deviate essentially from the standard understanding of electrons in metals and still present
one of the major theoretical challenges in the solid state physics.
The cuprate superconductors have a very anisotropic structure, where the common building
blocks are layers, in cuprates formed by combining one of the three possible structural elements
containing Cu and O, as shown in Fig. 1.1b. The CuO layered structures are stacked in the crystal,
separated by various intercalant layers in diﬀerent cuprates.
In spite of vast diﬀerences in the
structure of unit cells, electronic properties of the whole family of cuprates are quite universal.
This can be explained by the predominant role of generic CuO2 planes, Fig. 1.1a, where conducting
electrons reside. The electronic coupling between CuO2 planes is very weak, resulting in a huge ratio
of the in-plane resistivity to the perpendicular resistivity, in the anisotropy of the SC coherence
length etc. Intermediate layers serve mainly as a charge reservoir for the planes. Consequently
properties of cuprates are quite well classiﬁed according to the doping level of the reference CuO2
electronic structure.
Figure 1.1: (a) Schematic structure of copper-oxide planes and (b) three possible building blocks
of the planes, after Fulde .
As now well established, the reference cuprate compounds, as La2CuO4 and YBa2Cu3O6, are
Mott (charge-transfer) insulators due to strong correlations which induce in a half-ﬁlled band
a charge gap ∼2 eV. The spin degrees of planar CuO2 electrons can be well mapped on the
properties of a planar antiferromagnetic (AFM) S = 1/2 Heisenberg model. The AFM ground
state of undoped materials, emerging from strong correlations, has been quite early recognized as
a crucial starting point for theoretical considerations of doped materials, being
strange metals in the normal state and exhibiting high transition temperature Tc to the SC state.
There are by now numerous indications that essential features of electronic properties of the
doped AFM, as realized in cuprates, are well represented by prototype single-band models of
correlated electrons, as the Hubbard model and the t-J model .
In spite of their
apparent simplicity both models are notoriously diﬃcult to treat analytically, in particular in
the most interesting regime of strong correlations.
The lack of analytical tools for correlated
electrons has increased the eﬀorts towards numerical
approaches , which predominantly can be divided into two categories: the quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) methods and the exact diagonalization (ED) methods. The t-J model, which
incorporates the strong correlation requirement explicitly, is more adapted to the ED approach.
So far most calculations were performed for the ground state (g.s.) at T = 0, where the standard
Lanczos technique oﬀers an eﬃcient ED analysis of small systems of reasonable
sizes. Recently, present authors introduced a novel numerical method,
combining the Lanczos method with a random sampling, which allows for an analogous treatment of
statics and dynamics of many-body quantum models at T > 0. The latter method, further referred
to as the ﬁnite-temperature Lanczos method (FTLM), and results for the t-J model obtained using
this method, are the main subject of this review.
The ﬁnal goal is to understand properties of doped AFM in general, and of high-Tc cuprates
in particular.
In the absence of reliable analytical methods and results, numerical calculations
can help to answer several crucial questions. Are strong correlations, as incorporated in prototype
models, enough to account for anomalous normal-state properties of the strange metal ? Which
are the relevant energy and temperature scales in doped AFM, as represented by the t-J model,
and in which properties do they show up ? Which is the unifying phenomenological description of
the normal state ? Is the t-J model suﬃcient, or which ingredients should be added to account
qualitatively and quantitatively for observed properties ? Can we learn something macroscopically
meaningful from the studies of small systems, and why ?
We note that at present the SC seems to be beyond the reach of numerical approaches including
the FTLM, hence we do not investigate here in more detail the possible existence of SC and its
origin in model systems.
Cuprates as doped antiferromagnets
Electronic phase diagram and properties of the normal state
Reference cuprate compounds are AFM insulators and are so far best understood. Properties of
various other layered cuprates can be interpreted in terms of doping the reference material, where
(mainly) holes are introduced into CuO2 planes. One of the major conceptual achievements, which
emerged from careful experimental investigations of high-quality materials in the last decade, has
been the realization of quite universal electronic phase diagram , revealing characteristic temperature scales as they develop as the function
of hole doping.
It is at present quite common to classify materials with respect to doping as
underdoped, optimally doped and overdoped, and the corresponding phase diagram is shown in
Optimum doping regime
Experimentally optimum doping is chosen to correspond to materials with the highest Tc within
the given class of chemically and structurely related compounds. It has been realized soon after
the discovery of high-Tc SC that also normal state properties at T > Tc of the optimally doped
materials are very anomalous, but at the same time also most universal. The prominent feature
is the resistivity law ρ ∝T , valid essentially in the whole measurable range
T > Tc and clearly contradicting the normal Landau-Fermi-liquid (LFL) behaviour ρ ∝T 2. Related
is the observation that the dynamical conductivity σ(ω) does not fall oﬀfor larger ω according to
the Drude form σ ∝1/ω2, but rather as σ ∝1/ω .
Figure 2.1:
Schematic electronic phase diagram of cuprates, after Batlogg .
The clearest evidence for an anomalous spin dynamics comes from the NMR and NQR relaxation
 , where the relaxation rate 1/T1 on planar 63Cu in optimally doped La2−xSrxCuO4
(LSCO) with xopt ∼0.15 is nearly T-independent (as well as nearly doping independent) in contrast
to the usual Korringa law for metals 1/T1 ∝T. The qualitative diﬀerence, i.e. a large enhancement
of low-frequency spin ﬂuctuations at low T, can be related to the persistence of short range AFM
ﬂuctuations, even at the optimum doping. The support for this comes also from neutron scattering
experiments, where a substantial AFM correlation length ξ has been measured in the same class of
materials, with ξ ∼3.8A/√x .
On the other hand, several properties at the optimum doping seem to be close to the normal LFL
picture. The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on cuprates , most reliable for BiSrCaCuO (BISCCO) compounds, shows electronic excitations consistent
with a large Fermi surface (FS) and with the conserved FS volume (Luttinger theorem), although
spectral shapes are quite distinct from a simple LFL picture. The speciﬁc heat 
follows in the normal state roughly the LFL behaviour Cv = γT with γ not very far from the
free-fermion value, consistent with a nearly T-independent uniform susceptibility χ0, whereby the
Wilson ratio is close to the free-fermion one . It is also the unifying characteristic
of the optimum doping that properties do not reveal above Tc any additional characteristic T scale.
Overdoped and underdoped regime
In overdoped materials Tc is decreasing and ﬁnally vanishing with increased doping. At the same
time the electronic properties are getting closer to the usual metallic behaviour consistent with the
LFL scenario. E.g., the resistivity behaviour moves towards the normal FLF form ρ ∝T 2 , spectral shapes of electronic excitations, as revealed by ARPES, become sharper near
the FS etc. These facts can be put together with a decreasing intensity
of AFM ﬂuctuations. It is thus plausible that we are dealing in the overdoped regime with the
crossover to the normal LFL, however this crossover is not a trivial one and so far also not well
understood either.
The most evident progress in the investigations of normal-state properties has been made in
last few years for the underdoped cuprates. In contrast to the optimum doping, experiments reveal
in this regime additional characteristic temperatures T > Tc , which show
up as the crossovers where particular properties qualitatively change. As summarized in Fig. 2.1,
there seems to be an indication for two distinct crossovers. The existence of both as well as their
distinction is still widely debated, nevertheless we will refer to them as the AFM crossover scale
T ∗and the pseudogap scale Tsg for the lower one .
The T ∗scale shows up most clearly as the maximum of the spin susceptibility χ0(T = T ∗) . The in-plane resistivity ρ(T) is linear ρ ∝T for T > T ∗
and decreases more steeply for T < T ∗. Characteristic is also the anomalous T-dependence of the
Hall constant RH(T) for T < T ∗ . The latter is evidently hole-like
in the classical sense RH(T ≳Tc) ∝1/x, which is also not properly understood theoretically. It
seems plausible that the T ∗crossover is related to the onset of short-range AFM correlations for
T < T ∗, since in the undoped AFM T ∗corresponds just to a well understood maximum due to a
gradual transition from a disordered paramagnet to the one with short-range AFM correlations.
The crossover Tsg has been ﬁrst identiﬁed in connection with the decrease of the NMR relaxation
1/T1 for T < Tsg , indicating the reduction of low-energy spin
excitations interpreted as the opening of the spin pseudogap in underdoped materials. Most striking
evidence for an additional energy scale in underdoped cuprates is the observation of the leadingedge shift in ARPES measurements at T > Tc , indicating features of the
d-wave SC gap persisting within the normal phase. It should be pointed out, however, that the
designation of crossover features is at present still controversial.
In particular it is not evident
whether we are dealing with two or more essentially diﬀerent energy scales.
Phenomenology of the normal state
Properties of the normal LFL follow from the one-to-one correspondence of low-energy excitations
of the interacting fermion system to that of a free-fermion gas. The prerequisite is that the volume
of the FS is conserved . Essential are the well deﬁned quasiparticles (QP) with
the vanishing damping at the FS, with Γ ∝(E −EF )2. Consequences are the linear speciﬁc heat
CV = γT, nearly T-independent static and dynamical spin susceptibilities, the Korringa law for
NMR relaxation 1/T1 ∝T, the resistivity ρ(T) ∝T 2 etc. Experimental facts on cuprates contradict
the usual LFL picture. Several more or less elaborated scenarios have been proposed to capture
main anomalous features.
Focusing on the importance of AFM spin ﬂuctuations, the concept of a nearly AFM Fermi
liquid (NAFL) has been elaborated . Here one assumes that at
low-frequencies χ′′(⃗q, ω) ∝ω at all ⃗q, as expected in a LFL, but with strongly enhanced ﬂuctuations
near the AFM wavevector ⃗Q = (π, π), corresponding to the critical slowing down in the proximity
of a phase transition to the AFM-ordered state. The following form has been proposed, which can
be derived also via the self-consistent paramagnon theory ,
χ(⃗q, ω) =
1 + ξ2|⃗q −⃗Q|2 −iω/ωSF
In the proposal by Millis et al. , originally devoted to the interpretation of the NMR and
NQR relaxation, the main T-dependence is expected to arise from the AFM correlation length ξ,
which is assumed to show a critical behaviour as T is decreased, i.e. ξ2 ∝Tx/(T + Tx). In order
to explain the anomalous NQR relaxation 1/T1(T) ∼const , contradicting the
Korringa law, strong T-dependence of ξ is essential with Tx ∼100 K, as well as low ωSF and large
χ ⃗Q for T ∼Tc . The form of spin ﬂuctuations is the basis for further
investigations of the charge dynamics, strongly coupled to spin degrees of freedom. The calculated
response functions such as the conductivity appear also anomalous, e.g. the resistivity is close to a
linear law ρ ∝T.
There are several proposals, analogous to the NAFL in the basic idea of the proximity to a critical
point, enhancing ﬂuctuations in the optimum doping regime. One proposal invokes the quantum
critical scaling of the spin dynamics, established in the nonlinear sigma model , induced by doping the AFM . Another scenario relates the quantum
critical point to a charge-density-wave instability .
An alternative interpretation of experimental facts has been provided by the concept of a
marginal Fermi liquid (MFL) . The hypothesis is that there exist excitations,
contributing both to the charge and spin response, which show in a broad range of wavevectors ⃗q
anomalous susceptibilities of the form
χ′′(⃗q, ω) ∼
Due to the scattering on bosonic excitations with the spectrum (2.2) the single-particle self-energy
Σ(⃗k, ω) is also anomalous. Assuming its ⃗k-independence in a broad range, it has been postulated
using phenomenological arguments ,
x = max(|ω|, πT),
where ωc is a high-frequency cutoﬀ.
Hence the QP lifetime 1/τ ∝−Σ′′(ω) is anomalous, i.e.
1/τ(ω) ∝x. It should be however mentioned that the Ansatz (2.3) is not unique and also modiﬁed
forms have been invoked, e.g. in the analysis of the optical conductivity better ﬁt has been obtained with
−Σ′′(ω) ∼πλ(|ω| + πT).
While the FS should remain well deﬁned with the volume equal to that of free fermions, the
corresponding QP weight ˜Z at the FS, given by
˜Z−1 = 1 −∂Σ′(ω)/∂ω|ω=0,
vanishes on the FS in analogy to the case of a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid . The
MFL concept accounts for several remarkable properties at the optimum doping, as the anomalous
resistivity ρ(T) ∝T, the optical conductivity σ(ω) ∝1/ω, the NMR and the NQR relaxation rate
1/T1(T) ∼const. Note that the only low-energy scale within the MFL scenario, equations (2.2) -
(2.4), is given by T. Although there are certain similarities to the NAFL and other critical-point
scenarios, the essential diﬀerence of the MFL concept is a non-critical ⃗q dependence. Hence the
critical behaviour within the MFL is rather a local one. The attempts to derive MFL behaviour
from a microscopic model have not been successful so far.
Models of correlated electrons in cuprates
A similarity of electronic properties in a wide class of diﬀerent cuprates serves as a strong indication
that the appropriate microscopic model should be quite universal and must in ﬁrst place describe
the electrons restricted to CuO2 orbitals within a single plane. There has been quite an extensive
eﬀort put into ﬁnding a proper model, and at present there seems to be a wide consensus on its
main features. This should be contrasted to various other materials with interacting electrons, e.g.
heavy fermions and 1D conductors, where microscopic models are much less known.
Since the physics of electrons in CuO2 planes is governed by Cu 3dx2−y2 orbitals and O 2px,y
orbitals (see the structure in Fig. 1.1), quite a complete model seems to be the three-band Hubbard
model , describing fermion carriers (holes) added to closed 3d10 and 2p6 shells. Parameters are the Cu–O hopping tpd, the direct O–O hopping tpp, the on-site energies εd, εp, and the
corresponding Coulomb repulsions Ud, Up on Cu and O sites, respectively. Parameters correspond
to the charge-transfer regime with ∆= εp −εd > tpd and Ud > ∆. The reference (insulator)
material contains one fermion/cell, entering predominantly the d orbitals. Due to Ud ≫tpd, a large
charge gap ∼2eV opens at half ﬁlling, while spin degrees can be mapped on the isotropic S = 1/2
Heisenberg model, ﬁrst proposed in connection with cuprates by Anderson . Holes added by
doping enter the singlets, introduced by Zhang and Rice , which can be in a fermion model
treated as empty sites (holes). Such a reduction, conﬁrmed also with other analytical approaches
 and cluster methods ,
leads to a single-band t-J model ,
js˜cis + H.c.) + J
(⃗Si · ⃗Sj −1
describing fermions in a tight-binding band with the hopping parameter t ∝t2
pd/∆. Here ⃗Si =
is⃗σss′cis′ are the local spin operators interacting with the exchange parameter J ∝
pd/Ud∆< t. Due to the strong on-site repulsion states with doubly occupied sites are explicitly
forbidden and we are dealing with projected fermion operators ˜cis = cis(1 −ni,−s).
By explicitly projecting out states with doubly occupied sites, the t-J model only allows for
charge ﬂuctuations in terms of a hole motion, while at half-ﬁlling it is equivalent to the S = 1/2
Heisenberg model. The t-J model is expected to capture the essential low-energy physics of doped
AFM as well of cuprates in the whole regime of dopings. The challenging regime of the model is
the one of strong correlations with J < t.
The t-J model is the simplest model which describes the interplay of magnetism and itinerant
metallic properties of cuprates. A more rigorous reduction of the three-band model leads to additional terms, which could be as well represented within a reduced space without doubly occupied sites. Among possible generalizations most
attention has been recently devoted to the addition of the next-nearest-neighbour (n.n.n.) hopping
(t′) terms, emerging from the tpp hopping in the three-band model,
Ht′ = −t′ X
js˜cis + H.c.),
representing the hopping along the diagonal in Fig. 1.1a. Analogous is the t′′ term for the n.n.n.
hopping along each axis. It seems necessary to include such a term to account for the QP dispersion
found in ARPES experiments on undoped material, such as Sr2CuO2Cl2 . In
spite of their apparent smallness, t′ and t′′ terms could lead to relevant corrections since they allow
a free propagation of fermions even in an AFM (N´eel) spin background.
The t-J model, as relevant for cuprates, should be considered on a planar square lattice. Parameters are rather well known . J is measured in the undoped AFM via the inelastic
neutron scattering and the magnon dispersion, leading to J ∼0.13 eV. The hopping parameter t
is not accessible directly, but cluster calculations and other considerations
 allow only for a narrow range of t values. In our calculations we shall furtheron use (if
not declared diﬀerently) t = 0.4 eV and J/t = 0.3.A possible range for t′ 
is more controversial, while in numerical studies values −0.35 < t′/t < −0.2 are used.
Another prototype model for strongly correlated electrons is the traditional Hubbard model
 ,
jscis + H.c.) + U
High-energy excitations of the Hubbard model could be diﬀerent from those of the charge-transfer
regime in the three-band model, still it is expected that the low-energy properties map well on those
of the t-J model provided that U ≫t. In the following we shall mainly consider T > 0 properties
of the t-J model. It should be however noted that prior to the introduction of the FTLM method
most calculations of T > 0 properties have been performed for the Hubbard model by applying
QMC methods .
Finite-Temperature Lanczos Method
This chapter is devoted to the description of the FTLM which we developed for studying correlated systems at T > 0 and which is used to obtain results described
furtheron.
The goal was to calculate T > 0 properties in small model systems and to ﬁnd a
method, comparable in eﬃciency to g.s. calculations employing ED methods, used in the past
decade extensively in the study of correlated systems .
Here we should stress that the advantage of T > 0 calculations is twofold. It is evident that we
are interested in static and dynamical properties at nonzero T, in particular in their T-variation.
On the other hand, the use of ﬁnite but small T > 0 represents the proper approach to more reliable
g.s. calculations in small systems. Namely, it is well known that g.s. ED results, in particular for
dynamical quantities, are strongly inﬂuenced by ﬁnite size artifacts. At T > 0 the latter eﬀects can
to large extent average out, leading to more macroscopic-like results. Still the understanding of
remaining ﬁnite-size restrictions is important for the proper application of the method, as will be
described in Sec. 3.7. In Sec. 3.8. we put our approach in perspective with other methods yielding
T > 0 results for models of correlated electrons. These includes mainly various QMC methods and
the high-T expansion (HTE) technique.
Lanczos algorithm and matrix elements
The scarcity of well-controlled analytical approaches to models of strongly correlated electrons has
stimulated the development of computational methods. Conceptually the simplest is the ED method
of small systems. In models of correlated electrons, however, one is dealing with the dimension of
the basis (number of basis states) which grows exponentially with the size of the system. In the
Hubbard model there are 4 basis states for each lattice site, therefore the number of basis states
in the N-site system is Nst ∝4N. In the t −J model Nst still grows as ∝3N. In the ED of such
systems one is therefore representing operators with matrices Nst×Nst, which become large already
for very modest values of N. The helpful circumstance is that for most interesting operators and
lattice models only a small proportion of matrix elements is nonzero within the local basis. Then,
the operators can be represented by sparse matrices with Nst rows and at most f(N) nonzero
elements in each row. In this way memory requirements are relaxed and matrices up to Nst ∼107
are considered in recent applications. Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such large matrices is
not possible with standard algorithms performing the full diagonalization. One must instead resort
to the power algorithms , among which the Lanczos algorithm is
one of the most widely known.
The Lanczos algorithm starts with a normalized random vector |φ0⟩in the vector space in which
the Hamiltonian operator H is deﬁned. H is applied to |φ0⟩and the resulting vector is split in
components parallel to |φ0⟩, and |φ1⟩orthogonal to it, respectively,
H|φ0⟩= a0|φ0⟩+ b1|φ1⟩.
Since H is Hermitian, a0 = ⟨φ0|H|φ0⟩is real, while the phase of |φ1⟩can be chosen so that b1 is
also real. In the next step H is applied to |φ1⟩,
1|φ0⟩+ a1|φ1⟩+ b2|φ2⟩,
where |φ2⟩is orthogonal to |φ0⟩and |φ1⟩. It follows also b′
1 = ⟨φ0|H|φ1⟩= b1. Proceeding with the
iteration one gets in i steps
H|φi⟩= bi|φi−1⟩+ ai|φi⟩+ bi+1|φi+1⟩,
By stopping the iteration at i = M and putting the last coeﬃcient bM+1 = 0, the Hamiltonian can
be represented in the basis of orthogonal Lanczos functions |φi⟩as the tridiagonal matrix HM with
diagonal elements ai with i = 0 . . . M, and oﬀdiagonal ones bi with i = 1 . . . M. Such a matrix is
easily diagonalized using standard numerical routines to obtain approximate eigenvalues ǫj and the
corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors |ψj⟩,
j = 0 . . . M.
It is important to realize that |ψj⟩are (in general) not exact eigenfunctions of H, but show a
H|ψj⟩−ǫj|ψj⟩= bM+1vjM|φM+1⟩.
On the other hand it is evident from the diagonalization of HM that matrix elements
⟨ψi|H|ψj⟩= ǫjδij,
i, j = 0 . . . M
are exact, without restriction to the subspace LM.
If in the equation (3.3) bM+1 = 0, we have found a (M + 1)-dimensional eigenspace where HM
is already an exact representation of H. This inevitably happens when M = Nst −1, but for
M < Nst −1 it can only occur if the starting vector is orthogonal to some invariant subspace of H.
This should not be the case if the input vector |φ0⟩is random, without any hidden symmetries.
The number of operations needed to perform M Lanczos iterations scales as MNst. Numerically
the Lanczos procedure is subject to roundoﬀerrors, introduced by the ﬁnite-precision arithmetics.
This problem usually only becomes severe at larger M > 100 (more than needed to get accurate
|ψ0⟩) and is seen in the loss of the orthogonality of vectors |φi⟩.
It can be remedied by
successive reorthogonalization (and normalization) of new states |φ′
i⟩, plagued with errors, with
respect to previous ones. However this procedure requires ∼M2Nst operations, and can become
computationally more demanding than Lanczos iterations alone. This eﬀect prevents one to use
the Lanczos method e.g. to tridiagonalize large matrices.
The identity (3.6) already shows the usefulness of the Lanczos method for the calculation of
particular matrix elements. As an aid in a further discussion of the Lanczos method we consider
the calculation of a matrix element
Wkl = ⟨n|HkBHlA|n⟩,
where |n⟩is an arbitrary normalized vector, and A, B are general operators. One can calculate this
expression exactly by performing two Lanczos procedures with M = max(k, l) steps. The ﬁrst one,
starting with the vector |φ0⟩= |n⟩, produces the subspace LM = {|φj⟩, j = 0 . . . M} along with
approximate eigenvectors |ψj⟩and eigenvalues ǫj. The second Lanczos procedure is started with
the normalized vector
|˜φ0⟩= A|φ0⟩/
⟨φ0|A†A|φ0⟩,
and results in the subspace ˜LM = {|˜φj⟩, j = 0 . . . M} with approximate | ˜ψj⟩and ˜ǫj. We can now
deﬁne projectors
|˜φi⟩⟨˜φi|,
which for m = M can also be expressed as
| ˜ψi⟩⟨˜ψi|.
By taking into account deﬁnitions (3.9), (3.10) we show that
HPm = Pm+1HPm = PMHPm,
Since in addition |n⟩= |φ0⟩= P0|φ0⟩and A|n⟩∝|˜φ0⟩= P0|˜φ0⟩, by successive use of the ﬁrst
equality in (3.11) we arrive at
Wkl = ⟨φ0|P0HP1H . . . HPkB ˜PlH . . . ˜P1H ˜P0A|φ0⟩.
Using the second equality in the equation (3.11) and identities P0|φ0⟩= PM|φ0⟩, ˜P0A|φ0⟩=
˜PMA|φ0⟩we can rewrite Wkl as
Wkl = ⟨φ0|PMHPMH . . . HPMB ˜PMH . . . ˜PMH ˜PMA|φ0⟩.
We note that the necessary condition for the equation (3.13) is M ≥k, l. We ﬁnally expand the
projectors according to expressions (3.10) and take into account the orthonormality relation (3.6)
for matrix elements, and get
⟨φ0|ψi0⟩⟨ψi0|H|ψi1⟩. . . ⟨ψik−1|H|ψik⟩
×⟨ψik|B| ˜ψjl⟩⟨˜ψjl|H| ˜ψjl−1⟩. . . ⟨˜ψj1|H| ˜ψj0⟩⟨˜ψj0|A|φ0⟩=
⟨φ0|ψi⟩⟨ψi|B| ˜ψj⟩⟨˜ψj|A|φ0⟩(ǫi)k(˜ǫj)l.
We have thus expressed the desired quantity in terms of the Lanczos (approximate) eigenvectors,
and eigenvalues alone.
Dynamical response in the ground state
Within the Lanczos algorithm the extreme (smallest and largest) eigenvalues ǫi, along with their
corresponding |ψi⟩, are rapidly converging to exact eigenvalues Ei and eigenvectors |Ψi⟩. It is quite
characteristic that usually (for nondegenerate states) M = 30 −60 ≪Nst is suﬃcient to achieve
the convergence to the machine precision of the g.s. energy E0 and the wavefunction |Ψ0⟩, from
which various static and dynamical correlation functions at T = 0 can be evaluated.
After |Ψ0⟩is obtained, the g.s. dynamic correlation functions can be calculated within the same
framework . Let us consider the autocorrelation function
C(t) = −i⟨Ψ0|A†(t)A|Ψ0⟩= −i⟨Ψ0|A†ei(E0−H)tA|Ψ0⟩
with the transform,
dteiω+tC(t) = ⟨Ψ0|A†
ω+ + E0 −H A|Ψ0⟩.
where ω+ = ω + iǫ, ǫ > 0.
To calculate ˜C(ω), one has to run the second Lanczos procedure
starting with the normalized function |˜φ0⟩, equation (3.8). The matrix for H in the new basis ˜LM,
with elements ⟨˜φi|H|˜φj⟩= [ ˜HM]ij, is again a tridiagonal one with ˜ai and ˜bi elements, respectively.
Terminating the Lanczos procedure at given M, one can evaluate the ˜C(ω) as a resolvent of the
˜HM matrix which can be expressed in the continued-fraction form ,
⟨Ψ0|A†A|Ψ0⟩
ω+ + E0 −˜a0 −
ω+ + E0 −˜a1 −
ω+ + E0 −˜a2 −. . .
terminating with ˜bM+1 = 0, although other termination functions have also been employed.
The spectral function C(ω) = −(1/π)Im ˜C(ω) is characterized by frequency moments,
ωlC(ω)dω = ⟨Ψ0|A†(H −E0)lA|Ψ0⟩,
which are particular cases of the expression (3.7) for B = A†, k = 0, and |n⟩= |Ψ0⟩. Using the
equation (3.14) we can express µl for l ≤M in terms of Lanczos quantities alone
⟨Ψ0|A†| ˜ψj⟩⟨˜ψj|A|Ψ0⟩(˜ǫj −E0)l.
Hence moments are exact for given |Ψ0⟩(as would be also for any other starting |n⟩) provided
l ≤M. The corresponding approximation for C(t), equation (3.15), within the restricted set of
eigenfunctions | ˜ψj⟩, j = 0 . . . M, can be written at given M (assuming ˜bM+1 = 0) as
⟨Ψ0|A†| ˜ψj⟩⟨˜ψj|A|Ψ0⟩e−i(˜ǫj−E0)t.
Note that such C(t) expanded as a series in t (short-time expansion) has exact M terms, since the
coeﬃcients are just moments µl, equation (3.19).
As a practical matter we note that |⟨˜ψj|A|Ψ0⟩|2 = ˜v2
j0, hence no matrix elements need to be
evaluated within this approach. In contrast to the continued fraction (3.17), the expression (3.20)
allows also the treatment of more general correlation functions ⟨B(t)A⟩, with B ̸= A†. In this case
the matrix elements ⟨Ψ0|B| ˜ψj⟩have to be evaluated explicitly. From the above one sees that the
Lanczos method is very convenient to calculate the frequency moments as well as the dynamical
C(ω). Certain ideas presented above will be used to construct the algorithm for T > 0, discussed
in next subsections.
High-temperature expansion
The novel method for T > 0 is based on the application of the Lanczos iteration, reproducing
correctly high-T and large-ω series. The method is then combined with the reduction of the full
thermodynamic trace to the random sampling. We present these ingredients in the following.
We ﬁrst consider the expectation value of the operator A in the canonical ensemble
⟨n|e−βHA|n⟩
⟨n|e−βH|n⟩,
where β = 1/kBT. A straightforward calculation of ⟨A⟩requires the knowledge of all eigenstates
|Ψn⟩and corresponding energies En, obtained by the full diagonalization of H,
e−βEn⟨Ψn|A|Ψn⟩
computationally accessible only for Nst ∼5000. Instead let us perform the HTE of the exponential
⟨n|HkA|n⟩,
Terms in the expansion ⟨n|HkA|n⟩can be calculated exactly using the Lanczos procedure with
M ≥k steps and with |φn
0⟩= |n⟩as a starting function, since this is a special case of the expression
(3.7). Using the relation (3.14) with l = 0 and B = 1, we get
⟨n|HkA|n⟩=
i |A|n⟩(ǫn
Working in a restricted basis k ≤M, we can insert the expression (3.24) into sums (3.23), extending
them to k > M. The ﬁnal result can be expressed in analogy to the equation (3.20) as
and the error of the approximation is of the order of βM+1.
Evidently, within a ﬁnite system the expression (3.25), expanded as a series in β, reproduces
exactly the HTE series to the order M. In addition, in contrast to the usual HTE, it becomes
(remains) exact also for T →0. Let us assume for simplicity that the g.s. |Ψ0⟩is nondegenerate.
For initial states |n⟩not orthogonal to |Ψ0⟩, already at modest M ∼50 the lowest function |ψn
converges to |Ψ0⟩. We thus have for β →∞,
⟨n|Ψ0⟩⟨Ψ0|A|n⟩
⟨n|Ψ0⟩⟨Ψ0|n⟩=
⟨Ψ0|A|Ψ0⟩/⟨Ψ0|Ψ0⟩,
where we have taken into account the completeness of the set |n⟩. Obtained result is just the usual
g.s. expectation value of an operator.
Large-frequency expansion at T > 0
In order to calculate dynamical quantities, the HTE must be supplemented by the high-frequency
(short-time) expansion analogous to the one used at T = 0 in deriving the equation (3.20) from
(3.19). The goal is to calculate the dynamical correlation function at T > 0,
⟨B(t)A⟩= Tr
e−βHeiHtBe−iHtA
Expressing the trace explicitly and expanding the exponentials, we get
⟨B(t)A⟩= Z−1
(−β + it)k
⟨n|HkBHlA|n⟩.
Expansion coeﬃcients in equation (3.28) can be again obtained via the Lanczos method, as discussed
in Sec. 3.1. Performing two Lanczos iterations with M steps, started with normalized |φn
0⟩∝A|n⟩, respectively, we calculate coeﬃcients Wkl following the equation (3.14), while Z
is approximated by the static expression (3.25). Extending and resumming series in k and l into
exponentials, we get
⟨B(t)A⟩≈Z−1
We check again a nontrivial T = 0 limit of the above expression. If |n⟩are not orthogonal to
the g.s. |Ψ0⟩, then for large enough M the lowest-lying state converges to ǫn
0 ∼E0 and |ψn
respectively. In this case we have in analogy to the equation (3.26)
eit(E0−˜ǫn
j )⟨Ψ0|B| ˜ψn
Generally larger M ≫100 are needed in order that relevant higher-lying states | ˜ψn
j ⟩and ˜ǫn
independent of |n⟩.
Only in such a limit we recover strictly the g.s.
result, corresponding for
A† →B to the equation (3.16). Note however that similar restrictions apply to the continued
fraction expansion (3.17) which reproduces correctly moments µl (3.18) up to l < M, but not
necessarily the details (e.g. positions and weights of peaks) of the C(ω) spectrum.
Random sampling
The computation of static quantities (3.25) and dynamical ones (3.29) still involves the summation
over the complete set of Nst states |n⟩, which is not feasible in practice. To obtain a useful method,
one further approximation must be made which replaces the full summation by a partial one over a
much smaller set of random states . Such an approximation analogous
to Monte Carlo methods is of course hard to justify rigorously, nevertheless we can estimate the
errors involved.
We consider the expectation value ⟨A⟩at T > 0, as deﬁned by the expression (3.21). Instead
of the whole sum in equation (3.21) we ﬁrst evaluate only one element with respect to a random
state |r⟩, which is a linear combination of basis states
i.e. βrn are assumed to be distributed randomly. Let us discuss then the random quantity
⟨r|e−βHA|r⟩/⟨r|e−βH|r⟩=
rnβrm⟨n|e−βHA|m⟩
rnβrm⟨n|e−βH|m⟩.
We choose for convenience that here basis states |n⟩correspond to the eigenstates of H. We ﬁrst
assume in addition that [H, A] = 0, to diagonalize simultaneously both A and H. Then we have
|βrn|2⟨n|e−βHA|n⟩
|βrn|2⟨n|e−βH|n⟩.
We can express |βrn|2 = 1/Nst + δrn, where random deviations δrn are not correlated with matrix
elements ⟨n|e−βH|n⟩= Zn and ⟨n|e−βHA|n⟩= ZnAn. It is then easy to see that ˜Ar is close to ⟨A⟩,
and the statistical deviation is related to the eﬀective number of terms ˜Z in the thermodynamic
˜Ar = ⟨A⟩+ O(1/
¯Z = eβE0 X
Note that for T →∞we have ¯Z →Nst and therefore at large Nst a close estimate of the average
(3.34) can be obtained from a single random state . On the other hand, at ﬁnite T < ∞the statistical error of ˜Ar increases with decreasing
¯Z. Still, strictly at T = 0 and for a nondegenerate g.s. we obtain from equation (3.33) again the
correct result.
In the FTLM we replace the full summation in the expression (3.21) with a restricted one over
several random vectors |r⟩, r = 1 . . . R,
⟨r|e−βHA|r⟩
⟨r|e−βH|r⟩.
From equations (3.33) and (3.34) it follows that the statistical error is even reduced,
˜A = ⟨A⟩+ O(1/
For a general A, not commuting with H, we have to consider also the contribution of oﬀdiagonal
terms in the equation (3.32). Since the phases of random coeﬃcients βrn are randomly distributed,
we can expect that vectors βrn are approximately orthogonal,
(δnm + ζnm/
where |ζnm| = O(1). The relative contribution of oﬀdiagonal terms is then given by
w(R, Nst) =
⟨n|e−βHA|m⟩ζnm
⟨n|e−βHA|n⟩.
It is not easy to estimate the ratio w in general. First we note that at β →0 we could choose |n⟩
to diagonalize A, so oﬀdiagonal terms could be avoided anyhow (for a static operator A). This is
however not the case for low T. If we assume that the sign of ζnm is random and uncorrelated with
matrix elements ⟨n|e−βHA|m⟩, we can put an upper bound w(R, Nst) < 1/
R. There are however
several arguments, e.g. operators A are usually local leading to a sparse-matrix representation,
which seem to indicate a much smaller contribution of oﬀdiagonal terms.
To conclude, taking into account all assumptions mentioned, the approximation ˜A (3.35) should
therefore yield a good estimate of the thermodynamic average ⟨A⟩at all T. For low T the error
is expected to be of the order of O(1/
R), while for high T the error is expected to scale even as
O(1/√NstR). Since arguments leading to these estimates rely on several assumptions which are
not easy to verify, it is essential to test the method for particular cases.
Implementation and tests
We comment now on the practical implementation of the FTLM and present few tests in order to
get a quantitative estimate of approximations mentioned above. First we consider the calculation
of static quantities. Joining the HTE and the random sampling we approximate the average of the
operator A as
The sampling is over R random states |r⟩= |φr
0⟩, which serve as initial functions for the M-step
Lanczos procedure, resulting in M approximate eigenvalues ǫr
j with corresponding eigenvectors |ψr
For a general operator A the calculation of eigenfunctions |ψr
j⟩and corresponding matrix elements ⟨ψr
j|A|r⟩is needed. On the other hand, the calculation eﬀort is signiﬁcantly reduced if
[H, A] = 0 and A can be diagonalized simultaneously. Then
In this case the evaluation of eigenfunctions is not necessary since the element ⟨r|ψr
j0, equation
(3.4), is obtained directly from eigenvectors of the tridiagonal matrix Hr
Few remarks on the implementation are in order here. Already in usual g.s. Lanczos calculations
the use of symmetries of the model Hamiltonian is crucial in order to reduce computational and
storage requirements. This is even more important when using the FTLM where the computational
burden is increased due to the sampling and due to the calculation of matrix elements. At T > 0 in
general all symmetry sectors must be taken into account and these can diﬀer signiﬁcantly regarding
the number of basis states they contain.
Formulas (3.39), (3.40) must then be generalized to
allow for the varying number of samples in each sector, so that sectors containing more states are
more thoroughly sampled. If in the symmetry sector s containing N s
st basis states Rs samples are
evaluated, then the random sampling summation is modiﬁed as
Usually we choose Rs ∝N s
st. The number of Lanczos steps can also be taken as sector dependent,
st. This is important in sectors with small dimensions N s
Calculations on ﬁnite systems can be carried out on diﬀerent lattices with various boundary
conditions. For planar problems it is convenient to use tilted square lattices of sizes N = n2 + m2
 with periodic boundary conditions (p.b.c.). The translational invariance
of lattice Hamiltonians is preserved on such systems, which makes crystal momenta ⃗k good quantum
numbers and enables to reduce the basis of states and their dimension N s
Let us test the method for static quantities on the problem of a Heisenberg model on a twoleg ladder.
We discuss the case J = J′ (exchange equal along and perpendicular the ladder)
which exhibits the spin gap. One of the most interesting quantities in this system is the uniform
susceptibility χ0 = ⟨(Stot
z )2⟩/TN (deﬁned and discussed in more detail for doped AFM in Sec. 6.2)
and its T dependence. As a test we choose the model on a N = 2 × 8 ladder, for which the exact
results obtained by full diagonalization are available . In Fig. 3.1a we study
the inﬂuence of the number of Lanczos steps M on the accuracy of results. These are shown for
ﬁxed sampling R = 1028, while M is varied from 5 to 20. It is rather surprising that even with
the smallest M = 5 in the largest symmetry sector we obtain very good agreement with the exact
result not only at high T > J, but as well as at low T < J. In this case this is likely to be due to
the gap in the energy spectrum, as expected for ladders with even number of legs.
In Fig. 3.1b we ﬁx M = 30, while the number of random samples R varies. Note that using
the translational symmetry and the conservation of total Stot
= Sz the maximum number of states
in a symmetry sector is N s
st = 820, while the total number of states is Nst = 216 = 65536. The
number of samples within each symmetry sector Rs is chosen to be proportional to the number
of basis states in the sector. In the largest sector N s
st = 820 this amounts to Rs = 2 −13 for
the cases with total R = 180 −1028, respectively. This corresponds to the sampling in the range
R/Nst = 0.003−0.016. We ﬁrst observe that almost regardless of the sampling results agree closely
with the exact one at higher T > J, as expected from the discussion of the statistical error in the
equation (3.36). At T < J results start to disagree, still Rs ≫1 leads also to an improved accuracy
in this regime.
Let us turn now to the calculation of dynamical quantities. By joining equation (3.29) with the
random sampling (3.35), we get the frequency-dependent correlation function
⟨B(t)A⟩ω ≈πNst
Figure 3.1:
Uniform susceptibility χ0 vs. T for the 2 × 8-site Heisenberg spin ladder, as obtained
using the FTLM with a) ﬁxed sampling R = 1028 and various number of Lanczos steps M, and
b) ﬁxed M = 30 and diﬀerent number of random samples R. Exact results are taken from Barnes
and Riera .
The sampling is over R random states |r⟩, resulting in M approximate eigenfunctions |ψr
i ⟩, | ˜ψr
and corresponding ǫr
j, respectively.
At the full sampling R = Nst and within the chosen system the number of Lanczos steps M
determines the number of exact frequency moments µl, analogous to g.s. moments (3.19). This
is evident from the expansion (3.28) at least for β →0, while for lower T we are dealing with a
double expansion, i.e. β and t series, and combined moments are exact. It follows that at least at
high T the frequency resolution in spectra is ∆ω ∼∆E/M, ∆E representing typically the energy
span of the model. Since the information content in higher moments is limited, in particular due
to ﬁnite-size eﬀects, there is no point in using very large M, hence we restrict our calculation in
most cases to M < 200. The eﬀects of using a reduced sampling R ≪Nst are expected to be most
pronounced at low T where moreover only a minority of symmetry sectors with the lowest energies
contributes.
Several tests for dynamical quantities within the t-J model (2.6) have been already presented
by Jakliˇc and Prelovˇsek . Here we consider in addition the spectral function of a
single hole injected in the undoped AFM, A(⃗k, ω) ∝Re⟨c†
⃗ks(t)c⃗ks(0)⟩ω, deﬁned and discussed in
more detail in Sec. 7.2. We choose the system of 4 × 4 sites with J/t = 0.5 and ⃗k∗= (π/2, π/2)
corresponding to the g.s. wavevector. We compare T = 0 results, being the most stringent test
for the FTLM, with the g.s. ED results . In Fig. 3.2
we ﬁrst show the convergence of the spectral function at T = 0 with the sampling Rs (note that
for T = 0 only g.s. symmetry sectors have to be considered) for a ﬁxed number of Lanczos steps
M = 180. Note that M determines also the number of correct T = 0 frequency moments. We
observe that the position of peaks in the spectrum is mainly unaﬀected by the sampling. Low-
ω peaks are known to be quite accurate within the T = 0 ED method, hence also their positions
within the FTLM. Their intensities are less reliable at smaller sampling and also frequency moments
are expected to have larger errors. However, by increasing Rs the accuracy of peak intensities is
Figure 3.2:
Spectral function A(⃗k∗, ω) of a single hole in an AFM at T = 0. The g.s. ED result
and the FTLM results for diﬀerent random sampling Rs are shown, at ﬁxed M = 180.
We investigate further the eﬀect of reducing the number of Lanczos steps M.
In Fig. 3.3
the spectral function at T →∞is calculated with R = 32 and varying M. We observe regular
oscillations for lowest M = 30, 60, appearing in frequency intervals ∆ω ∼∆E/M, where ∆E is
the maximum energy span in the model. We have only a partial explanation of this phenomenon,
typical for high T. While the Lanczos algorithm obtains correct lowest and highest eigenvalues,
Lanczos eigenvalues in the middle of the spectrum do not have any correspondence with true ones
(as evident already from the discrepancy in their number M ≪N s
st) and appear almost equidistant.
At T →∞they all contribute and yield observed oscillations. Since oscillations do not contain any
relevant information, they can be easily smoothened out by a suitable ﬁltering. They also become
much less pronounced at lower T, where the predominant contribution is given by transitions from
the states in the lower part of the spectrum to excited states.
Finite size eﬀects
We introduce and justify the FTLM as a method to calculate T > 0 properties on small systems.
We also argue that choosing appropriate M, and the sampling R one can reproduce exact results
to prescribed precision on a given system. In this sense the method is very eﬀective, in its computational eﬀort comparable (although more time and memory consuming) to g.s. ED calculations
on the same system. Still the well known deﬁciency of the ED method is the smallness of available
lattices. Hence it is important to understand the ﬁnite size eﬀects and their role at T > 0. In the
following we predominantly study planar systems corresponding to the tilted square lattice with
p.b.c. where N = n2 + m2. Mostly, we employ N = 16, 18, 20, 26, as
presented in Fig. 3.4.
Figure 3.3:
A(⃗k∗, ω) at large T ≫t. The dependence on M is shown at ﬁxed R = 32.
Figure 3.4:
Tilted square lattices with p.b.c. corresponding to diﬀerent sizes.
We claim that generally T > 0 reduces ﬁnite size eﬀects. This is related to the fact that at
T = 0 both static and dynamical quantities are calculated only from one wavefunction |Ψ0⟩, which
can be quite dependent on the size and on the shape of the system. In particular, g.s. spectra of
dynamical quantities , e.g. the optical conductivity 
and the single-particle spectral function , quite generally appear as a
restricted number of delta functions. While lowest frequency moments, in the sense of equations
(3.18), can be quite representative of a large system, the peak-like structure and details of spectra
are mostly not.
T > 0 introduces the thermodynamic averaging over a larger number of eigenstates.
reduces directly ﬁnite-size eﬀects for static quantities, whereas for dynamical quantities spectra
become denser.
From the equation (3.42) it follows that we get in spectra at elevated T > 0
generally RM2 diﬀerent peaks leading to nearly continuous spectra.
This is also evident from
high-T result in Fig. 3.3, as compared to the T = 0 result in Fig. 3.2.
The eﬀect of T > 0 can be expressed also in another way. There are several characteristic length
scales in the system of correlated electrons, e.g. the AFM correlation length ξ, the transport mean
Figure 3.5:
Many-body levels for: (a) the 2D Heisenberg model on N = 16 sites, (b) the 2D t-J
model with Nh = 2 on N = 10 sites. In both cases only the Sz = 0, k = 0 sector is presented.
free path ls, etc. These lengths decrease with increasing T and results for related quantities have a
macroscopic relevance provided that the lengths become shorter than the system size, e.g. ls < L
where L is the linear size of the system. This happens for particular T > Ts, where clearly Ts
depends also on the quantity considered. For certain quantities one can monitor such conditions
directly, e.g. for ls as discussed in more detail in Sec. 5.
As a criterion for ﬁnite size eﬀects we use the characteristic ﬁnite-size temperature Tfs. It is
chosen so that in a given system the thermodynamic sum
¯Z(T) = Tre−β(H−E0)
is appreciable, i.e. ¯Z(Tfs) = Z∗≫1.
To get the size dependence of Tfs it is important to understand general features of many body
spectra. In Fig. 3.5a we present the levels of the Heisenberg model on a square lattice with N = 16
sites for the Sz = 0, k = 0 sector.
Note that energy span is ∆E ∝NJ while the number of
states scales as N s
st ∝2N. This means that the density of states far from spectral edges scales
exponentially with N. On the other hand, near the edges spectra become sparse and the spacing
between lowest levels decreases rather slowly with the size, i.e. ∆ǫ ∝N −p. We expect that also
Tfs scales as ∆ǫ. Still the character and the density of low-lying states can change qualitatively
from one regime to another. In Fig. 3.5b we show for comparison the levels within the t-J model
with Nh = 2 holes on the tilted square lattice with N = 10 sites, again only for the Sz = 0, k = 0
sector. While both cases have similar N s
st, it is evident that the low-energy regime shows much
higher density of states in doped t-J model, Fig. 3.5b, indicating a large degeneracy of states at
The FTLM is best suited just for quantum many-body systems with a large degeneracy of

The variation of Tfs with doping ch in the t-J on N = 18 sites with J/t = 0.3. Curves
correspond to diﬀerent choices of Z∗= ¯Z(Tfs).
states, i.e. large ¯Z at low T. This is the case with doped AFM and the t-J model in the strong
correlation regime J < t. To be concrete we present in Fig. 3.6 the variation of Tfs with the doping
ch = Nh/N, as calculated from the system of N = 18 sites and J/t = 0.3. For convenience we ﬁx
Tfs with criteria Z∗= 30, 100, 300, respectively. It is indicative that Tfs reaches the minimum for
intermediate (optimum) doping ch = c∗
h ∼0.15, where we are able to reach Tfs/J ≲0.3. Away
from such optimum case Tfs is larger. In the undoped (and underdoped) AFM this happens due to
rather large ﬁnite-size gaps in magnon excitations, while in the overdoped system electrons behave
closer to free electrons with a nearly unrenormalized bandwidth and hence large gaps between
single-electron excited states. We claim that small Tfs and related large degeneracy of low-lying
states are the essential features of strongly correlated system in their most challenging regime, being
a sign of a novel quantum frustration. On the other hand this gives an advantage to the FTLM
which performs best where several other methods, like QMC, fail due to the same frustration (sign)
Relation to other numerical methods
It is not our intention to give an exhaustive overview of other numerical (or partly analytical)
methods which are used in the analysis of the problem of strongly correlated electrons, and for
doped AFM in particular.
We mainly list below methods which are alternative to the FTLM,
together with their limitations and advantages. Since T > 0 calculations are often used as a proper
approach to T = 0 results, as is also the case for several quantities evaluated within the FTLM
furtheron, we comment also on some g.s. calculations.
Clearly the closest relation is with the ED studies of small systems. Apart from the FTLM only
few studies of T > 0 properties of the t-J model and of the Heisenberg model have been performed
 , restricted to small N and in
particular small N s
st ≲1000 due to the full diagonalization employed in these calculations. We note
that such restricted Nst can inﬂuence in particular dynamical spectra, which can show up ﬁnite
size eﬀects even at higher T. We should also note that quite an analogous method to the FTLM,
based instead on the Chebyshev iteration, has been introduced recently ,
but has not been exploited much so far.
Much more extensive ED calculations have been performed for g.s. properties . While systems considered could be possibly somewhat larger than those reachable within
the FTLM, we claim that in particular dynamical spectra as evaluated within the g.s. should be
interpreted with care due to their sparse structure. This seems to be the case with the g.s. optical
conductivity, the spin structure factor, spectral functions etc., as discussed in detail furtheron.
Closely related to the FTLM (see Sec. 3.3) is the HTE approach, which in principle deals with
a large (inﬁnite) system and is one of few straightforward (at least partly) analytical methods for
correlated systems.
It uses β as a small parameter for the series expansion, while appropriate
extrapolations (e.g. using Pade approximants) are needed to obtain results for T in the physically
interesting regime. So far it has been used in several studies of the t-J model, e.g. to address
the question of the phase separation , magnetic correlations , the momentum-distribution function , the chargespin separation , the Hall eﬀect etc. The advantage of
the method is the absence of any ﬁnite cluster bounds. On the other hand the method requires a
careful and a nonunique extrapolation procedure which is reliable only for static quantities.
Widely used QMC technique yields in general results for T > 0. There are various methods,
which have been covered in several recent reviews . We mention
here only approaches which are relevant for studies of planar undoped and doped AFM. The worldline QMC has been very successful in the evaluation of static properties of the Heisenberg model
 .
Analogous results have been obtained via the QMC for the insulating
Hubbard model at half-ﬁlling . Away from the half-ﬁlling the sign problem becomes
the major diﬃculty for the QMC studies of fermionic models. It is particularly severe at low T
within the intermediate-doping regime, being thus connected with the large degeneracy of fermionic
states. Still various static quantities have been evaluated within the Hubbard model as a function
od doping both for T = 0 and T > 0 .
The calculation of dynamical quantities within the QMC is possible via the deconvolution of the
imaginary-time dynamics into a real-frequency one using the maximum entropy analysis . The latter appears to be quite delicate due a large inﬂuence of statistical errors. Still
there has been in recent years several studies of dynamic properties of spin systems and of the planar Hubbard model, in particular of spectral functions . In spite of much larger systems reachable within QMC studies, it
is well conceivable that due to inherent diﬃculties QMC results for dynamics are less reliable than
those obtained within the FTLM.
There are other powerful numerical methods which are only partly relevant to studies of doped
AFM. Particularly successful and promising is the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG)
approach, as developed by White and extensively applied to problems of correlated electrons.
While designed mainly for 1D systems, it has been extended to ladder systems as well as to planar models . So far appropriate generalizations
in order to study the T > 0 and dynamical properties have only been attempted .
Thermodynamic properties
We ﬁrst consider thermodynamic properties of the t-J model . These
include quantities directly derivable from the grand-canonical sum Ω: free energy density F, chemical potential µ, charge compressibility κ, entropy density s, speciﬁc heat CV etc. Some of these
have been already studied using other methods. Within the HTE some thermodynamical quantities
have been calculated within the t-J model. Results indicate the ferromagnetic phase at J ≪t and
at low doping , but also a large enhancement of the entropy in a doped AFM
(Putikka, unpublished). Within the Hubbard model the projector (T = 0) QMC method has been
employed to study the phase diagram and to calculate the charge compressibility . Several calculations of the chemical potential vs. doping within the Green’s function
QMC have been presented in order to establish the regime of the phase separation , although with contradictory conclusions for the most interesting
regime J < t.
In order to study continuously varying particle densities, we perform the averaging within the
grand-canonical ensemble, involving all possible numbers of electrons Ne,
TrNe[e−β(H−µNe)A]/
TrNee−β(H−µNe),
where µ is the chemical potential. For each Ne the problem thus reduces to the evaluation of the
canonical thermal average, which we achieve with the FTLM as described in Sec. 3.
The implementation of the FTLM can be further simpliﬁed for operators A which are conserved
quantities, i.e. commute with H, as shown in Sec. 3.6. Examples include H itself, the particle
number Ne, the total spin Sz etc. By choosing random functions |r⟩to have good quantum numbers
Ne and Sz, we can evaluate the expectation value of an arbitrary function f(Ne, Sz, H)
j⟩|2e−β(ǫr
As noted in the equation (3.40), in this case |⟨r|ψr
j⟩|2 can be evaluated from the tridiagonal matrix
directly. Since also M ≲100 is enough, the reorthogonalization of Lanczos functions can be avoided.
This eliminates the need to store wavefunctions |φr
j⟩and systems with considerably larger Nst can
be studied. Consequently the computational eﬀort in this case is equal to that of a g.s. Lanczos
procedure, repeated R times. We employ in the following typically R ∼200 −1000 in each Ne
sector. Calculations are performed on systems with N = 16, 18, and 20 sites for arbitrary ﬁlling
ch, while for the undoped system we reach N = 26 sites. Note also that we ﬁx J/t = 0.3.
Chemical potential
We ﬁrst analyze the hole chemical potential µh = −µ as a function of T and of the hole density
ch = 1 −⟨Ne⟩/N. Results are obtained by ﬁrst calculating ch at ﬁxed µ, T from equations (4.2)
with f = Ne, and then inverting the dependence ch(µ, T). In Fig. 4.1 we present curves µh(T) for
several ch. Note that for thermodynamic quantities results seem somewhat less sensitive to ﬁnitesize eﬀects, hence we follow them in Fig. 4.1 to T ∼0.05 t (for ch ≤0.1 we would still estimate
Figure 4.1:
Hole chemical potential µh vs. T at several dopings ch.
higher Tfs ∼0.1 t). In order to interpret µh(T) at low ch ≪1 it is essential to note that at T = 0
the system contains no holes in the equilibrium provided µh < µ0
h. For chosen J/t = 0.3 it has been
established µ0
h ∼−1.99 t , related to the minimum energy of a single hole added to
the undoped AFM.
Analyzing Fig. 4.1 we mostly do not ﬁnd a T 2 dependence of µh at low T, as expected for a
normal LFL, except within the extremely overdoped regime ch ≥0.3. In particular, in a broad
range 0.05 < ch < 0.3 we ﬁnd a very unusual roughly linear variation,
µh(T) = µh(T = 0) + αT,
Tfs < T < J,
whereby the slope α changes the sign at ch = c∗
h ≳0.15. It is remarkable that the marginal doping
h appears to be quite system independent, as checked quantitatively for diﬀerent system sizes
N = 16 −20.
The marginal c∗
h shows up again in Fig. 4.2, displaying the variation ch(∆µ) at various temperatures T. Here ∆µ = µ + µ0
h is the diﬀerence to the undoped AFM case and is displayed in eV to
allow the comparison with experiments, using the usual correspondence t = 0.4 eV. c∗
h represents
in this case the crossing of curves at diﬀerent T, whereby ∆µ(T) is essentially pinned at the value
∆µ ∼−0.17 t. This pinning is active in a wide range of T. Analyzing the regime ch < c∗
Fig. 4.2, we note again that ch(T →0) remains ﬁnite only for µh < µ0
h. One can evaluate from
these results the compressibility of the hole ﬂuid κ ∝−dch/dµ. We ﬁnd that κ < ∞for all T > 0,
indicating the absence of the phase separation in the system at chosen J/t. This is in contrast with
some recent QMC studies claiming the phase separation in the
t-J model at all J/t, as ﬁrst put forward by Emery et al. . Our results in Fig. 4.2 do not
support such a behaviour, at least not in the range T/t > 0.05. Still Fig. 4.2 reveals that κ(T →0)
is increasing and becoming larger on approaching ∆µ ∼0.
A proper interpretation of the regime ch →0 at low T is clearly one of the major challenges.
One frequently used picture is that holes doped in an AFM could be described as degenerate
fermions with small FS - hole pockets . In this case one
experiment

Hole concentration ch vs. ∆µ at various T. For comparison we show experimental
results for LSCO at low T, obtained from the shift of photoemission spectra by Ino et al. .
would expect in a 2D lattice κ = N(µ) = 1/2πt∗, where N(ǫ) is the single-particle (hole) density
of states (DOS) and t∗an eﬀective hopping parameter. Since the hole eﬀective mass can be quite
enhanced, i.e. t∗≪t, κ can become quite large. Results in Fig. 4.2 put a lower bound to the
possible enhancement, i.e. t/t∗> 5.
Analyzing T = 0 QMC results for the Hubbard model near half ﬁlling a variation ch(µh),
similar to ours, has been found . Results were
interpreted in terms of a singular behaviour κ ∝(µh −µ0
h)−1/2. In contrast to the hole-pocket
picture, the latter form does not allow for a regime with a degenerate gas of holes, at least not
with holes having a doping-independent mass. From our results it is hard to exclude any of these
scenarios, whereby the regime of hole pockets should be in any case restricted to very low doping
It is tempting to interpret the existence of the marginal concentration c∗
h as a change of the
character of the FS. To establish the relation, we have to rely on arguments which apply to the
gas of noninteracting fermions. A simple Sommerfeld expansion yields that the electron density at
ﬁxed µ is given by
ce(T) = ce(T = 0) + (πkBT)2
Indirectly this gives an information on the FS, since one would plausibly associate N ′(µ) > 0 for
ce ≲1 with a large electron FS, and oppositely N ′(µ) < 0 with a hole-like FS or small hole pockets
vanishing for ce →1. At least for free electrons it is easy to establish the connection of N ′(µ) with
the curvature K−1 of the FS , analogous to the relation for the Hall
resistivity . At least in the region of the ⃗k space, where the eﬀective-mass tensor is
positive-deﬁnite, N ′(µ) > 0 implies also that the average FS curvature K−1 is positive.
The observed nonquadratic T dependence in Fig. 4.1 questions the interpretation in terms of the
free-electron DOS (4.4). Still we may interpret dch/dT < 0 for ch > c∗
h, as deduced from Fig. 4.2,
as an indication for N ′(µ) > 0, i.e. positive average curvature of the FS. This in turn implies a
Figure 4.3:
Entropy density s vs. T for diﬀerent dopings ch for a) J/t = 0.3, and b) J = 0.
transition at ch ∼c∗
h from a hole-pocket picture at low doping , to an electron-like large FS .
Recently the variation of µ with the hole doping in LSCO has been deduced experimentally
from the shift of photoemission spectra by Ino et al. . For comparison we plot also these
results in Fig. 4.2, noting that they apply to low T in terms of our model parameters. The overall
agreement is quite reasonable, taking into account the uncertainty of PES results. Again the ﬂatness
of µ(ch < c∗
h) is quite remarkable, indicating on the possibility of divergent κ →∞for ch →0. As
noted already by the authors the variation µ(ch) is highly nontrivial and cannot be accounted for
by a simple LFL results as e.g. obtained in band structure calculations.
Let us consider the entropy density (per unit cell)
kB ln Ω+ ⟨H⟩−µ⟨Ne⟩
where averages and Ωare calculated using the FTLM with
equations (4.2). Within the t-J model s has been studied also via the HTE (Putikka, unpublished),
while the QMC method has been recently used to calculate the entropy within the Hubbard model
 .
The T variation of s at various ch is presented in Fig. 4.3a. Note again that within the grandcanonical calculation ch can be followed continuously. Results shown for N = 20 are quite close to
those for lattices with N = 16, 18 sites provided that T > 0.1 t. It is evident that in the undoped
AFM s(T) at low T < J/2 is consistent with the magnon contribution s ∝T 2. This dependence
changes however already for smallest ﬁnite doping ch = 0.05 to s ∝T α with α ≲1.
In order to understand the role of AFM correlations induced by J > 0 on the entropy s, we
present in Fig. 4.3b also results obtained for J = 0. It is clear that here the undoped case ch = 0
Figure 4.4:
s vs. ch at several T, calculated in a system with N = 20 sites. We show for comparison
also experimental results for LSCO by Loram et al. at highest T = 320 K ∼0.07 t.
is singular, since s(T > 0) = ln 2. It is also plausible that for ch ≳0.3 we ﬁnd s(T) essentially
independent of J, i.e. the spin exchange becomes irrelevant in the overdoped regime. Comparison
again conﬁrms that the role of J is crucial in the underdoped regime and at optimum doping.
Alternatively we can discuss the doping dependence of s, as shown in Fig. 4.4 at diﬀerent T ≤J.
As realized already from the discussion of the thermodynamic sum Z(T) and related Tfs(ch) in
Fig. 3.6, the entropy displays a broad maximum at ch ∼0.15, indicating the highest density of
many-body states in the optimum-doping regime. The appearance of the maximum in s(ch) is
intimately related to µ(T) discussed in Sec. 4.1. Namely from general thermodynamic relations
(equality of mixed derivatives) for the free energy density F(ch, T) it follows
taking into account that s = −∂F/∂T and µh = ∂F/∂ch. The relation (4.6) connects s(ch) = max
with the pinning of µh(T) seen in Figs. 4.1, 4.2 at the optimum doping ch ∼c∗
Besides the enhancement of s with doping, the surprising fact is also its magnitude at T < J,
i.e. at small T in terms of model parameters. s in the optimum regime appears very large, e.g. at
T = 0.1 t = J/3 the entropy per site is s ∼0.39 kB, which is almost 40% of s(T = ∞) for the same
ch, although T < J and the energy span of excitations extends well beyond the scale ∆E > t. This
should be contrasted with the situation in an undoped AFM, where s becomes relatively signiﬁcant
only for T > J/2, and saturates for T ≳J. Moreover, in the case of noninteracting fermions one
gets s ∼kB only at the Fermi temperature T 0
F ∼W, where the bandwidth is W = 8 t. On the other
hand, by introducing the degeneracy temperature within the t-J model as s(Tdeg) = s(T = ∞)/2,
we get for ch ∼c∗
h only Tdeg ∼0.17 t, being small in comparison with any reasonable eﬀective QP
bandwidth.
It is indicative that the entropy of such a magnitude has been deduced from the electronic
speciﬁc heat measurements in oxygen deﬁcient YBa2Cu3O7−δ (YBCO) materials (Loram et al.
E.g., for the optimally doped material with δ = 0.03 at T = 300 K the experimental
result is ∆s = 0.35 kB per planar copper site (∆s = 0.7 kB per formula unit), relative to the
Figure 4.5:
Speciﬁc heat CV vs. T for the undoped AFM for several system sizes.
undoped δ = 1 sample. We ﬁnd the corresponding value ∆s = s(ch = 0.15) −s(ch = 0) ∼0.30 kB
at T = 0.1 t ∼450 K. Recently, s has been measured also for LSCO in a large doping range
0 < x < 0.4 . We plot results at ﬁxed T = 320K ∼0.07 t as a function of doping
in Fig. 4.4, for comparison with our model results. The qualitative and quantitative agreement is
quite promising, also in view of possible uncertainties in the experimental determination of s. When
comparing results we note that our curves start at higher T and so the main diﬀerence is in the
location of the entropy maximum, which in LSCO appears at somewhat higher ch ∼0.22.
Speciﬁc heat
The same results can be discussed in terms of the speciﬁc heat (per unit cell)
which can be as well represented directly with expectation values at given T, analogous to the
equation (4.5) and a diﬀerentiation with respect to T is not needed. Let us ﬁrst show as a test
CV for the undoped AFM (Heisenberg model) for several system sizes.
In Fig. 4.5 results are
shown for systems ranging in size from 16 to 26 sites.
Except at the lowest T ≲J/3, results
do not vary appreciably with the system size, particularly regarding the position and the height
of the maximum. Our results seem to be even superior to those obtained by the QMC method
 . Calculated CV is strongly T dependent in the whole T range, with a
maximum at T ∼2J/3, and as expected CV ∝T 2 at low T consistent with the magnon excitations
dominating this regime .
In Fig. 4.6 we present CV (T) at diﬀerent ch. As the AFM is doped, CV (T) still exhibits a
maximum, which is however strongly suppressed and gradually moves to lower T with increasing
ch. The peak can be attributed to the thermal activation of spin degrees of freedom. The latter
are still characterized by the exchange scale J which persists in the doped system, as observed
Figure 4.6:
CV vs. T for diﬀerent hole dopings ch.
also in dynamical spin correlations discussed in Sec. 6. The exchange
energy scale however disappears in the overdoped regime ch ≥0.3. Results indicate a possible LFL
behaviour with CV ∼γT only for T < 0.1 t. It is characteristic (and consistent with the vanishing
role of J) that in the optimally doped regime ch ∼0.2 we ﬁnd CV (T) ∼const for 0.15 < T/t < 1,
being far from a FL behaviour.
Results in Fig. 4.6 conﬁrm the recent conjecture that in correlated systems
the speciﬁc heat CV (T, X) can show universal crossings as a function of a thermodynamic variable
X. In our case we consider X = ch, and realize that CV (T) cross for diﬀerent ch at two T, whereby
the lower crossing at T ∼0.13 t seems to be nearly independent of ch.
Electrical Properties
The anomalous normal-state character of electrical transport properties has been realized since the
discovery of high-Tc cuprates and remains the challenge for theoreticians ever since. Among these
properties the prominent example is nearly linear in-plane resistivity ρ ∝T in the normal state
 .
It is however an experimental fact that such
a behaviour is restricted to the optimum doping regime, while deviations from linearity appear
both in the underdoped and overdoped regimes, being still universal for a number of materials
with a similar doping . The d.c. resistivity is intimately related to the optical
conductivity σ(ω), which has been also extensively studied and shows in the normal state the unusual non-Drude behaviour . Another challenging set of experimental ﬁndings concern the d.c. resistivity ρc(T)
perpendicular to the CuO2 planes and the corresponding σc(ω) , which we will
not consider here.
The central question is whether these anomalous static and dynamical transport properties can
be accounted for by strong correlations alone, or possible other mechanisms such as the electronphonon coupling have to be invoked . In spite of considerable eﬀorts so far there
are very few microscopical theories of electron transport dealing with planar or higher-dimensional
strongly correlated systems.
Brinkman and Rice solved the problem of a single mobile hole in the extreme case
J = 0 within the retraceable-path approximation (RPA) and evaluated the d.c. mobility µ0(T).
Analogous results have been obtained via the HTE by Ohata and Kubo . Within the RPA
also σ(ω) has been evaluated . It is not easy to ﬁnd the range of validity and
relevance of these results, in particular for J > 0 where one would expect possibly a crossover to a
diﬀerent relaxation mechanism for T < J. Nevertheless it is clear that the analysis, treating holes as
independent, is more appropriate for the weak-doping regime ch ≪1, at least when the behaviour
at low ω < t and T < t is concerned. It appears much more diﬃcult to approach analytically the
electron transport at ch > 0. An attractive proposal remains that of spinons and holons as basic
low-energy excitations , as well as related gauge theories and slave-boson approaches, which have been applied also to the calculation of optical
conductivity . Very fruitful have been recent studies of inﬁnite-dimensional
models, in particular for the Hubbard model , which allow also for the evaluation of σ(ω) and ρ(T). Since these numerical results are also
hard to interpret, it is still under debate to what extent they contain features relevant to lower
dimensions, e.g. to planar systems discussed here.
Several conclusions on the charge dynamics have been reached using the ED dealing with the
behaviour.
For a single hole in the AFM the planar optical conductivity σ(ω) and the charge stiﬀness have been
interpreted in terms of partially coherent hole motion with a substantially enhanced eﬀective mass
(at J/t < 1) and with a mid-infrared peak at ω ∼2J. Analogous results were presented for larger
doping , however with considerable ﬁnite-size eﬀects, so that their interpretation
does not appear well settled. We discuss in the following results for the charge transport in the
t−J model as obtained with the FTLM, in part already presented elsewhere .
Current response
Let us consider the real optical conductivity σ(ω), which is a tensor in general. We are dealing here
with a system without any external magnetic ﬁeld. On a square lattice the tensor is then diagonal,
so that σαα(ω) = σ(ω). Within the linear-response theory the regular part
of σ(ω > 0) is given by
σreg(ω) = e2
dteiωt⟨jα(t)jα(0)⟩,
where ⃗j is the (total) particle current operator. In a ﬁnite system one can write C(ω) in terms of
exact eigenstates |Ψn⟩with corresponding energies En,
e−βEn|⟨Ψm|jα|Ψn⟩|2δ(ω −Em + En).
It is however well known that in general one has to take into account also the singular contribution
to the charge dynamical response, i.e.
σ(ω) = 2πe2
0Dcδ(ω) + σreg(ω),
where Dc represents the charge stiﬀness. We study in the following σ(ω) in more general tightbinding models, e.g. including also the n.n.n. hopping. Since the analysis of this case, together
with the derivation of a proper Dc and the optical sum rule, is not usual in the literature we present
it shortly below.
We follow the approach by Kohn introducing a (ﬁctitious) ﬂux φ through a torus representing the square lattice with p.b.c. Such a ﬂux induces a vector potential ⃗A, being equal on all
lattice sites. In lattice models with a discrete basis for electron wavefunctions ⃗A can be introduced
with a gauge transformation (Peierls construction) c†
jsexp(−ie0 ⃗A · ⃗Rj), which eﬀectively
modiﬁes hopping matrix elements. Taking ⃗A as small we can express the modiﬁed tight-binding
Hamiltonian allowing also for more general hopping elements tij
tije−ie0 ⃗A· ⃗Rijc†
jscis + Hint ≈
H(0) + e0 ⃗A ·⃗j + e2
⃗A · τ ⃗A,
where ⃗Rij = ⃗Rj −⃗Ri, τ is the kinetic stress tensor, and
tij ⃗Rijc†
tij ⃗Rij ⊗⃗Rijc†
Note that in usual n.n. tight-binding models τ is directly related to the kinetic energy operator,
ταα = (Hkin)αα.
The electrical current ⃗je is from the equation (5.4) expressed as a sum of the particle-current
and the diamagnetic contribution,
⃗je = −∂H/∂⃗A = −e0⃗j −e2
The above analysis applies also to an oscillating ⃗A(t) = ⃗A(ω)exp(−iω+t). This induces an electric
ﬁeld in the system ⃗E(t) = −∂⃗A(t)/∂t. We are interested in the response of ⟨⃗je⟩(ω). Evaluating ⟨⃗j⟩
within the standard linear response , and with ⃗A(ω) = ⃗E(ω)/iω+, we arrive at the
complex optical conductivity
ω+N (⟨τ⟩−χ(ω)),
dteiω+t⟨[⃗j(t),⃗j(0)]⟩.
Complex ˜σ(ω) = σ(ω) + i˜σ′′(ω) satisﬁes the Kramers-Kronig relation. Since χ(ω →∞) →0, we
get from the equation (5.7) a condition for ˜σ′′(ω →∞),
σ(ω)dω = πe2
which corresponds to the optical sum rule. It reduces to the well known one for continuum electronic
systems, as well as for n.n. hopping models where ⟨ταα⟩= −⟨Hkin⟩/d . We can
now make contact with the deﬁnition (5.3). From the expression (5.7) it follows
2N [⟨ταα⟩−χ′
Charge stiﬀness
Nonzero charge stiﬀness D0
c = Dc(T = 0) > 0 is a characteristic signature of a metallic state , in contrast to an insulator with D0
c = 0. The evaluation of D0
been recently applied to a number of correlated fermionic systems, both analytically for 1D systems
 and numerically for planar Hubbard and t-J models . At T > 0 one would expect for normal resistors Dc = 0. Since we are working with small
systems with p.b.c., where ballistic response of carriers can persist at T > 0, we ﬁnd in general
Dc(T) ̸= 0. Note however that recently a nontrivial possibility of a nonergodic behaviour in a
macroscopic limit has been realized, i.e. with Dc(T > 0) > 0, being related to the integrability of
the fermionic model .
The t-J model at half-ﬁlling has Dc(T) = 0 at any T, since charge ﬂuctuations are projected out
by construction of the model (2.6). For a doped system one expects D0
c ∝ch at low ch. Studying
the charge transport at T > 0 within the planar t −J model we adopt the view that there exist
scattering processes which in a macroscopically large systems cause Dc(T > 0) = 0, i.e. the model
is ergodic. However, in our numerical calculations we are dealing with small systems and a small
portion of the total current can propagate through the system unscattered, thereby establishing
in the system a persistent current. Hence we characterize observed Dc(T > 0) ̸= 0 as a ﬁnite-size
artifact. Nevertheless, a variation of Dc(T) brings a valuable information. At T > 0 the scattering
processes result in a ﬁnite mean-free path of charge carriers ls(T). When the linear system size L
exceeds ls, it is reasonable to expect that Dc(T) ∼0. On the other hand for L < ls(T) we obtain
c. By following Dc(T) we can thus independently monitor the transport mean free
path. Since ls is strongly T-dependent, we can approximately locate the crossover temperature as
L ∼ls(Tfs).
We can express Dc in the t-J model on a square lattice from the equation (5.9) as
4N ⟨Hkin⟩−
0+ σ(ω)dω.
Within the FTLM ⟨Hkin⟩and σ(ω) are calculated separately. It should be however mentioned that
due to ﬁnite M there could be some ambiguity in the cutoﬀemployed at low ω, the problem which
is however restricted to otherwise unproblematic T ≫t regime.
Results for a single hole in the t−(J = 0) model, as obtained by Jakliˇc and Prelovˇsek 
show that Dc(T) interpolates quite smoothly between Dc = 0 at T = ∞and D0
c, the crossover
becoming sharper in larger systems.
For the AFM case results for Dc(T) are less regular, as
presented in Fig. 5.1 for various Nh ≥1 on a system with N = 16 sites. When judging the extent
of deviations of Dc from zero at T > 0, it is useful to compare values with the maximum possible
ones, i.e. with the value of the sum rule at T = 0, Dmax = |⟨Hkin⟩(T = 0)|/4N, as follows from
the equation (5.10). We notice from Fig. 5.1 that Dc typically shows a rather abrupt transition
from Dc ∼0 to Dc ̸= 0 at the crossover temperature Tfs, depending mainly on ch. For T < Tfs
the variation Dc(T) can become quite unphysical, i.e. we get in some cases even Dc < 0. These
phenomena are inﬂuenced by particular p.b.c. and more sensible results can be obtained by the
Figure 5.1:
Normalized charge stiﬀness Dc/Dmax for various number on holes Nh in a system with
N = 16 sites.
introduction of twisted boundary conditions or ﬂuxes . Nevertheless we are here
interested only in the regime T > Tfs. It follows again that Tfs is minimum, i.e. Tfs ∼0.1 t, for
the intermediate doping 0.1 < ch < 0.3. We should stress the striking message that at intermediate
doping even at such low T, representing for cuprates T ∼450K, the mean free path does not exceed
ls ∼4 sites and this entirely due to correlation eﬀects.
Single-hole mobility
It is expected that at low doping the conductivity scales linearly with doping, hence it is meaningful
to introduce the dynamical mobility µ(ω) which is a single-hole property
σ(ω) = e0chµ(ω),
but still highly nontrivial for a Mott or an AFM insulator.
The most conclusive theoretical results (in 2D or higher D systems) have been so far obtained
for a problem of a single mobile hole introduced into a reference insulator. Brinkman and Rice
 solved the problem for J = 0 within RPA. They pointed out of an essentially incoherent hole
motion and evaluated the d.c. mobility µ0(T), exhibiting µ0 ∝T for T > t. µ(ω) within RPA shows an incoherent motion, resulting in a slow non-Drude fall-oﬀµ(ω) ∝1/ω for
larger ω. The RPA has been recently justiﬁed and applied more rigorously for inﬁnite-D lattices
 . An analogous approach is the evaluation of frequency moments of µ(ω),
starting at T ≫t, as applied to the J = 0 problem by Ohata and Kubo . On the other
hand, µ(ω) at T = 0 has been in recent years well established by numerical studies of small systems
via the ED method . Nevertheless there are important
unsolved questions even for the single-hole problem. Is µ(ω) on a planar lattice qualitatively and
quantitatively well described within the RPA, at least for T > t ? Which are new qualitative
dynamical features at T < t, both for the J = 0 and the J > 0 case ?
Results for µ(ω) at J = 0, obtained via the FTLM by Jakliˇc and Prelovˇsek , show an
overall agreement with the RPA. However, in contrast to the smooth RPA curve the actual µ(ω),
evaluated at T ≫t, seems to be nonanalytical, i.e. it shows a cusp at ω = 0. The phenomenon
seems to be characteristic for J = 0, but not for J > 0. µ(ω) for J = 0 retains its high-T form
for all T > t, but changes qualitatively for T < t. Here the central peak due to the formation of
the FM polaron starts to emerge at low ω, and the incoherent broad background
steadily vanishes on approaching T →0.
We are more interested in the AFM case, as shown in Fig. 5.2. For T > t the spin background
is disordered and the mobility retains the high-T form µ(ω) ∝β, leading to µ0 ∝1/T. As seen
from Fig. 5.2, there is a qualitative change already in the regime J < T < t. Namely, it appears
that here µ(ω) has a weaker T-dependence. For T →0 we are however approaching a nontrivial
response of an AFM polaron, which has been analyzed numerically by several authors. At T = 0
one expects in µ(ω) for ω →0 a coherent response of an AFM polaron with an enhanced mass, but
also a nonvanishing incoherent part at ω > J . The latter
component seems to have a nontrivial internal structure being related to the mid-infrared peak, as
realized also in Fig. 5.2 for the lowest T = 0.1 t.
Figure 5.2:
Dynamical mobility µ(ω) for a single hole in an AFM at various T.
From µ(ω) one can extract the d.c. mobility µ0. Results for J = 0.3 t and J = 0 are presented
in Fig. 5.3, with the RPA (J = 0) result for comparison. While for T > 2t we see the high-T result
µ0 ∝1/T for both J, we get for the AFM case a nontrivial µ0 ∼const within the regime J < T < t.
It is plausible that J > 0 reduces µ0 as follows also from the frequency-moment analysis at T ≫t
 , indicating that in an AFM the hole motion is more frustrated leading
to stronger scattering. As one can realize from Fig. 5.2, it is hard to get meaningful results for
T < J ∼Tfs, since in this regime the central QP peak is essentially undamped. This is an indication
that we are already dealing with ﬁnite-size eﬀects, as discussed in Sec. 5.2, and the mean free path
is beyond our system size ls > L. Naively one would expect from Fig. 5.3 that in the regime T < J
µ0 would increase with decreasing T, whereby the scattering of the QP (AFM polaron) should be
on thermally excited magnons. There are however unsolved problems with such a description. In
an AFM the QP dispersion is strongly renormalized
and is eﬀectively narrower than the magnon one, hence it seems hard to ﬁnd appropriate allowed
scattering processes. These questions become important when discussing the relation of calculated
µ0 to the resistivity of cuprates at low doping, as discussed in Sec. 5.5.
Figure 5.3:
D.c. mobility µ0 vs. T for J = 0 and J/t = 0.3. The RPA result is shown for
comparison.
Optical conductivity at ﬁnite doping
Even more challenging questions appear at ﬁnite hole doping. Whereas at low doping one could
treat the transport within the semiconductor-like model of independent QP - AFM polarons, this
concept fails even for a moderate ch ≳0.1 due to the overlap between extended spin deformations
around holes. Alternative indications for such a phenomenon have been already discussed in Sec. 4
in connection with ch(µh).
Since in a planar system we are evaluating the sheet conductivity σ(ω) it is convenient to discuss
at ﬁnite doping the dimensionless quantity ¯σ = σρ0, where ρ0 = ℏ/e2
0 = 4.1kΩis the universal 2D
sheet resistance. Such a quantity has an additional meaning since it makes a direct contact with
the theory of localization, where ¯σ0 ∼¯σmin is a characteristic marginal value associated with the
2D minimum metallic conductivity . The value of ¯σmin and its relevance is
however controversial, and it ranges from ¯σmin = 0.1 to ¯σmin ∼0.5 found
in experiments as a borderline between insulating and conducting cuprates
Intermediate doping
Let us go straight to results at the intermediate (optimum) doping, where we can reach lowest Tfs.
Instead of σ(ω) it is more instructive to present the current correlation function C(ω), equation
(5.1). To avoid the ambiguities with an additional smoothing, we plot the corresponding integrated
Figure 5.4:
Integrated current correlation spectra IC(ω) at ch = 3/16 for diﬀerent T ≤t.
In Fig. 5.4 we present IC(ω) for ch = 3/16, for various T ≤t. Spectra reveal several remarkable
features :
(i) For T ≤J spectra IC(ω) are essentially independent of T, at least for available T > Tfs.
(ii) Simultaneously the slope of IC(ω < 2 t) is nearly constant, i.e. we ﬁnd C(ω) ∼C0 in a wide ω
range. At the same time C0 is only weakly dependent on J as tested for J/t = 0.2 −0.6.
(iii) Even for higher T > J the diﬀerences in the slope C0, as also in IC(∞), appear as less essential.
Note that for T ≫t we know exactly IC(∞) = πt2ch(1 −ch) .
We conclude that C(ω < 2 t) ∼C0 implies a simple universal form ,
σ(ω) = C0e2
Such a σ(ω) shows a nonanalytic behaviour at ω →0, starting with a ﬁnite slope. This is already
an indication that σ(ω) is not consistent with the usual Drude form, but rather with a marginal
concept where the only ω scale is given by T. It is also remarkable that the
form (5.13) trivially reproduces the linear law ρ ∝T as well as the non-Drude fall-oﬀat ω > T. It
is evident that the expression (5.13) is universal containing the only parameter C0 as a prefactor.
Experimental results and theoretical considerations are often discussed in terms of the ωdependent relaxation time τ and the eﬀective mass m∗. These can be uniquely introduced via
the complex ˜σ(ω) and the corresponding memory function M(ω) ,
S = −⟨Hkin⟩/2N,
Figure 5.5:

and diﬀerent T. The insert in a) shows the T-dependence of 1/τ(0).
1 + M′(ω)/ω ,
where mt = 1/2ta2
0 is the bare band mass. Using relations (5.14),(5.15) one can formally rewrite
˜σ(ω) in the familiar Drude form
m∗(ω)[ω + i/τ(ω)].
Employing the equation (5.16) we evaluate both τ(ω) and m∗(ω) from known ˜σ(ω). Results for
ch = 3/16, corresponding to Fig. 5.4, are presented in Fig. 5.5.
It follows from Fig. 5.5a, but even more directly from the form (5.13), that in the regime T ≲J
and ω < t we can describe the behaviour of 1/τ with a linear law
τ −1 = 2πλ(ω + ξT),
This dependence falls within the general framework of the MFL scenario. It is however not the
form (2.3) proposed originally , but rather the
one (2.4) deduced from experiments in cuprates . It
should be however stressed that the asymptotic form (5.17) does not allow for any free parameter,
i.e. constants λ and ξ are universal and independent of any model parameters, whereas within the
MFL proposal λ is an adjustable parameter while ξ = π.
It should be also mentioned that the universal dynamics, as described by the equation (5.13),
does not seem to be restricted only to the particular case of doped AFM, but has a wider applicability, e.g. it has been recently established also in ladder systems are in all aspects very similar to the ch = 3/16 case. We show in Figs. 5.6 analogous
IC(ω) for underdoped ch = 2/18, as well as for overdoped ch = 7/16. One feature common to all
ch considered (including Nh = 1) is the non-Drude behaviour for ω > t. This conﬁrms the belief
that the incoherent motion of holes, dominating the high-ω response as described e.g. within the
RPA , can remain a valid concept even at large doping ch < 0.5.
Figure 5.6:
IC(ω) for (a) ch = 2/18, and (b) ch = 7/16, for diﬀerent T.
Otherwise it is harder to make conclusions on the most interesting low-(ω, T) regime, both for
the underdoped as well as for the overdoped case. For ch = 2/18 we note that in contrast to Fig. 5.4
the low-ω slope is not constant at T < J but is still gradually decreasing with T. This results in
a modiﬁed variation of the d.c. conductivity σ0 ∝1/T 1−η with η > 0, hence also in a sublinear
ρ0 ∝T 1−η. On the other hand we see already for T = 0.1 t a drop of IC(∞) (closely related to
the sum rule) which can be interpreted with a signiﬁcant persistent (nonscattered) current in a
system with p.b.c. The latter emerges as the coherent part with Dc > 0 according to the equation
(5.3), not taken into account in the presented IC(ω). While we cannot say much on the current
relaxation of such a coherent part, it is plausible that an increase in the coherence should decrease
the resistivity ρ0, as found in underdoped cuprates below the crossover T ∗. Otherwise results in
Fig. 5.6a are close to curves for a single hole in an AFM, Fig. 5.2, with the diﬀerence that in the
latter case T ∗appears even higher.
In the overdoped case in Fig. 5.6b IC(∞) starts to deviate from a constant already for T ≲J.
At T < J a sharp increase of an unscattered current appears, so we are unable to speculate on a
possible onset of more LFL-like ρ ∝T 2.
Eﬀects of the next-nearest-neighbour hopping
It is a relevant question whether the anomalous but universal behaviour of σ(ω) found at the intermediate doping is spoiled by possible additional terms, e.g. by the introduction of the n.n.n.
hopping t′ term (2.7), invoked often to obtain a realistic description of cuprates. When considering
the eﬀect of t′ it is important to realize that at ﬁnite doping t′ > 0 tends to stabilize the AFM ordering while t′ < 0 destabilizes it and tends toward a Nagaoka-type FM state (Bonˇca and Prelovˇsek
Results for IC(ω) at t′ ̸= 0 are presented in Fig. 5.7. We choose rather modest |t′/t| = 0.2, still
quite a pronounced eﬀect on IC(∞) is evident. We should note that in this case also generalized
sum rules, following equations (5.5) and (5.8), apply. On the other hand, the low-ω part is not
changed essentially. For t′/t = 0.2 we note again an universal behaviour according to the form
(5.13). Deviations at lowest T are somewhat larger for t′/t = −0.2. A possible interpretation of
these results is that t′ ̸= 0 moves the system eﬀectively away from the starting doping regime, i.e.
drives an optimum system either towards the underdoped or to the overdoped regime.
Figure 5.7:
IC(ω) for ch = 3/18 and the n.n.n. hopping: a) t′/t = 0.2, and b) t′/t = −0.2, for
diﬀerent T.
Resistivity
Finally, we display results for the d.c. resistivities ρ(T), as extracted from σ(ω →0). The extrapolation ω →0 is straightforward at higher T. It becomes somewhat more delicate on approaching
T ∼Tfs due to the appearance of more pronounced structures and Dc ̸= 0. Actually, we can
evaluate σ0 either from σ(ω) which involves some smoothing, or from the slope of IC(ω ∼0) which
seems to be more reliable.
In Fig. 5.8 we present results for ρ(T) at various ch for J/t =
0.3, and in comparison also
for J = 0. We ﬁrst notice that at T > t calculated ρ(T) ∝T. The slope at T > t is nearly
independent of J, the main eﬀect of ﬁnite J > 0 being the upward shift of ρ(T) curves. The shift
also decreases as doping is increased, since it is plausible that the eﬀect of J nearly vanishes in
the overdoped regime ch > 0.3. The slope at T > t can be approximately given (for ch < 0.25) as
dρ/dT ∼ζρ0kB/cht with ζ ∼0.4. This value conﬁrms the relevance ot the RPA , which yields for a square lattice ζ ∼0.72.
Figure 5.8:
Resistivity ρ vs. T at diﬀerent ch = Nh/N for J = 0.3 t (full lines) and J = 0 (dashed
One could expect essential changes in the regime T ≲J. It is evident from Fig. 5.8 that at the
intermediate doping 0.15 < ch ≲0.25 the curve ρ(T) changes the slope at T ∼J. Nevertheless
ρ(T < J) is still linear in T, as emerges also from the observed universal form (5.13). As discussed
in Sec. 5.4.2, the underdoped systems as ch = 2/16 show already deviations from the universality
(5.13). Two eﬀects should be mentioned. In the regime where our analysis is fully applicable and
ls < L we ﬁnd sublinear ρ(T) ∝T 1−η, which could be interpreted also as ρ(T) ∼A + BT with a
positive intercept A > 0. On the other hand, the appearance of Dc ̸= 0 in our results seems to be
closely related to another scale T ∼T ∗where a kink of ρ(T) appears. It should be also noted that
the introduction of the n.n.n. hopping t′ ̸= 0 does not change qualitative conclusions.
Relation to experiments
In 2D σ is naturally expressed in terms of the universal constant ρ0 = ℏ/e2
0. The corresponding
3D conductivity of a stack of 2D conducting sheets with an average distance ¯c is given instead
by σ3D = σ/¯c. For comparison with experiments we reduce the 3D measured values to the 2D
conductivities for three diﬀerent cuprates at intermediate doping, i.e. LSCO with x = 0.2 , Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (BISCCO) , and YBCO .
Experimental results are taken at relatively low temperatures T < 200 K, i.e. at T < Tfs below the
sensitivity of our small-system calculations. It is an open experimental question whether spectra
reduced in this way are really universal, i.e. whether they depend only on the hole concentration
ch in conducting CuO2 layers or other details of material structure are still important. Moreover,
eﬀective ch for presented materials are known only approximately, except for LSCO where ch ∼x,
i.e. it is estimated that ch ∼0.23 for BISCCO and YBCO .
Taking into account this uncertainty calculated spectra σ(ω) for ch = 3/16 are in a quantitative
agreement with measurements, as seen in Fig. 5.9, where the energies are expressed in eV using
t = 0.4 eV. We note also that at high ω ≳1 eV the fall-oﬀof calculated σ(ω) is faster than that
of measured ones. This could be explained by the emerging contribution of transitions to excited
(charge transfer or upper Hubbard band) states not taken into account within the t−J model, but
clearly identiﬁed experimentally .

Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8
Figure 5.9:
Sheet conductivities σ(ω) for various T/t, in comparison with measurements in diﬀerent
cuprates. Experimental results refer to T < 200 K.
It should be noted that also calculated τ −1(ω) and corresponding parameters λ and ξ, as deﬁned
by the equation (5.17) are close to the experimental ones. E.g., an analysis in a wide frequency
range ω < 1000 cm−1 presented for YBCO and BISCCO data by El Azrak et al. yields
λ ∼0.11, while a broader class of optimally doped materials is consistent with 0.1 < λ < 0.15
 . A recent investigation in a narrower ω range obtains
for an overdoped LSCO (x = 0.22) similar values 0.06 < λ < 0.08.
Also m∗/mt in Fig. 5.5b qualitatively agrees with experimental ﬁndings . For a quantitative comparison
we should note that by lowering T to experimentally investigated values we expect the increase of
m∗at low ω. On the other hand, assuming realistic values a0 = 0.38 nm and t = 0.4 eV we should
also take into account that mt ∼0.6 m0.
In Fig. 5.10 we compare calculated resistivities to the measured ones. It should be pointed out
that there is a restricted T window where a comparison could be made since Tfs ∼450K, whereby
at T ∼Tfs also ﬁnite-size eﬀects start to inﬂuence our analysis. Nevertheless, for the intermediate
doping ch ∼0.2 our ρ(T) results match quantitatively well experimental ones for cuprates with
comparable hole concentrations, i.e. for BISCCO, YBCO and LSCO with x = 0.15 .
Turning to underdoped materials, there are certain features which are reproduced in our results.
First, our µ(ω) for a single hole, see Fig. 5.2, as well as several T = 0 numerical studies indicate an existence of a mid-infrared peak in σ(ω), being a
signature of magnon excitations in a spin background with a longer range AFM order. This feature
has been seen in experiments in LSCO , although its appearance in other
materials is controversial. We also reproduce the observation that at moderate doping ch > 0.1 the
Figure 5.10:
Sheet resistivities ρ(T) for various dopings (full lines) in comparison with measurements in LSCO with x = 0.15 (dotted), BISCCO (dashed), and YBCO (dash-dotted).
resistivity essentially scales as ρ ∝1/ch. An unproportional increase of ρ at low doping ch < 0.1,
as deduced when comparing values in Fig. 5.10 with single-hole mobilities in Fig. 5.3, is as well
consistent with experiments, e.g. for LSCO with x < 0.1 .
Magnetic Properties
The static spin response and the spin dynamics in the undoped and doped AFM state in cuprates
have been experimentally studied by the neutron scattering , by NMR
techniques , as well by other methods.
Magnetic excitations in cuprates as measured by the neutron scattering reveal in insulating
materials La2CuO4 and YBa2Cu3O6 a remarkable agreement with the magnons within the planar Heisenberg AFM. On
the other hand, a consistent description of magnetic properties of doped cuprates is still lacking.
Nevertheless it is quite clear that the normal-state spin dynamics diﬀers qualitatively from the one
expected for LFL. In doped LSCO NMR and NQR spin-lattice relaxation time T1 on Cu nuclei
is generically nearly T and doping independent in the normal state (T > Tc) ,
in contrast to the Korringa law 1/T1 ∝T in normal metals. Also, in the same regime the low-ω
dynamical susceptibility in doped systems appears to be consistent with χ′′(ω) ∝ω/T . Experimental investigations in recent years have
been focused on underdoped materials, which show in the normal phase the emerging spin gap
both in the NMR and in the neutron scattering , but also the
appearance of charge stripes related to AFM domains . Since the latter
phenomena appear only at lower T, hardly accessible in our studies, we shall comment them only
brieﬂy lateron.
Well understood theoretically is so far the isotropic quantum AFM, with the long-range order at
T = 0 . For doped systems several phenomenological explanations (see Sec. 2.2)
have been presented for magnetic properties. NMR and NQR data on the spin dynamics have been
interpreted within the NAFL scenario , where the T
dependence is attributed to the variation of the AFM correlation length ξ(T). At low hole doping
the mapping on the quantum critical scaling regime of the nonlinear sigma model, with the main
ingredient ξ ∝1/T, has been advocated by Sokol and Pines . An alternative scenario for the
low-(ω, T) behaviour is the MFL scenario , where
ξ(T) is short and not crucially T-dependent.
Most reliable model results for magnetic properties of doped AFM have been obtained for static
quantities by QMC studies of the Hubbard model and by the g.s. ED of the t-J model , as well as by means of the HTE analysis . Much less conclusive
are results for the spin dynamics.
While g.s.
ED studies of the spin structure factor S(⃗q, ω)
 reveal quite an essential diﬀerence between S(⃗q, ω) and
corresponding charge spectra N(⃗q, ω), they cannot give reliable conclusions for the low-ω behaviour.
There have been only few attempts to address numerically dynamical properties at T > 0 , prior to the application of the FTLM . It should be
reminded that most challenging questions (related to the normal state) refer to the dynamics at
low ω and to the d.c. spin response in the strong correlation regime J < t at low T < J.
Spin response
We consider the response of the electronic system to the time-dependent, spatially modulated
magnetic ﬁeld, which couples to the spin degrees of freedom via a Zeeman term
ei⃗q· ⃗RiSz
Within the linear response theory the magnetization response is given by
⃗q ⟩(ω) = g2µ2
Bχ(⃗q, ω)B⃗q(ω),

S(⃗q, ω) is the quantity directly evaluated within the FTLM, following the expression (3.42). Consequently the static structure factor and the static susceptibility can be evaluated,
S(⃗q, ω)dω = ⟨Sz
χ′(⃗q, 0) = 1
χ′′(⃗q, ω)
Figure 6.1:
Uniform susceptibility χ0 vs. T at several ch in steps of 0.05 within a system of N = 20
sites. ch = 0 is obtained for N = 26.
Uniform spin susceptibility and Wilson ratio
The uniform case ⃗q = 0 is particular, since Stot
is a conserved quantity. Then one can use for the
uniform static spin-susceptibility χ0 the expression
χ0 = χ(⃗q = 0) = βS(⃗q = 0) = ⟨(Stot
The calculation reduces to the one involving only a thermodynamic average of a conserved operator,
and an analysis analogous to the one used in Sec. 4 applies. This simpliﬁcation allows for the
consideration of larger systems, i.e. we calculate χ0(T) for a system of N = 20 sites in the range
0 < ch < 0.3, while for the undoped AFM (Heisenberg model) we reach N = 26 .
Results at several ch are presented in Fig. 6.1. For ch = 0 our results agree with the HTE down to T ∼0.3 J. In an AFM χ0 exhibits a maximum at T = T ∗∼J, which
reﬂects the onset of the short range AFM order for T < T ∗. Namely, at T →0 the longitudinal
spin ﬂuctuations in an ordered AFM gradually freeze out, while transverse ones remain constant,
thus leading to a reduced χ0(T →0).
For a ﬁnite doping χ0 is only weakly diminished for T > J, the reduction being due to a reduced
number of spins in the system. On the other hand, the qualitative change appears for T < J. The
maximum T ∗gradually shifts to lower T with doping and ﬁnally disappears at ch > 0.15. In the
overdoped regime ch ≳0.15 we observe a monotonous Pauli-like χ0 for T < 0.2 t, which could
signify an onset of a low-T behaviour consistent with the LFL picture. Still up to ch > 0.6 we do
not ﬁnd the usual LFL behaviour χ0(T) = const, but rather χ(T) still increases nearly linearly on
lowering T →0.
Obtained results are quite consistent with experiments on cuprates. First, χ0 at T →0 increases
with doping as found in LSCO and the existence of a
Figure 6.2: Wilson ratio RW vs. T at several ch.
maximum of χ0(T) at T ∗(ch) in underdoped cuprates has been interpreted in terms of a pseudogap
scale . It is evident from our results that such a pseudogap is inherent within
the t-J model and is intimately related to the short range AFM order. It is remarkable that in
the model this feature disappears, i.e. T ∗→0, just at a similar (optimum) doping ch ∼0.15 as
in cuprates . Note also that the unusual linear increase of χ0(T →0) in the
overdoped regime, see Fig. 6.1 for ch = 0.2, seems to be well consistent with experimental results
in overdoped LSCO .
Here we can also comment on the ratio W = (g2µ2
Bχ0)/γ where γ = CV /T. It is used as a test
for the concept of nearly free QP, where one expects W0 = 1
3(πkB/µB)2. The meaningful measure
is thus the Wilson ratio RW = W/W0 being often studied in correlated systems, in particular in
connection with heavy-fermion metals. In our case it is convenient to perform the test on s directly
by deﬁning ˜γ = s/T . In our notation the dimensionless Wilson ratio
can be expressed as
(kBT/t)(χ0t)
We can now easily evaluate RW by comparing results in Fig. 4.3a with Fig. 6.1 and results are
shown in Fig. 6.2. It is quite striking that in the intermediate regime 0.1 ≲ch ≲0.2 at low T ≪J
we ﬁnd values, very close to the free fermion one, i.e. RW = 1. In the overdoped regime calculated
values are somewhat larger, but still RW < 2. The same seems to be the case for the underdoped
case ch = 0.05, where results at lowest T should be taken with care. With increasing T also RW is
increasing and seems to reach quite a wide plateau for T ≳J with RW ∼2.
This ﬁnding is quite puzzling since clearly doped AFM are far from a simple LFL, and apparently
even further from free fermions. Note however that experimental results also yield RW ∼1, both
for LSCO and YBCO . Moreover, the same experiments indicate that s ∝Tχ0
in a wide range of T and doping, so RW as deﬁned in the equation (6.7) is nearly T independent.
Figure 6.3:
Spin structure factor S( ⃗Q, ω) at ﬁxed T = 0.2 t < J and diﬀerent dopings ch.
Spin structure factor and dynamical susceptibility
Let us ﬁrst discuss S( ⃗Q, ω) spectra at the AFM wavevector ⃗Q = (π, π), where the spin response
is most pronounced. In Fig. 6.3 we present results at ﬁxed T = 0.2 t < J, but various dopings
ch . It should be noted that S( ⃗Q, ω) is not symmetric around ω = 0,
hence a maximum appears in general at ω > 0. The most interesting feature in Fig. 6.3 is the
qualitative change of spectra on doping. At low doping ch < 0.12 we see that S( ⃗Q, ω) is dominated
by a single central peak, i.e. we are observing mainly the AFM spin ﬂuctuations of a Heisenberg
model. The main eﬀect of holes is to reduce the AFM correlation length, and consequently the
intensity of the central peak.
In the intermediate regime 0.12 < ch < 0.3 a high-frequency component with ω ≳t emerges,
coexisting with the remaining low-ω ﬂuctuations.
It is quite plausible to attribute the high-ω
dynamics to the free-fermion-like component of the correlated system, in particular since it appears
to be quite independent of J (provided that J < t). Although this observation is consistent with
previous studies , the coexistence of spin-ﬂuctuation and
free-fermion timescales at the intermediate doping has been clearly established only by using the
FTLM . Namely, it is harder for other methods, e.g. within the HTE
method, to resolve coexisting diﬀerent timescales. The dual character is a crucial property, since
the free-fermion part determines to large extent static spin correlations S(⃗q) through the relation
(6.5), as well as the electron (charge) density correlations N(⃗q), discussed in Sec. 8.1. The latter
have been in fact interpreted in terms of a quasi FS . On the other hand the
low-ω spin dynamics dominates dynamical and static spin susceptibilities, i.e. χ′′(⃗q, ω)/ω and χ(⃗q),
hence the low-ω neutron scattering and NMR processes. It is also evident that in the overdoped
regime ch > 0.3 the low-frequency component is disappearing and the free-fermion-like ﬂuctuations
tend to exhaust the spectra. S( ⃗Q, ω) is nevertheless quite distinct from the one for free fermions,
even at ch ∼0.5.
Before we present results for general ⃗q ̸= ⃗Q, let us discuss the AFM correlation length ξ(T).
One can evaluate ξ(T) from the static real space correlations S(⃗r), corresponding to S(⃗q), i.e.
|⃗ri|2 exp(i ⃗Q · ⃗ri)S(⃗ri).
In the most interesting regime ch = 0.1 −0.3 we ﬁnd that ξ is short, typically ξ ∼1, governed by
correlations at ri = 1. It increases less than 30% between T = J and T = J/3. This ﬁnding is well in agreement with the HTE studies , with
the QMC results for the Hubbard model as well as with values ξ(T = 0)
obtained via the ED within the t −J model . Similar values for ξ can be extracted
also considering our results for static χ(⃗q), although results are less conclusive at low T ∼Tfs.
In recent years experiments in cuprates have shown the possibility of longer range (or even
long range) spin correlations with ⃗q ̸= ⃗Q . This has
been related either to an incommensurate spin order or to the appearance of charge stripes. Such
structures are well possible within the t-J model although it is controversial whether they are stable in the most interesting regime J ≪t.
Nevertheless we do not expect to resolve them in our calculations for J/t = 0.3, since they could
possibly appear only for T < Tfs and could be also missed due to particular clusters which do not
prefer expected orderings.
Let us turn to dynamical susceptibilities. Fig. 6.4 displays χ′′(⃗q, ω)/ω for ﬁxed ch = 3/16, but
various T and nonequivalent ⃗q. Note that on a 4 × 4 lattice ⃗q = (0, π) and ⃗q = (π/2, π/2) are
equivalent. In contrast to Fig. 6.3, high-ω features are now suppressed. Also, the free-fermion-like
component is well separated from the low-ω part only for ⃗q ∼⃗Q, where one expects a gap in the
response of free fermions with a well deﬁned FS. For other ⃗q the free-fermion contribution persists
at larger ω > J in the form of a long tail, while in the low-ω regime it merges with the spin
contribution.
The most striking feature of Fig. 6.4 is the strong T dependence of the low-ω spectra, whereas
the AFM correlation length ξ has been found to be only weakly T dependent. This conclusion on
χ′′(⃗q, ω)/ω seems to hold within the correlation regime |⃗q −⃗Q| < ξ−1, where also χ(⃗q) ∼χ( ⃗Q). The
relevant volume in the ⃗q space clearly increases on doping and exhausts for ch = 3/16 already the
substantial part of the Brillouin zone. The variation at low ω appears to follow,
χ′′(⃗q, ω)/ω ∝1/T,
ω < T < J,
or equivalently, from the relation (6.4) S(⃗q, ω) is nearly T and ω independent in the same regime.
On the other hand, at the same doping scaling does not hold for ⃗q outside the correlation volume,
e.g. for ⃗q = (0, π/2) in Fig. 6.4, where χ′′(⃗q, ω)/ω is approximately T independent as expected
within the LFL.
Spectra discussed above have as a direct consequence the T variation of the static χ(⃗q) for
T < J. We observe a pronounced T dependence, e.g. χ(⃗q) ∝1/T in a wide regime J/3 < T < t
for all q within the correlation regime. It should be however noted that we are quite restricted in
the range of T/J, so that more quantitative conclusions on a possible power-law (or logarithmic)
variation with T are not feasible.

Local spin dynamics
In order to describe properly the spin correlation function S(⃗q, ω) it is very helpful to consider the
local spin correlation function SL(ω) and its symmetric part ¯S(ω) ,
SL(ω) + SL(−ω) = (1 + e−βω)SL(ω).
It should be noted that SL(ω) and the related susceptibility χL(ω) have been directly measured in
cuprates by the neutron scattering , while the NMR relaxation on 63Cu eﬀectively
yields the information on SL(ω →0), as discussed in Sec. 6.5. An important restriction on ¯S(ω) is
the sum rule following from the equation (6.5),
¯S(ω)dω = ⟨(Sz
When we perform the calculation of ¯S(ω) we omit the singular ⃗q = 0 term in the summation (6.10),
so the sum rule (6.11) serves as an useful test. In Fig. 6.5 we display ¯S(ω) for diﬀerent dopings
ch = 1/20 and 3/16, and several T in the range 0.1 ≤T/t ≤0.7 . It is
immediately evident that ¯S(ω) at the optimum doping ch = 3/16 is essentially T independent in a
wide T range, although one crosses the exchange-energy scale T ∼J.
Figure 6.5:
Local spin correlation function ¯S(ω) for ch = 1/20 and ch = 3/16, and diﬀerent T.
For the underdoped case ch = 1/20 as well as for the undoped AFM the behaviour is analogous
for higher T > T0 ∼0.7 J. Deviations appear at T < T0, leading at T →0 to a decrease and to a
ﬂattening of ¯S(ω < 2J) ∼const, whereby a weak enhancement of ¯S(ω > 2J) is then required by the
sum rule. At least this regime of essentially pure Heisenberg model is well understood theoretically.
The behaviour at T > T0 is consistent with the quantum critical regime within the AFM, whereas
for T < T0 the renormalized classical regime applies . In the latter regime
we are dealing with longer range AFM correlations ξ ≫1, hence ¯S(ω) is essentially that of an
ordered AFM where the simple magnon picture leads in 2D to ¯S(ω < 2J) ∼const.
In Fig. 6.6 we follow the doping dependence of ¯S(ω) at ﬁxed T = 0.2 t < J. For convenience
we plot again the integrated spectra, in analogy to the equation (5.12),
¯S(ω′)dω′.
For chosen T results are again most reliable at the intermediate doping. The most striking message
is that the initial slope of IS(ω) and consequently SL(ω →0) is nearly doping independent for
0 ≤ch ≤0.25, as well as T independent at the intermediate doping. Only in the overdoped systems
with ch > 0.25 the low-ω behaviour changes qualitatively, where the low-ω contribution is strongly
suppressed as expected in a (more) normal FL. In a pure Heisenberg model the spin dynamics is
nearly exhausted in the range ω < 3J with excitations being magnons. On the other hand, at
the intermediate doping ¯S(ω) decreases smoothly up to ω ∼4t, this being a consequence of the
free-fermion-like component. Still up to ch ∼0.3 the dominant scale of spin ﬂuctuations remains
related to J.
Using equations (6.4) and (6.10) we ﬁnally note that the T-independent ¯S(ω) leads to the
universal form
where the T dependence is only in the thermodynamic prefactor. It follows from the equation
Figure 6.6:
Integrated spin correlation spectra IS(ω) at ﬁxed T = 0.2 t and diﬀerent ch = Nh/N.
(6.13) that for T < J the only relevant scale for χ′′
L(ω) is given by T. The same should hold for
the response at ﬁxed ⃗q. So one can generalize the expression (6.13) to
χ′′(⃗q, ω) ∼χ(⃗q)
L(ω) ∼2π ln−1(ξqm)
|⃗q −⃗Q|2 + ξ−2 χ′′
where the cutoﬀqm ∼π. The scaling is expected to be valid at least for |⃗q −⃗Q| < ξ−1. Since
ξ(T) remains weakly T dependent on decreasing T, this introduces an additional T variation in
the expression (6.14). Far from the regime ⃗q ∼⃗Q, in particular for q ∼0, the response is more
free-fermion like, i.e. χ′′(⃗q, ω) is T independent, as seen in Fig. 6.4 for ⃗q = (π/2, 0).
Nuclear magnetic relaxation
For experimental studies of static and dynamical spin correlations the NMR and the NQR relaxation
are among the most valuable tools. The hyperﬁne coupling of electronic spins to 63Cu and 17O
nuclear spins ⃗I within the CuO plane has been established by a number of authors ,
He−n = ⃗I ·
A(⃗q)⃗S⃗q.
Form factors are determined by the relative position of electronic spins (assumed to be centered on
Cu sites) and nuclear spins,
A + 2B(cos qxa + cos qya),
2C cos(qαa/2),
where α = x, y refer to Cu-O-Cu axis orientation, and A, B, C are the hyperﬁne couplings. A is
the direct hyperﬁne tensor, coupling the electronic and the nuclear spin on the same Cu site, with
components A⊥and A∥, corresponding to spins oriented perpendicular and parallel to the CuO2
plane, respectively.
The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation is due to the coupling (6.15), directly related to the low-ω
electronic spin ﬂuctuations. Let us consider only the magnetic ﬁeld directed perpendicular to the
CuO2 plane. Then the NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate is given by ,
|A⊥(⃗q)|2S(⃗q, ω0),
where ω0 is the precession frequency of the nuclear spin in the magnetic ﬁeld, and ζ = 1. Since
ω0 ≪T, one can express result as well with the dynamical susceptibility S(⃗q, ω) ≈Tχ′′(⃗q, ω0)/ω0.
The NQR relaxation rate 1/T1 is given also by the expression (6.17), but with ζ = 4 . Form factors (6.16) diﬀer essentially for O and Cu sites. Due to AFM ﬂuctuations
spin ﬂuctuations are at maximum around ⃗q = ⃗Q, as in the equation (6.14). The weight of this region
enhances 1/T1 for 63Cu, while suppressing it for 17O. This is the most important point explaining
the observation of very diﬀerent relaxation rates on diﬀerent nuclei.
In the evaluation of 1/T1 within a ﬁnite system we again omit the ⃗q = 0 term since χ′′(⃗q, ω)/ω is
ill deﬁned for ω →0 due to conserved total Sz. A proper treatment would require a more detailed
spin-diﬀusion contribution at q ∼0 which however seems to be less important, at least for the
undoped system . To allow a direct comparison with experiments we choose
hyperﬁne-coupling parameters as proposed in the literature .
Results for 63Cu NQR relaxation rate 1/T1 are presented in Fig. 6.7 . For the undoped case our results agree with Sokol et al. . It is remarkable that
1/T1 appears to be nearly T independent for a broad range of hole concentrations 0.06 < ch ≤0.3.
Only for overdoped systems with ch > 0.5 the behaviour at T < t approaches that of a normal LFL
with 1/T1 ∝T. Since the 63Cu form factor is maximum (but slowly varying with ⃗q) near AFM ⃗Q,
we get approximately 1/T1 ∝SL(ω0 ∼0). Previously established universality of SL(ω) naturally
explains nearly T independent 1/T1, which is moreover also weakly dependent on ch for ch < 0.15.
Results as shown in Fig. 6.7 are in agreement, even quantitatively without any ﬁtting parameters, with remarkable NQR experiments on doped LSCO , which reveal nearly Tand x-independent 1/T1 at T > 300 K and x < 0.15. In contrast to experiments our results show
some variation of 1/T1 with ch in this doping range. For the optimum doping lower rates 1/T1 are
anyhow expected, consistent with the data for YBCO ,
where for T > Tc the rate 1/T1 is again only weakly T dependent.
Essentially diﬀerent T dependence of 1/T1 on Cu and O nuclei has been used as an evidence for
the importance of strong AFM correlations and for the non-LFL behaviour in doped cuprates. To
evaluate the NMR relaxation rate 1/T1 for 17O we can use again the expression (6.17) with proper
form factors (6.16), projecting out the AFM ﬂuctuations at ⃗q ∼⃗Q. The omitted q ∼0 contribution
introduces in this case a larger uncertainty. Nevertheless, for ch = 1/16 and ch = 2/16 we recover
results very well described with the Korringa behaviour, i.e. 1/T1 ∼wT, as seen in Fig. 6.8 for
Tfs < T < J. In particular for ch = 2/16 we get w ∼0.3(sK)−1, very close to the actual value
w ∼0.35(sK)−1 reported for YBCO . For ch ≥3/16
deviations from the Korringa law become more pronounced due to very short ξ ∼1.
The Gaussian component of the spin-spin relaxation rate 1/T2 for 63Cu nuclei can be on the

other hand related to static spin susceptibilities ,
∥(⃗q)χ2(⃗q) −
∥(⃗q)χ(⃗q)
The ratio R = T1T/T2 for 63Cu nuclei relaxation, which is approximately T independent in cuprates,
has been interpreted as the evidence for the quantum critical behaviour of the eﬀective spin system
 . We ﬁnd quite analogous T variation of R 
using calculated χ(⃗q, ω) and equations (6.17), (6.18), together with the standard parameters . The origin of R(T) ∼const is however considerably diﬀerent from the quantum
critical scenario, since the anomalous T2(T) dependence can be related to the T dependence of
static χ(⃗q) which does not seem to be connected in an evident way with the variation of ξ(T).
Results indicate stronger doping dependence, even at low doping. Quantitatively, obtained values
are in reasonable agreement with the experimental ones, e.g. R ∼1700 K at T = 300 K for YBCO
(ch ∼0.23), while R ∼2400 K for YBa2Cu3O6.63 .
Neutron scattering
The standard neutron scattering using the thermalized neutrons from the reactor is restricted to
investigations in the energy regime ω < 40 meV. For cuprates this means only the low-energy part
of the spin dynamics with ω < J. There have been several measurements, probing the local SL(ω)
by measuring S(⃗q, ω) integrated over ⃗q ∼⃗Q . To compare with our results one
can simplify the relevant expression (6.13) by ¯S(ω) ∼¯S0. Such a form has indeed been used to
describe experiments . In this connection we should
take into account that we are not able to establish in our model calculations (the main reason
being too high Tfs) the existence of the pseudogap ωg ∼0.1 J, observed in cuprates at low T ≳Tc
 and invoked in the detailed form of SL(ω) used
in describing neutron scattering experiments.
The introduction of spallation neutron sources has expanded crucially the accessible energy
range of the spin dynamics to ω < 1eV. This gives a possibility to measure the whole relevant
range of the spin dynamics in cuprates, results being available for undoped La2CuO4 and SC
LSCO with x = 0.14 . Data for the undoped material are well described with
the standard magnon excitations in an ordered AFM, so more challenging are results for the doped
material. Since the authors present the calibrated local χ′′
L(ω) up to ω ∼0.25 eV, we can compare
data quantitatively with our results e.g. for ch = 3/16, as shown in Fig. 6.9. For the latter case
measurements were performed at T = 17 K≪J, so we present in Fig. 6.9 the T →0 limit of our
result following equation (6.13) χ′′
L(ω > T) ∼¯S(ω)/π. We observe that the agreement is quite
satisfactory (note that we use both units in eV assuming again t = 0.4 eV) for ω > 40 meV. There
is however an additional peak at ω ∼20 meV, which does not appear in our analysis. This feature
can be interpreted as a low-T phenomenon related to the onset of longer range incommensurate
spin order found in the same material , clearly beyond the reach of our method.
Orbital diamagnetism
In comparison with the spin response discussed in previous subsections, the diamagnetic contribution χd to the d.c. susceptibility has been much less investigated, both experimentally and theoretically . A diamagnetic response
Im χL(ω) (eV
Figure 6.9:
Local susceptibility χ′′
L(ω) as calculated for ch = 3/16 and T →0, compared with the
neutron scattering result for LSCO with x = 0.14 .
emerges from the orbital motion of mobile carriers. For independent electrons it corresponds to
the Landau diamagnetism, which is essentially T independent. For strongly correlated electrons
such a behaviour is far from evident. Moreover, Rojo et al. have shown a relation of the
oﬀ-diagonal Hall conductivity in an external homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B (perpendicular to the
plane) to the orbital diamagnetic susceptibility
σxy = B ∂χd
Since the Hall eﬀect is known to be anomalous in cuprates, in particular its T dependence , one could speculate on similar anomalies in χd(T), however so far both experimental and
theoretical answers are lacking.
Homogeneous perpendicular ﬁeld B can be introduced into a tight binding model with a Peierls
construction analogous to the equation (5.4), tij →tijexp(iθij), where in the Landau gauge we can
θij = −e0 ⃗A(⃗Ri) · ⃗Rij,
⃗A = B(0, x, 0).
Our aim is to evaluate the d.c. orbital susceptibility χd via the free energy density F
It is nontrivial to incorporate in a small (tilted) lattice the phases (6.20) arising from B ̸= 0, being
at the same time compatible with the p.b.c. . This can be achieved only for
quantized ﬁelds B = mB0 where the smallest ﬁeld B0 = φ0/N corresponds to a unit ﬂux φ0 per
2D system. Discrete B make the calculation of χd via equation (6.21) less reliable. It is also a
general observation that properties involving ﬁnite B (also the Hall eﬀect) are much more sensitive
to ﬁnite-size eﬀects, while at the same time translational symmetry is lost due to phases (6.20)
Figure 6.10:

J/t = 0.4 (full line), and J = 0 (dashed line).
and hence computational requirements are enhanced. On the other hand, we are evaluating only a
thermodynamic quantity - free energy density F allowing for simpliﬁcations discussed in Sec. 4.
We consider here only the case of a single hole Nh = 1, doped into a magnetic insulator.
Nevertheless we expect that results remain relevant for low ch > 0.
Namely, by assuming the
independence of charge carriers (spin polarons) χd should scale linearly with the doping, i.e. χd ∝ch
at least for ch ≪1. We present in Fig. 6.10 results for χd(T)/χ∗, as obtained by the analysis of a
single hole in an AFM with J/t = 0.4 on a system with N = 20 sites. Here, χ∗= e2ta4
characteristic diamagnetic susceptibility, which can be e.g. compared with the Pauli susceptibility
of tight-binding free fermions (with constant average density of states) χP , χ∗∼4χP (m0/mt)2
 . We calculate χd(T) using the equation (6.21) and the diﬀerence between
lowest ﬁelds, B = 0 and B = B0. For comparison we present also the J = 0 case, where ﬁnite-size
results can be checked with the HTE .
The J = 0 case seems easier to study and to understand. The HTE and small systems show
a gradual transition from the high-T regime of an incoherent hopping to the low-T Nagaoka FM
state, accompanied with a monotonous increase of |χd|. At T →0 χd is expected to diverge since
within the g.s. the dependence on B is nonanalytic, i.e. δE ∝|B| following from a cyclotron
motion of a QP (FM polaron) in a ﬁnite B > 0. Still the asymptotic behaviour at low T is not
simple to establish, since low lying states (above the Nagaoka state) are not easy to describe.
The behaviour of the AFM polaron with J > 0 is more involved. At T ≫J the exchange scale
J is not important and results qualitatively follow that of J = 0. Quite remarkable is however the
vanishing of the diamagnetic χd (or even the change of its sign) which appears on lowering T < t.
This seems to follow from the fact that J > 0 diminishes and even destroys emerging coherence of
a QP. Only at lower T < J the coherence is reestablished and the standard dynamical picture of a
coherent AFM polaron is dominating the behaviour in the lowest ﬁelds. Reliable results are however
quite diﬃcult to obtain since small systems results (note that we have to follow the variation with
B) are quite sensitive to the system shape and boundary conditions due to a very anisotropic and
degenerate QP dispersion.
At low ch the relevant value of the diamagnetic susceptibility chχd is small compared to the spin
contribution , hence it is not evident that it is directly measurable . Nevertheless, the variation χd(T) is in any case very interesting in
connection with the challenging problem of the Hall eﬀect, related via the equation (6.19), and the
anomalous RH(T). Both χd as well as the Hall eﬀect emerge from a coupling to orbital currents,
which is the essence of the relation (6.19). We note that at T ≫J the HTE for the Hall constant
RH(T) is analogous to that of χd(T) discussed here. Crossing the scale T ∼J remains the challenge,
whereby it seems that at such T hole-like RH > 0 is even reduced from its high-T value . Nevertheless Hall eﬀect measurements indicate that RH > 0 recovers for
T < T ∗, varying strongly with T, and ﬁnally seems to approach the well known quasiclassical result
for T →0 .
Spectral Properties
One of the most desired quantities, giving valuable information on electronic properties in interacting systems, is the single-electron Green’s function G(⃗k, ω) and the corresponding spectral function
A(⃗k, ω). In theoretical treatments G(⃗k, ω) is usually the basis to understand two-particle properties, such as dynamical electric and magnetic response functions etc. In strongly correlated systems
it appears however that calculations as well as the measurements of spectral functions are more
delicate than that of most response functions, hence we also treat them towards the end.
Spectral functions A(⃗k, ω) are directly accessible via ARPES experiments. There has been in
recent years an impressive advance in the resolution of ARPES as well in the novel information
on cuprates, mostly obtained on convenient layered BISCCO materials . In the regime of optimum-doped and overdoped cuprates
ARPES experiments reveal for a wide class of materials a well deﬁned large FS consistent with the
Luttinger theorem and a QP dispersion close to a tight-binding band . This seems to imply the validity of the concept of a metal with an
electronic-like FS, although such a simple picture is in an apparent contradiction with anomalous
magnetic and transport properties.
The LFL interpretation is also spoiled by the overdamped
character of QP peaks. Although a large background makes ﬁts of particular lineshapes nonunique,
the QP inverse lifetime is found to be of the order of the QP energy, supporting the possibility of
the MFL scenario.
On the other hand, in underdoped materials well deﬁned QP crossing the
FS gradually lose their character and spectral functions approach a qualitatively diﬀerent regime of
an undoped AFM , where the QP dispersion is that of a spin polaron in an AFM
background. An excitement has been induced also by the leading-edge shift ,
observed by ARPES in underdoped cuprates in the normal state. It indicates that a pseudogap
consistent with the d−wave SC symmetry persists well above Tc. On the other hand recent angleintegrated PES measurement indicate another higher energy pseudogap scale
being in a closer correspondence with T ∗(ch) as deduced from χ0(T), ρ(T) and RH(T) .
It has been unclear whether above features of spectral functions could be reproduced within
generic models, such as the Hubbard and the t-J model, in particular in the most challenging regime
of the intermediate doping. A(⃗k, ω) in 2D models have been so far studied mainly via numerical
techniques , in particular using the ED and the QMC . These studies have
established a reasonable consistency of the model QP dispersions with the experimental ones, as
well as the possibility of a large FS, but have not been able to investigate closer the character of
QP, as e.g. manifested in the corresponding self energies Σ(⃗k, ω) being in the core of anomalous
low-energy properties.
Green’s function
When applying the usual deﬁnition of the retarded Green’s function to the model
of strongly correlated electrons, one should keep in mind that the t-J model (2.6) acts within the
restricted fermionic basis. To avoid the ambiguity it is convenient to build restrictions directly in
the deﬁnition of retarded Green’s functions using the projected operators ˜c†
⃗ks, ˜c⃗ks, being Fourier
transforms of ˜c†
is, ˜cis, respectively,
GR(⃗k, ω) = −i
dt eiω+t⟨{˜c⃗ks(t), ˜c†
⃗ks(0)}+⟩.
Note that within the subspace of allowed states the deﬁnition is identical to the usual one. A(⃗k, ω)
can be represented as a sum of the electron spectral function A+(⃗k, ω) and the hole spectral function
A−(⃗k, ω),
A(⃗k, ω) = −1
πImGR(⃗k, ω) = A+(⃗k, ω) + A−(⃗k, −ω),
which are expressed in terms of eigenstates as
⃗ks|Ψn⟩|2e−β(En−µNn
e )δ(ω + µ −Em + En),
A−(⃗k, −ω)
|⟨Ψm|˜c⃗ks|Ψn⟩|2e−β(En−µNn
e )δ(−ω −µ −Em + En).
A−represents the dynamical response when one electron is taken out (hole added) from a system.
It corresponds (within the sudden approximation) to PES experiments and is proportional to
corresponding cross sections in ARPES. On the other hand, A+ describes the dynamics on adding
an electron and is related to IPES experiments. In the equilibrium electron and hole spectra are
related via the Fermi function f(ω) = 1/(exp(βω) + 1), e.g. A−(⃗k, −ω) = f(ω)A(⃗k, ω).
The omission of doubly occupied states has important implications, in particular we note the
change in anticommutation relations,
⃗ks, ˜c⃗ks}+ = 1
is, ˜cis}+ = 1
(1 −ni−s).
In the paramagnetic phase where ⟨nis⟩= (1 −ch)/2, the equation (7.4) leads to a modiﬁed sum
rule for the spectral function (usually normalized to unity), i.e.
dω A(⃗k, ω) = 1
2(1 + ch) < 1.
An important consequence of the relation (7.5) is an upper bound for the momentum distribution
¯n⃗k = ⟨c†
A−(⃗k, ω)dω < α.
The anomalous sum rule (7.5) leads to some ambiguity in the deﬁnition of the self energy Σ(⃗k, ω).
We keep the usual one,
GR(⃗k, ω) = 1/(ω −Σ(⃗k, ω)),
in order to retain the standard deﬁnition of QP parameters. An alternative would be to replace
the nominator with α . The equation (7.7) implies that the self energy does not
vanish for |ω| →∞, but shows rather an asymptotic form Σ(⃗k, ω →∞) →(1 −1/α)ω. Note also
that the t-J model doesn’t allow for a free propagation even at J = 0, therefore we do not include
any free term ǫ⃗k in the deﬁnition (7.7).
It is straightforward to calculate A(⃗k, ω) using the FTLM , again
following the equation (3.42). Since operators ˜c†
⃗ks, ˜c⃗ks act between subspaces with diﬀerent Nh,
i.e. Nh →Nh ∓1, we in fact calculate separately A+ and A−according to deﬁnitions (7.3). In
calculations at low T and ﬁxed ch = Nh/N we also replace the grand-canonical average with the
canonical one in the subspace of states with Nh holes. For a proper interpretation of results it
is important to locate correctly the chemical potential µ(T, ch), discussed in Sec. 4.1. We have a
nontrivial check of µ via the one-particle DOS
A(⃗k, ε −µ),
which relates µ to ch,
N(ω + µ)(eβω + 1)−1dω = 1 −ch.
We ﬁnd a very good agreement between µ calculated from N(ε) and the one determined from
thermodynamics in Sec. 4.1.
The advantage of the FTLM over the g.s. ED is that it gives smooth GR(⃗k, ω) even for quite
low T < J provided that T > Tfs. This allows for a meaningful calculation of Σ(⃗k, ω), which gives
a new insight in the properties of QP. We are thus able to evaluate also QP parameters deﬁned via
Σ(⃗k, ω) , in particular the QP energy E⃗k, the weight Z⃗k consistent with the equation
(2.5), and the damping Γ⃗k,
Σ′(⃗k, E⃗k),
1 −∂Σ′(⃗k, ω)/∂ω|ω=E⃗k,
Z⃗k|Σ′′(⃗k, E⃗k)|.
Single hole in the antiferromagnet
We begin by considering the spectral properties of a single hole injected in an AFM. Since in the
undoped model particle-number ﬂuctuations are suppressed, the chemical potential is not a well
deﬁned quantity in this case and we use here unreduced energy ε instead of ω = ε −µ.
On the left side of Fig. 7.1 the spectral function of a hole in an AFM is presented. Although
T = J/2 is relatively high, implying only short-range AFM correlations, still a coherent QP peak
is clearly observed at low energies for most available ⃗k. For ⃗k = (π/2, π/2) and ⃗k = (2π/3, 0)
peaks coincide with the g.s. minima for systems with N = 16 and N = 18 sites, respectively.
This indicates that even at T > 0 the major contribution to the coherent spectral weight comes
from transitions between the g.s. conﬁgurations with Nh = 0 and Nh = 1. The coherent QP peak
shows a dispersion on the energy scale comparable to J, consistent with the self-consistent Born
Figure 7.1:

approximation , which yields a bandwidth W ∼0.6 t
for J/t = 0.3 . Since no long-range AFM order is expected in small
systems, the propagation of the hole appears to be determined by short-range AFM correlations. In
addition to the QP band at ε ≲ε0 ∼2t, we observe also high-energy features at ε ≪ε0, which are
only weakly dependent on ⃗k and can be attributed to the incoherent hole propagation. High-energy
peaks have been observed also in g.s. ED studies, but the structure was claimed to disappear at
large N . Our study shows a nontrivial structure consistent at all considered
N = 16 −20, so we would rather attribute peaks to resonance (excited) states of the AFM spin
In Fig. 7.2 we present the T-dependence of the spectral function at ⃗k∗= (π/2, π/2), which
corresponds to the g.s. momentum of a hole in an AFM. We realize from Fig. 7.2 that there is a
signiﬁcant spectral change going from T ∼0 to T > J. Namely, in the high-T regime the QP peak
becomes progressively broader and merges with the incoherent background, which at the same time
loses the detailed structure (resonance peaks). This development is plausible since for T > J we
are dealing essentially with the hole propagation in a random spin background well accounted for
within the RPA .
k=(π/2,π/2)
Figure 7.2:
Spectral function A(⃗k∗, ε) for the undoped AFM at several T.
At T < J the QP energy E⃗k and the corresponding weight Z⃗k , as determined by equations
(7.10), show only a weak T dependence and we get ˜Z = Z⃗k∗(T) ∼0.16. We note that this value
is obtained for the spectral function normalized according to the relation (7.5) with α = 1/2. It is
easy to see that in order to make a comparison with the usual deﬁnition of the QP weight of an
AFM polaron we should rather take Z = ˜Z/α and
our value Z ∼0.32 is consistent with the one Z ∼0.284, obtained within the self-consistent Born
approximation for J/t = 0.3.
Spectral functions at ﬁnite doping
In Figs. 7.1, 7.3 we present the gradual development of spectral functions towards the optimum
For ch ∼0.06 and ch ∼0.12 results obtained on systems with N = 16, 18 sites are
combined for Nh = 1 and Nh = 2 holes, respectively. As distinct to the undoped case, the spectra
are broadened with Lorentzians of variable width according to δ = δ0 +(δ∞−δ0) tanh2(ω/∆), with
δ∞= 0.2t, δ0 = 0.04t, and ∆= 1.0t. In this way sharper (well resolved) ω ∼0 features remain
unaﬀected, while some of ﬁnite-size structures at higher |ω| > t are smoothened out. In any case,
δ is always taken smaller than the energy widths of main spectral features.
At ﬁnite doping we observe in A(⃗k, ω) at all available ⃗k a coexistence of sharper features,
associated with coherent QP peaks, with a broad incoherent background, as already established
in ED studies . Coherent peaks disperse through
Figure 7.3:
A(⃗k, ω) for Nh = 2 holes on N = 16, 18 sites, and for Nh = 3 holes on N = 16 sites.
ω = 0 as ⃗k crosses the FS. Within the given resolution in the ⃗k space the FS appears to be large
for all ch ≳0.12, consistent with the Luttinger theorem . An analogous dispersion
is observed for the underdoped case ch ∼0.06, although the latter one requires a more careful
interpretation as given lateron.
The total QP dispersion W is broadening as ch is increasing,
qualitatively consistent with the slave boson result where W ∝cht + χJ .
Intermediate doping
We ﬁrst discuss in more detail the regime of intermediate doping , in
our lattices ch ∼0.12 and ch = 3/16 ∼0.19. In Fig. 7.4 we show Σ(⃗k, ω) evaluated for ch = 3/16
at T = 0.1 t ∼Tfs. We ﬁrst notice an asymmetry between the PES (ω < 0) and the IPES (ω > 0)
spectra at all ⃗k.
Σ′′(⃗k, ω) are small for ω > 0, as compared to ω < 0.
For ⃗k outside the FS
this implies a modest QP damping, consistent with sharp IPES peaks seen in A(⃗k, ω) in Fig. 7.3,
containing the major part of the spectral weight. Σ′(⃗k, ω) shows an analogous asymmetry, in the
Figure 7.4:

region ω > 0 resembling moderately renormalized QP. Due to the deﬁnition (7.7) the slope of Σ′ is
not zero even at |ω| ≫t.
The behaviour on the PES (ω < 0) side is very diﬀerent. For all ⃗k, −Σ′′(ω) are very large at
ω < −t, leading to overdamped QP structures. We should however distinguish two cases. For ⃗k
well outside the FS, large |Σ′′(ω < 0)| > t does not invalidate a well deﬁned QP at ω > 0, but
rather induces a weak reﬂection (shadow) of the IPES peak at ω < 0, as well seen in Fig. 7.3 for
⃗k = (π, π). On the other hand, for ⃗k inside or near the FS the variation with ω is more regular,
and can be directly related to the QP damping. Particularly remarkable feature in Fig. 7.4 is a
linear ω dependence of Σ′′(ω ≲0) for ⃗k = (π/2, 0) and ⃗k = (π/2, π/2). Meanwhile ⃗k = (0, 0), being
further away from the FS, seems to follow a diﬀerent more LFL-type behaviour. Similar general
conclusions follow also from results obtained for the lower doping ch = 2/18.
To address the latter point in more detail, we show in Fig. 7.5 the T variation of Σ′′(⃗k, ω) for
both dopings at selected ⃗k inside the FS. For ch = 3/16 the linearity of Σ′′(ω) is seen in a broad
range −2t ≲ω ≲0 at the lowest T shown. Moreover, for this optimum doping the T dependence
is close to a linear one, taking into account a small residual (ﬁnite-size) damping η0 > 0 at ω = 0.
Data can be well described by
−Σ′′(k ≲kF , ω) = η0 + γ(|ω| + ξT),
Such a dependence is consistent with one of the proposed forms (2.4) within the MFL scenario,
as well as with the conductivity relaxation 1/τ(ω) in the equation (5.17).
In contrast, the T
dependence for ch = 2/18 seems somewhat diﬀerent, and we ﬁnd −Σ′′ ∝ω only in the interval
−t ≲ω ≲−T. This would indicate the consistency with the original MFL form (2.3) , however we should be aware that in the underdoped regime ﬁnite-size eﬀects are larger
at given T.
Figure 7.5:
Σ′′(⃗k, ω) for ch = 2/18 and ch = 3/16 at diﬀerent T and selected ⃗k inside the FS.
Here we should comment on the manifestation of the FS in small fermionic systems. At T, ω ∼0
we are dealing in the evaluation of the expression (7.3) with the transition between g.s. of systems
with Nh and N ′
h = Nh ± 1 holes, respectively. Since these g.s. states have deﬁnite momenta ⃗k0,
they induce sharp QP peaks for particular ⃗k = ⃗k′
0 −⃗k0 deﬁning in this way for a small system the
FS, apparently satisfying the Luttinger theorem. At the same time the corresponding QP damping
vanishes, i.e. Σ′′(⃗k, ω ∼0) ∼0.
From Σ(⃗k, ω) we can calculate QP parameters, as deﬁned in equations (7.10).
Results for
ch ∼0.12 and ch ∼0.19 are presented by Jakliˇc and Prelovˇsek . We note that parameters
are of a limited meaning for ⃗k well inside FS due to a large damping Γ⃗k. Otherwise, E⃗k shows the
enhancement of the dispersion with ch, while Γ⃗k < E⃗k for |⃗k| > kF . To establish the relation with
the FL theory one has to evaluate QP parameters at the FS ⃗k ∼⃗kF . Of particular importance
is the renormalization factor ˜Z = Z⃗kF (T = 0). We ﬁnd that at lowest T ∼Tfs Z⃗kF (T) is still
decreasing as T is lowered, e.g. a variation (cca. 20%) is found within the interval 0.1 < T/t < 0.3.
This is not inconsistent with the MFL form ˜Z−1 ∼ln(ωc/T), although such a conclusion should be
taken with care due to narrow T interval.
Regarding the size of ˜Z at low but ﬁnite T > 0 we note, that the value of the momentum
distribution function is very close to the maximum (7.6) for all k < kF , i.e. ¯n⃗k ∼(1+ch)/2 . Taking the FS volume according to the Luttinger theorem VF S/VBZ = (1−ch)/2
and assuming that ¯n⃗k falls monotonously with k, this implies an inequality for the discontinuity ˜Z,
˜Z = δ¯n⃗kF <
One should keep in mind that a discontinuity is meaningful at T ∼0, while at T > 0 it indicates
only a gradual step. Still we ﬁnd a consistent result ˜Z = 0.28 for ch = 3/16, while for ch = 2/18
the value ˜Z = 0.35 is somewhat larger, possibly due to higher T used in calculations.
An analogous argument can be used to explain the electron-hole asymmetry of A(⃗k, ω). Holes
added to the system at k < kF , ω < 0 move in an extremely correlated system, strongly coupled to
the spin dynamics , the latter also exhibiting the anomalous MFL-type behaviour,
as given by the expression (6.13). On the other hand, states for k > kF are not fully populated,
allowing for a moderately damped motion of added electrons with ω > 0.
Let us comment here on the relevance of our results to ARPES spectra near the optimum
doping. The main observation is that for k < kF we ﬁnd the linewidth typically Γ ∼t ∼0.4 eV
well compatible with experiments at ⃗k away from the FS and at intermediate doping . Also the MFL form has been claimed to
describe better the experiments , although this point is still controversial .
Overdoped and underdoped regime
Let us turn from the intermediate doping ﬁrst to the overdoped regime. Spectra at higher doping
ch = 4/16 and ch = 5/16 are shown in Fig. 7.6. While A(⃗k, ω) at ch = 4/16 are still qualitatively
similar to the spectra at intermediate doping, at ch = 5/16 they are already showing a substantially
diﬀerent behaviour. In the latter case the incoherent background in the PES spectrum is reduced
while QP peaks for k < kF are sharpened and all of them are essentially underdamped with
Γ⃗k < E⃗k. Nevertheless, we still have Γ⃗k ∼E⃗k so it is not evident whether this is already a (more)
normal LFL.
The proper analysis of the underdoped regime is even more delicate. At ch ∼0.06 −0.12, as
presented in Figs. 7.1, 7.3, a ’shadow’ feature is clearly seen in A(⃗k, ω) for k > kF . Namely, along
with the principal peak at ω > 0 a weak bump in the ω < 0 part of the spectrum appears. In
Σ′(⃗k, ω) for k > kF this eﬀect emerges as a strong oscillation, most pronounced for ⃗k = (π, π). It
leads even to a double solution of the equation (7.10) for E⃗k , analogous to the phenomena within
the spin-bag scenario . This eﬀect is becoming less visible at larger
doping, e.g. at ch = 3/16, so its disappearance is related to the reduction of the AFM correlation
length ξ ∼1.
Let us try to make the contact with recent ARPES measurements on underdoped BISCCO
 , which show the opening of the pseudogap even for T > Tc, in particular
near the ⃗k∗∗= (π, 0) point, where the FS seems to disappear. On the other hand the QP peak
disperses through the FS along the Γ-M direction where the FS seems to be well deﬁned. If we
look closer at Fig. 7.1 for the lowest ﬁnite doping ch ∼0.06, we can recognize very similar features.
We realize that close to ⃗k∗∗, the PES part shows spectra very analogous to the undoped AFM
in Fig. 7.1, where due to the doubling of the Brillouin zone the dispersion is expected to reach
maximum at ⃗k∗= (π/2, π/2) (note however that on a 4 × 4 lattice with n.n. hopping k∗and k∗∗
are equivalent) and folds back for ⃗k outside the reduced AFM zone. E.g., in Fig. 7.1 for ch ∼0.06
we can clearly recognize PES peaks also for ⃗k = (π, π/3) and ⃗k = (π, π/2), being lower in ω than
the QP peak at ⃗k∗. Such a dispersion is also seen in ARPES. At the same time there is for both
mentioned k > k∗also a visible peak in the IPES part, which can be interpreted as a QP dispersing
through the FS. The PES and the IPES peak in this case are separated by a gap, which does not
seem to be a ﬁnite-size eﬀect, and is qualitatively consistent with the ARPES feature . It should be also noted that along the Γ-M direction the QP dispersion is closer to a
normal metallic one with much less pronounced ’shadows’ for k > kF .
Figure 7.6:
A(⃗k, ω) for ch = 4/16 and ch = 5/16.
Inﬂuence of next-nearest-neighbour hopping
It is evident from spectral functions at the intermediate doping, e.g. in Figs. 7.3, 7.6 that the
shape of the FS obtained within the t-J model is closer to a circular one than to the one found in
cuprates via ARPES experiments , where e.g. ⃗k∗∗is inside the FS. It has
been well established that such a FS topology can be reproduced by adding the n.n.n. hopping term
(2.7) with t′ < 0 . It is however still an open question whether the
modiﬁed hopping and diﬀerent FS topology are essential for the anomalous properties of cuprates.
In order to see the qualitative changes introduced by the n.n.n. hopping, we present in Fig. 7.7
A(⃗k, ω) at ﬁxed doping ch = 3/16 for two diﬀerent t′/t = −0.2 and t′/t = −0.35. It is evident
that t′ < 0 lifts the degeneracy between of the ⃗k∗and ⃗k∗∗even in the 4 × 4 lattice. Also the QP
dispersion changes and the QP peak with ⃗k∗is now at ω > 0, i.e. outside the FS, while the QP
with ⃗k∗∗moves inside the FS. The eﬀect is enhanced for larger |t′/t|. It is however important to
realize that other QP properties are not essentially changed, in particular we ﬁnd that the self
energy Σ′′(⃗k, ω) remains qualitatively similar to the case with t′ = 0.
Figure 7.7:
A(⃗k, ω) for ch = 3/16 with nonzero n.n.n. hopping: t′/t = −0.2 and t′/t = −0.35.
Density of states
Finally we present in Fig. 7.8 the doping dependence of the single-particle DOS N(ε) , as deﬁned in the equation (7.8). In a weakly doped system with ch ∼0.06, a QP
coherent peak (of width ∼2J) is seen at ω = ε −µ ≲0. Besides that, a broad background due
to well understood incoherent hole motion is dominating ω ≪0. At such low doping the electron
ω > 0 part of the DOS is weak, with the total intensity 2ch as compared to 1 −ch of the hole part.
With increasing ch the hole incoherent background does not reduce appreciably in intensity, while
the coherent dispersion near the Fermi energy widens and cannot be well distinguished in N(ε)
from the background. At the same time, the electron part of the DOS is increasing, both in the
weight and in the width. Note that oscillations which appear for ω > 0 at higher doping ch > 3/16
are essentially ﬁnite-size eﬀects. Namely we are dealing with a restricted number of ﬁnite-size ⃗k
while QP peaks are becoming quite narrow. Such eﬀects are even more pronounced in overdoped
systems with ch > 0.25, where the incoherent part is ﬁnally losing its intensity and the coherent
QP are dominating the whole ε regime. It should be also mentioned that the introduction of the
Figure 7.8:
Single-particle DOS N(ε) for diﬀerent dopings at ﬁxed T/t = 0.15. For ch ∼0.06 and
ch ∼0.12 we present joined DOS for N = 16, 18 systems with Nh = 1 and Nh = 2, respectively.
The thin vertical lines denote the chemical potential µ(T).
n.n.n. hopping t′ ̸= 0, in spite of a signiﬁcant change of the FS shape, does not seem to induce an
essential change within the DOS.
Let us comment here the relation with the entropy s, Fig. 4.3a. If we assume the low-T form
as follows from the LFL theory , we get
s = π2N(µ)
We see from Fig. 7.8 that N(µ) is only weakly doping dependent at intermediate ch and actually also
quite close to the free-fermion value (assuming a tight-binding model with the hopping parameter
Taking ˜Z ∼0.28 for ch = 3/16, we get s ∼0.29 kB at T = 0.1 t, quite consistent with
thermodynamic results in Sec. 4.2. Here the surprising fact is that such s represents a large increase
over the undoped AFM and appears due to a very low concentration of mobile holes introduced
into an AFM.
Let us now look closer on N(ε) in the underdoped regime. We realize quite clearly that at
ch = 0.12 a pseudogap starts to appear in the DOS at ω = ε −µ ∼0 and becomes even more
pronounced at ch ∼0.06. It is evidently related to a similar phenomenon in A(⃗k, ω) in Fig. 7.1.
In order to establish the origin of such a gap, we follow in Fig. 7.9 the variation of N(ε) with T.
We ﬁnd that the gap structure disappears at T > J, so it must be related to the onset of the
short-range AFM order. Also the gap energy ∆ǫ ≲t seems to be determined rather by J. It is
plausible that the onset temperature is related to pseudogap scale T ∗, discussed before in relation
with the maximum in χ0(T), and with the crossover in ρ(T).
Recently the DOS has been measured via the integrated PES and IPES for LSCO compound in
a wide range of doping 0 < ch < 0.3 . More reliable are PES spectra proportional

N(ε) at various T for dopings: (a) ch = 1/20 and (b) ch = 2/18.
to N +(ω) = N(ω + µ)f(ω), giving information on the hole part ω < 0. Some features are well
consistent with our results. In the overdoped regime ch > 0.2 N +(ω < 0) appears quite ﬂat. At
the same time, there is a substantial and broad IPES contribution indicating an enhanced DOS at
ω > 0. On the other hand, for ch < 0.17 a pseudogap starts to emerge gradually at ω ≲0. E.g., the
inﬂection point in N +(ω) moves from ω ∼0 toward ω ∼−0.2 eV at lowest dopings. This is quite
close to values found in Figs. 7.9. Thus the gap scale indeed seems to be related to the pseudogap
scale T ∗discussed in connection with χ0. Note that the latter is substantially larger than the
leading-edge shift ∼30 meV found in ARPES . Still it is well possible that
both phenomena are closely related.
Other properties
Electron density correlations
It is interesting to study also electron-density dynamics, as contained within the dynamical charge
susceptibility χc(⃗q, ω) and the corresponding density correlation function N(⃗q, ω), deﬁned by
0(1 −e−βω)N(⃗q, ω),
dt eiωt⟨n⃗q(t)n−⃗q(0)⟩,
ei⃗q· ⃗Rini.
Recently several numerical and analytical studies within the t-J model have been devoted to static
N(⃗q) as well as to dynamical N(⃗q, ω) at T = 0, mainly in connection with the interesting conjecture
of the charge-spin separation in layered cuprates. A parallel
study of charge correlations N(⃗q, ω) and the spin structure factor S(⃗q, ω) however reveals quite an
essential diﬀerence between an 1D Luttinger liquid and a 2D doped AFM ,
as well as between charge and spin ﬂuctuations. Typically, N(⃗q, ω) show a broad peak at high
ω ∼6 t at ⃗q ∼⃗Q due to the incoherent motion of holes, while at q →0 density ﬂuctuations narrow
in a collective acoustic-like mode . In contrast to S(⃗q, ω), N(⃗q, ω)
spectra seem to scale linearly with ch at low doping . It should be also noted that
quite generally N(q →0, ω) ﬂuctuations can be related to (anomalous) current correlations C(ω)
through the particle-number conservation, so an anomalous behaviour is quite possible for N(⃗q, ω)
The investigation of N(⃗q, ω) at T > 0 has not been performed so far. We present here some
results, using the FTLM in analogy with the evaluation of S(⃗q, ω) in Sec. 6. Our aim is again
twofold. On one hand, FTLM gives smoother spectra at T > Tfs, which could be compared to g.s.
ED results. More interesting is the low-frequency regime ω < J, which cannot be studied reliably
in g.s. calculations, and moreover the T dependence of spectra in this regime.
In Fig. 8.1 we present normalized spectra N(⃗q, ω)/ch for nonequivalent ⃗q on a lattice of N = 18
sites and ﬁxed T = 0.2 t. In this case we use J/t = 0.4. Shown are results for ch = 1/18 and
ch = 3/18, belonging to regimes of low doping and optimum doping, respectively. We notice that
normalized spectra are very similar for both ch, at least for larger q, taking into account also that a
more detailed structure for ch = 1/18 is partly due to ﬁnite size eﬀects. Our results are in general
close to previous numerical and analytical results. It is characteristic that at ⃗q ∼⃗Q the intensity is nearly exhausted by a large
peak at ω ∼6t. As expected from conservation laws spectra are narrowing for q →0.
It is however remarkable that in spite of quite low T in Fig. 8.1 N(⃗q, ω →0) does not seem to
approach zero for any ⃗q, the eﬀect being more visible for smaller q. We follow the evolution of density
ﬂuctuations with T at intermediate doping ch = 3/16 for chosen ⃗q = (π/3, π/3) in Fig. 8.2. It is
evident that N(⃗q, ω) is nearly T independent even for ω < T. The behaviour is quite similar to the
one observed for local spin correlations ¯S(ω) in Fig. 6.5 and is consistent with the MFL assumption
(2.2) for the charge susceptibility χ′′
c(ω), requiring via the equation (8.1) N(⃗q, ω →0) = const
independent of T. The MFL behaviour of N(⃗q, ω) at intermediate doping is not entirely surprising
due to the connection to the anomalous MFL-type C(ω) and optical conductivity σ(ω), as well due
to the relation of the electron dynamics to anomalous spin ﬂuctuations S(⃗q, ω) .
N(⃗q, ω) have been mainly the subject of theoretical considerations so far. It should be however
noted that a relation could be established with experimentally relevant dielectric function ǫ(⃗q, ω),
if the model would incorporate also the long-range Coulomb repulsion between electrons. Such
an additional interaction could be possibly treated within a framework of an random-phase-like
analysis. It would be desirable since ǫ(⃗q, ω) can be measured also in cuprates via the electronenergy loss spectroscopy which yields directly Im[1/ǫ(⃗q, ω)].
Electronic Raman response
One of very useful probes for the investigation of excitations in an AFM has been the Raman scattering. Using the latter method, it has been also established that the reference insulating cuprates
correspond well to a planar Heisenberg AFM, where pronounced Raman resonance processes at low
T are attributed to two-magnon excitations .
A general framework for the theoretical explanation of Raman processes in correlated systems
has been so far given within the Hubbard model, where the eﬀective Raman operator for resonant
and oﬀ-resonant conditions has been derived . Still there are several
unresolved questions concerning Raman processes in cuprates, and more generally in doped AFM.
(2π/3,2π/3)
Figure 8.1:
Normalized density correlation spectra N(⃗q, ω)/ch at ﬁxed T/t = 0.2 and J/t = 0.4 at
two dopings: ch = 1/18 and ch = 3/18.
One puzzling aspect concerns the observed pronounced T dependence of the two-magnon peak in
undoped cuprates . Another problem is the doping dependence of Raman spectra. Recent experiments, performed on
YBCO materials in the resonant regime , show a dramatic increase of the
broadening of the two-magnon peak with doping, so that spectra appear essentially ﬂat in the
normal phase when approaching the optimum doping. At the same time, the peak position does
not move appreciably.
Here we consider only the resonant Raman processes, since most experiments are performed in
the resonant regime. In contrast to response functions considered in previous sections, the operator
relevant for the resonant Raman scattering cannot be determined uniquely within the t-J model,
since it necessarily involves higher (resonant) levels. Still we can adopt a view that more complete
(e.g. three-band) model for cuprates can be mapped onto an eﬀective Hubbard model (Hybertsen
q=(π/3,π/3)

et al. 1990) for resonant transitions of interest. Within the Hubbard model near half-ﬁlling the
Raman-scattering operator has been derived in the limit t/U ≪1 
yielding the well known form for the Heisenberg AFM ,
(⃗ǫinc · ⃗rij)(⃗ǫsc · ⃗rij)(⃗Si · ⃗Sj −1
where ⃗ǫinc,⃗ǫsc are the incident and the scattered electric-ﬁeld unit vectors, respectively, and the
amplitude factor A = 4t2/(U −ωinc) ∝J incorporates the resonance at the incident-light frequency
ωinc ∼U. The Raman spectral function is then given by
dt eiωt⟨R(t)R(0)⟩,
which can be calculated at T > 0 using the FTLM analogous to other correlation functions.
Within the t-J model with ﬁnite doping the Raman intensity I(ω), corresponding to the operator
(8.2), has been evaluated so far at T = 0 using the ED , while for
the undoped AFM also T > 0 has been studied using the full diagonalization . Results obtained via the FTLM have an advantage over previous ones also for low T, since
the Raman intensity is not expected to be singular for T →0, so much smoother spectra are
obtained by using small but ﬁnite T > Tfs.
We restrict our analysis to the dominant B1g scattering geometry with ⃗ǫinc = (⃗ex +⃗ey)/
⃗ǫsc = (⃗ex −⃗ey)/
2. The undoped AFM at T > Tfs ∼J/2 has been studied by Prelovˇsek and Jakliˇc
 , and reveals at low T a two-magnon Raman peak at ω ∼3.3 J, consistent with experiments.
The width is however quite narrow and starts to broaden substantially only at higher T ∼J, where
a gradual transition to a broad featureless spectrum occurs. Hence other mechanisms have to be
invoked to account for the observed pronounced T-dependent width at lower T ≪J . On the other
hand, the dependence on doping is essential, as evident from Fig. 8.3, where we present I(ω) for
various dopings ch ≤0.25 at lowest T = 0.15 t > Tfs.
Already the smallest nonzero doping
ch = 0.05 increases dramatically the width of the two-magnon peak, while spectral features become
overdamped on approaching the optimum doping ch ∼0.15. It is however remarkable, that the
peak position does not shift appreciably in the underdoped regime ch ≤0.1. Only for ch > 0.15
the spectra change to a broad central-peak form with a maximum at ω = 0.
Figure 8.3: Raman intensity I(ω) for diﬀerent dopings ch at ﬁxed T = 0.15 t.
How can we interpret the above results for the B1g resonant Raman scattering ? Up to the
overdoped situation ch ∼0.3 the scattering seems to be dominated by the spin-exchange part (8.2),
since the latter determines the low-energy ﬂuctuations even at the optimum doping. Still, there
are evident changes with doping, since the reduced AFM correlation length at larger ch induces a
large broadening of the Raman two-magnon peak and a reduction of its intensity. In this respect
the doped system behaves quite similarly to an undoped AFM but at elevated T ∼J.
A systematic resonant-Raman scattering study has been recently performed on a sequence of
YBCO materials (Blumberg et al.
It seems that in the underdoped regime our model
results well reproduce experimental ones, both regarding the shape of the Raman spectra and their
intensity variation with doping. At optimum doping experiments still reveal a weakly pronounced
peak at the same frequency ω ∼3 J, while our results on Fig. 8.3 already reveal a maximum at
ω = 0, nevertheless both spectra are nearly ﬂat.
Thermoelectric power
Among other transport properties the thermoelectric power (TEP) or the Seebeck coeﬃcient S is
one of the most frequently investigated. Within the cuprate family TEP has been measured for
several materials, for an overview see e.g. Kaiser and Uher and more recent analyses . Again an universal behaviour has emerged depending mainly
on hole doping. For weakly doped materials S is large and positive, with some T dependence at
higher T. With increasing doping TEP S decreases rapidly. It also falls oﬀnearly linearly with
T, but with a rather small slope. Quite consistently S is nearly vanishing for the optimum doping
and changes sign to a negative one in overdoped materials. This variation has clearly some parallel
with the doping dependence of the Hall coeﬃcient RH, also showing a transition from a hole-like
behaviour RH > 0 at low doping into an electron-like RH < 0 in overdoped samples. It seems
plausible that both anomalous properties are related and emerge from strong correlations in these
materials.
Theoretically TEP in doped AFM or more generally in strongly correlated metals has not
attracted much attention so far . This is not surprising, since it seems to
require the understanding of both electrical and thermal currents.
Within the linear response theory the TEP can be expressed in terms of particle
current j and energy current jE correlation functions,
µ −CjEj(ω →0)
where mixed correlation function CjEj(ω) is deﬁned in analogy with the expression (5.1) for C(ω).
The evaluation of S(T) thus requires the calculation of CjEj(ω), in addition to the currentcurrent correlation function C(ω) discussed extensively in Sec. 5. It is straightforward to derive
the expression for jE, nevertheless the operator is more involved due to three-site terms. We do
not intend to give here a more complete analysis of CjEj(ω) which will be presented elsewhere.
We mention however only a preliminary observation, that CjEj(ω) and C(ω) appear to be closely
CjEj(ω) = ζC(ω),
i.e. ζ is nearly ω independent for ω < t, but as well T independent at low T < J. Since we are
dealing at ch > 0 with a metal, although with a strange one, we expect a ﬁnite |S(T →0)| < ∞.
Hence we deduce from the equation (8.4) the condition ζ = µ(T = 0). Our numerical results for ζ
are indeed consistent with this assumption.
We thus arrive at the simpliﬁed expression,
e0T [µh(T = 0) −µh(T)],
which involves only µh(T), studied in Sec. 4.1 and shown in Fig. 4.1. In the low-T regime of interest
we claim in a broad regime of doping ch < 0.3 a linear variation (4.3) of µh(T). This leads directly
to S ∼−αS0 where S0kB/e0 = 86µV/K. It is evident from Fig. 7.3 that α is changing sign from
a negative for ch < c∗
h to a positive one for ch > c∗
h. In Fig. 8.4 we plot our result for S(ch).
Note that due to simpliﬁcations involved in the expression (8.6) we do not intend to consider the
T variation, hence our results apply to lowest reachable T ≲Tfs ∼0.1 t. For comparison we
present on the same plot also experimental results for LSCO and oxygen deﬁcient YBCO, taken
from Cooper and Loram , whereby data refer to the normal state at T ∼300K. Qualitative
agreement between theory and experiment is quite reasonable. In LSCO values of S are decreasing
with doping, while S is quite high at low doping ch < 0.05. Towards optimum doping S essentially
vanishes. Similar is the trend for YBCO data, although there are clearly quantitative diﬀerences.
The main disagreement between the calculated and experimental S is in the overdoped regime,
where our results indicate S < 0 with probably too large values. It is however well possible that
in this regime our analysis is not adequate, ﬁrst due to µh(T) approaching more normal LFL T 2
dependence, as well as due to the breakdown of the relation (8.5).

Discussion
In the absence of accepted microscopic or phenomenological theories, which would at least qualitatively describe normal-state properties of cuprates in the whole doping regime, it is also hard to
summarize our numerical results in a compact manner.
It is ﬁrst important to understand which phenomena determine the optimum doping in cuprates
and in microscopic models. In cuprates the optimum is deﬁned by Tc(copt
h ) = max, but at least
very close in doping, i.e., c∗
are also materials where the low-T electronic entropy s and the
uniform susceptibility χ0 are maximum , where the pseudogap scale disappears,
i.e. T ∗→Tc , etc.
Within the t-J model we can associate the optimum so far only with respect to normal-state
properties, e.g. with s(c∗
h) = max. Such a maximum has to exist at a nontrivial c∗
h > 0 due to
the relation (4.6) with µh(T), where the latter must change the sign from a weakly doped AFM
(semiconductor-like regime) at ch ≳0 to a regime of nearly free 2D fermions at ce ∼0. It is plausible
that within the prototype model (2.6) c∗
h is determined by the interplay of the spin exchange energy
EJ = ⟨HJ⟩and the (hole) kinetic energy Et = ⟨Ht⟩. Since at low doping we get |Et| ∝tch and
|EJ| ∝J we can get a rough estimate c∗
h ∝J/t ≪1. From such an argument it seems plausible
that at ch ∼c∗
h the AFM correlation length becomes very short ξ ∼1, while AFM correlations are
essentially irrelevant in the overdoped regime ch > c∗
Universality at intermediate doping
It is evident from our results that normal-state properties are universal at the optimum doping
h. Since the maximum s(ch) is broad within the t-J model also this regime is quite extensive,
0.15 < ch < 0.25 for chosen J/t = 0.3.
The main feature of this regime obtained in our
study is the MFL-type dynamics in several response functions: the local spin susceptibility χ′′
the optical conductivity σ(ω), density correlations N(⃗q, ω), and spectral functions A(⃗k, ω). It is
characteristic that the dynamics in the low-ω (ω < J) regime seems to be universal, i.e.
determined solely by T itself without any additional parameters, as concluded from equations
(5.13) for σ(ω) and (6.13) for χ′′
L(ω). It should be however reminded that this universality could
be restricted to a certain T range, e.g. we can show its validity only for Tfs < T < J.
It seems that the origin of the universality is in the large degeneracy of the spin subsystem,
where the frustration in induced by the hole doping. A plausible argument is that holes tend to
induce FM correlations to minimize kinetic energy, while spins prefer an AFM ordering. In any
case, only spins have enough degrees of freedom to explain large entropy s ∼0.4 kB even at T < J.
Let us attempt an explanation for the universality of ¯S(ω) at ch ∼c∗
From the explicit
representation in terms of eigenstates,
¯S(ω) = (1 + e−βω)
i |Ψm⟩|2δ(ω −Em + En),
we can ﬁrst discuss conditions that the response is T independent for ω > T. Since in this case
the prefactor is constant, a naive requirement appears to be that low lying states En −E0 < T
have similar matrix elements to excited states with Em −En > T. Nevertheless the validity of this
observation clearly depends on the character and on the density of low-lying many-body states,
and e.g. does not apply at low T to a system with a unique g.s. As realized from the entropy
results in Sec. 4.2 the degeneracy and the density of many-body states is clearly very large at the
intermediate doping. To explain the T independence of ¯S(ω) even for ω < T, we recall the sum rule
(6.11) and assume that there is no characteristic scale ωc < T which could introduce an additional
low-ω structure in ¯S(ω). A natural candidate for such a scale in an AFM is the (gap) frequency
ωc ∼c/ξ where c is the spin wave velocity and ξ the AFM correlation length. Here originates the
essential diﬀerence between an undoped and the optimally doped AFM. In a pure AFM within the
renormalized classical regime ξ is exponentially large for T ≪J and
consequently ωc ≪T. On the other hand, at the intermediate doping ξ appears to be short and
not strongly T dependent, i.e. ξ ∝1/√ch. The latter situation excludes ωc < T < J, hence leading
to an universal ¯S(ω).
Turning to the discussion of σ(ω), as given by the equation (5.13), we realize that it is not
meaningful to associate 1/τ(0) ∝T with a current relaxation rate. Namely the current-current
correlation function C(ω) shows a broad uniform spectrum indicating on a very fast current decay
with 1/˜τ ∼2t. Thus it seems that a general condition for the validity of the speciﬁc MFL form
(5.13) is a fast current decay with 1/˜τ ≫T. This could happen due to holes moving in a disordered
spin subsystem, which leads to entirely incoherent collisions among holes and the appropriate mean
free path ls is only few unit cells. Hence it seems that we are dealing with a novel phenomenon of
quantum diﬀusion which follows an universal form (5.13).
In an analogous way also the relaxation of single electron states near FS is aﬀected, as manifested
in the MFL form of the self energy Σ(⃗k, ω), equation (7.11). Anyhow it is plausible that the QP
damping Σ′′(k ∼kF , ω) and the current relaxation 1/τ(ω), as given by the equation (5.17), are
closely related. There are also phenomenological arguments which
indicate that the MFL-type dynamics of a boson (spin) subsystem implies a MFL behaviour of the
electron propagator. Recently such a relation has been derived by one of the authors , employing a decoupling approximation for the projected GR(⃗k, ω).
On the other hand it should be stressed that within the same regime certain electronic properties
appear quite normal, i.e. close to the LFL behaviour. First, spectral functions indicate on a rather
well deﬁned large FS following the Luttinger theorem.
This seems to indicate that correlated
electronic state evolves continuously from a noninteracting one, whereby the FS can be traced to
momenta of lowest (g.s.) many-body states. It is much harder to explain quite LFL behaviour of
the entropy s ∝T at low T, as seen in Fig. 4.3a, and moreover a free-fermion-like Wilson ratio
W ∼W0, as found in Sec. 6.2.
It should be noted again that such an universality could be restricted to a certain T window.
Namely it is well possible that at low T ∼Tcoh some coherence or ordering could appear. Note
however that e.g. the onset of a spin ordering would invalidate our arguments on the MFL-type
universality in the low-T phase. This is relevant for cuprates showing stripe structures or longer range incommensurate ordering . Even in this case the
dynamics at higher-ω is possibly not aﬀected by the ordering, as seen in the analysis of the neutron
scattering experiments in Sec. 6.6.
At the intermediate doping our numerical results do not give an indication for a coherence
temperature Tcoh, where the breakdown of the universality is expected. This is not surprising in
view of the experimental facts for cuprates where at optimum doping Tcoh ∼Tc and our Tfs > Tc.
Nevertheless we note that certain restrictions follow already from the MFL-type dynamics. E.g.,
the particular MFL form (5.13) for σ(ω) leads at T →0 to a divergent integral on the lower bound
ω →0 and hence violates the optical sum rule (5.8).
Therefore such a form cannot apply to
arbitrary low T giving an indication for the existence of a lower crossover Tcoh.
Energy scales in underdoped antiferromagnet
The underdoped regime ch < c∗
h is less convenient for the FTLM approach. One reason is that
Tfs is increasing towards the undoped AFM. At the same time the low-energy (pseudogap) scale is
increasing and its eﬀects are for certain quantities hardly resolvable from ﬁnite-size eﬀects, hence
they increase the uncertainty of results.
Still there are clear indications for the pseudogap scale T ∗within the t-J model. Most evident is
the maximum in χ0(T), as presented in Sec. 6.2. Quite a similar behaviour can be followed also for
s(T)/T, as deduced e.g. from Fig. 4.3a. This is related to nearly constant Wilson ratio RW (T) ∼1,
as deﬁned in the equation (6.7). Note that such a behaviour has been found also experimentally by
Loram et al. , extending to low-T regime not reachable in our calculations. It is quite evident
from χ(T) that the pseudogap scale T ∗is related to the onset of short range AFM correlations.
It seems that the same phenomenon governs the pseudogap appearing in the DOS N(ε) in the
underdoped regime, as discussed in Sec. 7.4. While the pseudogap is clearly visible for lowest ch, e.g.
for ch ∼0.06, it is becomes more shallow towards the optimum doping ch ∼c∗
h. This is consistent
with PES measurements by Ino et al. . Experimentally one of the indications for T ∗is also
the change of the slope in ρ(T). Here our results are less conclusive and appear to be ﬁnite-size
limited for T < T ∗. A possible interpretation is that the QP scattering in the presence of longer
range AFM correlations becomes a diﬀerent one, in particular the mean free path ls increases due
to the opening of the spin pseudogap. In our small systems this possibly leads to ls(T < T ∗) > L
and consequently to a ﬁnite-size Dc(T < T ∗) > 0 which cannot be interpreted uniquely. Note that
so far there is neither a satisfactory theory nor a numerical calculation of the mobility µ0(T < J),
even for a single hole in an AFM which could serve as a guide for the limit ch →0.
Experiments indicate the existence of a lower crossover scale Tsg , see Fig. 2.1,
identiﬁed as a spin gap in the NMR relaxation and appearing also in the ARPES, σc(ω) etc. In our
calculations it would be easiest to resolve the existence of a spin gap in χ0(T) and in ¯S(ω), still we
do not ﬁnd an indication for that down to T ∼0.1 t.
Conclusions and open questions
One of the main conclusions of this work is that the prototype t-J model, in spite of its apparent
simplicity, accounts surprisingly well for a variety of normal state properties of cuprates. This
conﬁrms the belief that most unusual properties are dominated by strong correlations and by the
interplay of antiferromagnetism and itinerant character of electrons, both eﬀects being inherent
within the model. The agreement is a qualitative but as well a quantitative one, hence the parameters of the model appear to be really microscopic ones in the whole range of doping and not just
some eﬀective parameters changing with doping.
There are evidently many open questions regarding the interpretation and the understanding
of our results, and related experimental facts on cuprates:
a) The universal MFL-type dynamics in the intermediate regime, which seems to be well founded
by our results on σ(ω), χ′′
L(ω) and self energies, as well as by experimental facts, lacks a proper theoretical explanation, although some relations have been proposed already .
b) There are more fundamental problems in the underdoped regime. One of them is the evolution
of the FS in the limit ch →0. A number of authors investigated the evidence for the small FS
- hole pockets and its possible consequences at low doping, also stimulated by recent ARPES measurements of
underdoped materials. In a strict sense at T →0 the transformation from a large to a small FS
seems to require a phase transition with a qualitative change in a number of properties. There is
no evidence for that neither in experiments nor in our small-system analysis. On the other hand
our spectral functions at lowest ch > 0 reveal a folding of QP dispersion analogous to a single hole
in an AFM. Still it is possible that such a feature coexists with a normal QP dispersion crossing of
a large FS, however with a weight ˜Z →0, i.e. gradually vanishing with doping as predicted by the
equation (7.12). Such a scenario is not in contradiction with ARPES results. It has been in fact
recently deduced from the integrated PES experiments , still it would be hard to
establish it beyond doubt.
c) Related is the question of the thermodynamics at very low doping. There is a distinction whether
at low T QP behave as a degenerate Fermi gas with ﬁnite QP weight ˜Z > 0 even for ch →0, or as a
nondegenerate system of spin polarons with ˜Z →0. In the ﬁrst case one could expect for ch, T →0
a ﬁnite electron compressibility κ < ∞, as discussed in Sec. 4.1, while the alternative would induce
κ →∞. Our results are not conclusive in this respect, there is however also a numerical evidence
for the latter scenario within the Hubbard model , while at the same time also the physics
of the Hall conductivity is less local. The anomalous properties of the orbital diamagnetism χd(T)
and its relation to the Hall eﬀect, equation (6.19), nevertheless conﬁrm the anomalous behaviour
of RH(T). Also perpendicular σc(ω) is known to be a challenge for theoreticians. Still it appears
that the interplane transport is essentially incoherent for T > Tc, so it could be possibly related to
the knowledge of planar spectral functions A(⃗k, ω).
The major open question within the t-J (or Hubbard) model is still the existence of additional
low energy scales and of related low-T transitions. There are certain indications that such scales
must exist in such models, it remains however a subject of future studies to ﬁnd whether such
transitions lead to an ordered spin and charge structure or to desired superconductivity.
