Online learning has become a popular method of education. Faculty members may know little about how
to assist students in succeeding in a new learning environment, and students may be ill-prepared to tackle
the new demands put upon them. Therefore, this research seeks to identify dimensions of successful
online learners by examining primary screening documents and then mapping them to the literature base.
Next, experienced online educators are asked to review the dimensions and to provide strategies that they
use to ensure student success. Seven dimensions are identified and confirmed as significant, each
dimension with slightly different importance— including access to tools; technology experience; learning
preferences; study habits and skills; goals or purposes; lifestyle factors; and personal traits and
characteristics. In addition, several online teaching strategies (including students’ posting biographies;
frequent interaction; collaboration; requiring participation; question-asking forums; topical flexibility; and
minimizing technology requirements) have been recommended.

INTRODUCTION
Learners throughout the world are demanding educational opportunities in an “anytime and anywhere”
format, and institutions are responding by devoting substantial resources to develop online distance
learning. Online learning has thus rapidly become a popular method of education for traditional and nontraditional students. Estimates are that by 2001 “more than 75% of traditional US colleges and
universities will use distance-learning technologies and techniques in one or more ‘traditional’ academic
JALN Volume 6, Issue 1 - July 2002
programs” . Faculty members are under enormous pressure to join this transition and put their courses
online. However, this is not a simple endeavor; and the challenge is to understand the relationships
between the user and the technology, the instructor and the participants, and the relationships among the
participants , , . Faculty members may have technical or pedagogical support in making this
transition in their teaching; however, they may know little about how to assist students in succeeding in a
new learning environment.
To provide information to assist faculty members to work with students in understanding the demands of
online learning, as well as to better design effective online learning environments, this research seeks to
identify the dimensions that characterize successful online learners. Next, the research gathers
information from experienced online educators in order to validate these dimensions and investigate the
strategies they have employed to support and insure success for all their students.
II. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
Recent developments in technology and access have offered organizations and universities the
opportunity to improve traditional passive distance learning environments through increased
communication, interactivity among participants, and incorporation of collaborative pedagogical models,
specifically through electronic networks and groupware , , . In this transformed model of distance
learning, learners expect interactivity and close to “traditional” classroom based education. The demand
for online courses, enhanced by the ease of access, media attention, and interest from the private sector,
has accelerated the rush toward online learning activities. Some of the courses are traditional subject
matter courses, often undergraduate, while others are geared more toward ongoing professional work
activity. These include informal courses, professional development tutorials, and even full degree
programs. Much uncertainty exists, however, about the conditions that are essential to create a successful
venture for both educators and learners.
A growing body of literature has begun to emerge about the nature of learning online. Development of
any educational environment is a complex task, but faculty members have had an especially difficult time
changing the ways in which they teach in this milieu, regardless of these educators’ own personal use of
electronic media . Faculty members must develop and design their activities and interactions in new
ways, and they may be frustrated without the ability to recognize when students are puzzled .
Specifically, the traditional hierarchy is flattened, and the power and control are redistributed . Kember
urged designers to work toward deep learning, which requires moving away from excessive assignments,
shallow assessments, and lack of freedom in activities . These challenges go far beyond the need to be
comfortable with the reliance on technology to support their courses .
Wiesenberg and Hutton identified three major challenges for the designer to consider: increasing time for
delivery of the course (they estimate two or three times what is necessary for a traditional course),
creating a sense of online community, and encouraging students to become independent learners .
They also reported fewer interactions than expected from participants of an online course.
These issues all have implications for faculty members and for students in an online environment. Quality
assurance in these programs can be determined through outcome based evaluation, student feedback,
appropriate technological and pedagogical support, and reviews by specialists (external and internal) of
both the program and the instruction material .
Many educators work toward development of a virtual learning community, to move the experience
beyond that of a collection of web based activities. Rogers used Wenger’s theory of legitimate peripheral
JALN Volume 6, Issue 1 - July 2002
practice to investigate online learning communities , . He found that students were willing to
engage in mutual engagement, joint enterprise, and shared repertoire in their course activities. Yet other
research identified difficulties of students in online courses. Cognitive scientists and software engineers
suggest that individuals must create mental models to be able to understand and internalize what is
happening in this new environment . One study suggested that students had to take time to move
through the initial efforts of learning the tools before they began constructing new knowledge .
Another study confirms the necessity for learners to have support to learn and act out their roles in these
situations .
One graduate course demonstrated that even in the case of having independent online lessons, it was
useful to add a component that required students to interact with their colleagues in some way .
Similarly, it was important to build in practice opportunities for the students to refine their evaluative and
analytical skills to be able to successfully use the enormous amount of information on the Internet .
III. METHODOLOGY
This research was accomplished through two distinct phases, each employing appropriate methods.
A. Phase One
Phase One was designed to identify the characteristics or dimensions that appeared to play a significant
role in the success and satisfaction of students in an online class. Concerns have been raised that potential
students of online learning may not fully understand or appreciate the challenges that they face, and
further that instructors may not appreciate the challenges that their online students face. The goal was to
analyze the topics typically presented to potential students as “advanced organizers” and identify common
elements . The material was derived from a variety of sources. To begin, an examination was made
of over seventy institutions throughout the world that currently offer post-secondary online learning
opportunities. While many more organizations do offer online courses, only those that appeared to have
an educational focus, and other components that seem essential for post-secondary education (library
facilities, student support personnel, etc.) were considered. The original group was narrowed again, so
that only those that offered potential students a chance to investigate their own suitability for this
environment, through a substantive needs-assessment, (including advanced organizers, surveys, or other
materials) were ultimately considered. This process resulted in a final group of over thirty such
institutions.
A document analysis was then completed on those instruments. Standard document analysis techniques
were employed to compare the similarities, distinguish the areas of divergence, and identify the various
functions of presentation, scoring, feedback, and supporting documentation , . After the analysis
was completed, a substantial literature review was undertaken, to verify the practical field analysis and to
identify areas or characteristics that were missing from that analysis.
B. Phase Two
Once these dimensions were identified, it was important to verify them through discussion by those with
expertise in this area. The information was aggregated and then presented to a sample of online educators.
A purposeful sampling was used, which is based on the assumption that one wants to discover,
understand, and gain insight, and “therefore one needs to select a sample from which one can learn the
most” . Researchers determined particular participants to include because they were known to have
JALN Volume 6, Issue 1 - July 2002
designed and taught online courses for considerable amounts of time and rate themselves as successful
online educators. Participants were further chosen by using a “snowball” model of asking the original
experienced educators to nominate others, from around the world. A sample was selected from those who
volunteered among the qualified online educators. Ultimately fourteen individuals participated in this
A web survey was created in which the dimensions were presented with a detailed explanation.
Respondents were asked to answer three questions about each dimension on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1
indicating the respondents strongly disagreed with the statement, and 5 indicating they strongly agreed.
The survey also requested that the respondents describe strategies they have used to support and
encourage their online students and to identify any other dimensions that may have been missed. The
responses to the Likert questions were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics. The open-ended
responses were analyzed using constant comparative methods , . The researchers performed this
analysis individually and then compared and discussed the findings and their meanings.
IV. RESULTS
The analysis of the materials derived from the institutions as well as a comprehensive body of literature
yielded seven dimensions as critical factors that impact the success of adults who enroll in distance
learning courses and degree programs. Although these dimensions are presented separately, in reality they
do not function independently. Rather, they are inter-related, as are the pieces of a puzzle, and work
together to support or challenge the online learner.
The educators also provided valuable information about the seven dimensions, and several responded that
completing the survey gave them time to reflect about their online teaching. In the following section, the
seven dimensions are presented with explanations, mean and mode from the survey results, as well as the
minimum and maximum scores, to provide some idea of the range of responses on each item.
Additionally, experts’ comments and strategies are presented with each dimension.
Access to the tools was an obvious but also undervalued component. The more difficulty the student
experienced in getting to the equipment, the easier it was to find reasons to drop the course. The
respondents perceived this dimension as significant. Students without regular access to appropriate tools,
at home or at their work tend to have more difficulty in succeeding in online learning. Those with reliable
access at home were considered to be at a distinct advantage, because they are able to focus on their
learning on their own time schedule.

lack of access.
Respondents strongly agreed that this is an important consideration. One stated, “…students, in my
experience, tend to get more anxious about the lack of technology and then fail to engage in the
coursework to any great depth.” Another pointed out, “Their ‘minimum’ requirements in fact are rising
fairly consistently, and as institutions continue to integrate learning/teaching technologies into their
courses, this will have growing implications for stratifying access to “the right” tools/information/skills,
B. Technology Experience
It was not sufficient to have access to the appropriate tools. Students needed to have a level of comfort
with using the tools – experience in solving simple problems, checking email, and accomplishing basic
tasks (printing or file management, for example). Respondents considered students to have a significant
challenge if they had to learn both technology and content at the same time. They reported that they
helped students overcome technological discomfort by providing support. For example, one introduced
students to the “technological ropes” of the course and allowed them to practice navigating, and another
provided support resources, such as CD and video, that guided students through an online environment so
they can become familiar with the environment before they begin the course.

Comments by the respondents extended the understanding of this dimension; one respondent offers the
following comment:
It is a challenge for students inexperienced in technology to learn both the technology and content
simultaneously. However, a well designed course (using the simplest technology needed to meet the
learning objectives) and user-friendly courseware go a long way to ameliorate this difficulty.
C. Learning Preferences
Individuals must be able to recognize their own abilities and styles, in order to ask or modify the learning
necessary for online environments. This means that a learner who needs to hear classmates discuss
difficult theories will need to compensate for this in other ways. It may mean having chat sessions online,
or even telephone conference calls. Students can take advantage of visual learning opportunities as well as
multiple ways of presenting the content with an online class. However, the educators reported that some
JALN Volume 6, Issue 1 - July 2002
students have trouble finishing a course because they are concerned about learning alone. They suggested
that students work in a group so they feel they are learning in a collaborative and social environment.

The expert online educators had a lot to say about this particular dimension. One pointed out, “Of course,
these things are/will be true even in face-to-face learning environments.” Another commented, “Why
would we not want to take advantage of the visual learning opportunities with online classes?” And yet,
another indicated:
I agree that multiple modalities would help learners who have difficulty reading alone. However, I
believe benefits do not outweigh the difficulties such as the increase in download time and students’
technical difficulties when adding media files.
D. Study Habits and Skills
Learners appear to appreciate the greater control over their learning; yet with that control comes
substantial responsibility for completing assignments and being prepared. However, it may be more
difficult to stay focused on assignments when sitting alone with a pile of work. People may believe that
distance education is quick or easy, however, they quickly learn that many programs challenge the learner
with reading and writing assignments. The educators suggested that giving some flexibility was a good
way to help students study on their own. For example, they allowed students a block of time in which
students may work at their own pace, instead of running a class in a lock step that would have online
students essentially behaving like on-campus students. Some of the educators reported that it was
occasionally difficult for them to notice how confused students may be from the readings unless they
asked frequent questions. The educators suggested that minimum requirements for posting questions and
answers on the readings may force students to work harder than in a face-to-face class. Due to the
required extra effort, students sometimes find an online class more challenging.

in an online situation.
This dimension produced a wide variety of opinions. Comments ranged from “It is difficult to know just
how confused students are by the readings and assignments unless they ask questions” to “Quite often
students don’t tell me they are having difficulties… they just don’t do the work and I assume they are
having difficulties!” Another added, “It (online) creates a different kind of interaction (not necessarily
worse, but different) … calling for other avenues of perception and response to students’ confusion,
anxiety, anger, disagreement, discovery, etc.” One did express his/her own concern, “I can sense they
may be confused, but at what point should intervention take place is an ongoing issue.”
E. Goals and Purposes
Adults have a variety of reasons for seeking educational experiences, and these may include a mandatory
upgrade of skills, requirement for additional credits to maintain licensure, need to change careers, or a
simple desire to gain knowledge. Explicating this motivation does a great deal to assist in completion of
online courses. The educators reported that their successful students usually have high levels of
motivation. And, students’ purpose for taking the class often tends to impact their initial level of
participation.

Motivation of students was apparently a topic of much discussion among educators in online
environments. One respondent said, “I believe those students who choose to take my classes are more
motivated.” Another said, “Motivation seems to be a key factor, but not by itself.” Yet, one commented,
“Our retention rate in our full Bachelor of Teaching degree online is 80%+ over the past four years. These
students are selected by an interview process which looks at potential success factors.” The point of
careful selection seemed clear to many of the respondents. Another said, “My students are selected, so
they are usually self motivated. The drop out rate is low.”
F. Lifestyle Factors
It was clear that students had to be aware of the responsibilities that govern their lives, and needed to
JALN Volume 6, Issue 1 - July 2002
determine if they would have 10-20 hours a week to devote to studying. They may also determine if they
have some flexibility in their schedules, or if little room exists for rearrangement. Another significant
factor is the amount of support they have from family, friends and co-workers as they pursue their studies.
Most students who have dropped an online course mentioned a lack of time to devote to studying. Work
related travel and childcare responsibilities are often cited as reasons for non-completion. So, it was
deemed important that students have family support. The educators suggested that students need to
understand how to balance the complex aspects of their lives with their study programs.

Respondents had a lot of agreement on this dimension. One said, “Most students who have dropped my
online courses cite a lack of time to complete all the work.” One reported on his/her own research and
said that “…virtually all students (91%) are working at least 10 hours/week outside the home while they
are taking an online course, and 55% are working 30 hours/week or more.” One educator provided his/her
strategy for this dilemma, “I tell students what I expect of them up front (approximately 150 hours). If
that doesn’t seem likely, I suggest they take the class in a different semester….” And again, it was pointed
out, “These things hold true for both online and face-to-face classes.”
G. Personal Traits and Characteristics
This dimension offers a perspective on fundamental ways in which individuals actually handle their daily
activities, and patterns of behavior that go far beyond school related issues. This includes questions about
the way one completes daily tasks. Successful online students tend to have a strong commitment to put in
their time and effort for the class. The educators reported that the individual differences, such as lack of
willingness and self-discipline, are critical factors that impact student success in online classes because
there is a higher level of personal responsibility demanded for online students to complete the course.

While some of the respondents to this survey felt this dimension was tied closely to study skills, others
thought this comprised a separate set of considerations. One said, “The problems that result from
individual differences such as lack of organization and self-discipline are more apparent online…the
assignments are late!… Overall there is a higher level of personal responsibility demanded of the online
student.” Again, students have a need to express their concerns to be able to work through any difficulties
they are encountering.
In summary, all of the fourteen experts strongly agreed on the importance of students having access to the
appropriate tools and having technology experiences prior to taking online classes. They agreed that
lifestyle factors, such as completing time demands, play an important role in students' completing online
course. Also they showed an agreement on the importance of learning preferences. Most of these experts
emphasized the importance of students' goals and purposes that motivated them to take an online course.
Study habits and skills, and personal characteristics were not seen as highly important, however, most of
the experts commented that self-discipline is one of the most important factors that contributes to success
in online learning.
RECOMMENDATIONS
It is interesting to note that complete agreement did not exist as to the importance of all seven dimensions,
and yet, overall, acceptance that these factors are importance was fairly clear. In addition to the strategies
given above, these experts summarized their tactics and approaches to online learning. They provided the
following suggestions:
 Encourage students to post a short autobiography at the beginning of the course so make them feel
they know each other. Ideally, an initial face-to-face meeting or even some informal gatherings
during the course establish a sense of community and thus facilitate an active participation.
 Interact with students on a one-to-one and regular basis, especially for those who fall behind. If
needed, give support over the phone as well as a site visit.
 Have students work collaboratively on their assignments. Further, encourage students to share
their individual work with other students and benefit from feedback.
 Establish minimum levels of participation in a discussion and thus promote ongoing contributions
to reciprocal knowledge building.
 Provide readings that are up to date and interesting but at the same time challenging.
 Create some places in an online environment where students can ask each other for help and also
create an open forum where students can ask questions directly to a teacher.
 Be flexible in terms of course topics and procedures, and allow these topics to be predominantly
generated by students. Even allow students to set up their individual learning goals and negotiate
with them.
 Design an online environment using a technologically minimalist approach, reducing
technological requirements and potential difficulties.
JALN Volume 6, Issue 1 - July 2002
In summary, the educators were incorporating active, collaborative, and constructivist learning strategies
for their online classes rather than taking a traditional lecture model. They credited their success to their
individual willingness to respond and their flexible style of working with individuals and groups of
learners. They also agreed that the more potential learners knew before they began taking an online
course, the better their experience and outcomes would be.
VI. CONCLUSION
Currently many public, private, and for-profit institutions are rushing toward the development and
promotion of electronic educational environments. Their motivations are quite varied, but, overall, student
success must be an outcome worthy of attention. This research presents seven dimensions of student
success in online environments and also gathers various perspectives on these dimensions from educators
who are well experienced in teaching in these environments. The experienced educators provide valuable
insight into their strategies for ensuring student success and methods of accommodation for those students
new to the online learning world. Most importantly, there is agreement that potential students have a need
to understand the qualities and characteristics of online learning. It is essential that educators share their
experiences as a body of research develops, new theories about this phenomenon evolve, and significant
numbers of learners look to institutions for appropriate learning opportunities.
