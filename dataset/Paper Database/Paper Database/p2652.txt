Structure, function and diversity of the
healthy human microbiome
The Human Microbiome Project Consortium*
Studies of the human microbiome have revealed that even healthy individuals differ remarkably in the microbes that
occupy habitats such as the gut, skin and vagina. Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet,
environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the
ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort
and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat’s
signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among
individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81–99% of the genera, enzyme families and community
configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was
stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of
the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range
of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future
characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome.
A total of 4,788 specimens from 242 screened and phenotyped adults1
(129 males, 113 females) were available for this study, representing the
majority of the target Human Microbiome Project (HMP) cohort of
300 individuals. Adult subjects lacking evidence of disease were
recruited based on a lengthy list of exclusion criteria; we will refer
to them here as ‘healthy’, as defined by the consortium clinical
sampling criteria (K. Aagaard et al., manuscript submitted).
Women were sampled at 18 body habitats, men at 15 (excluding three
vaginal sites), distributed among fivemajor bodyareas.Ninespecimens
were collected from the oral cavity and oropharynx: saliva; buccal
mucosa (cheek), keratinized gingiva (gums), palate, tonsils, throat
andtonguesofttissues,andsupra-andsubgingivaldentalplaque(tooth
biofilm above and below the gum). Four skin specimens were collected
from the two retroauricular creases (behind each ear) and the two
antecubital fossae (inner elbows), and one specimen for the anterior
nares (nostrils). A self-collected stool specimen represented the microbiota of the lower gastrointestinal tract, and three vaginal specimens
were collected from the vaginal introitus, midpoint and posterior
fornix. To evaluate within-subject stability of the microbiome, 131
individuals in these data were sampled at an additional time point
(mean 219 days and s.d. 69 days after firstsampling, range35–404 days).
After quality control, these specimens were used for 16S rRNA gene
analysis via 454 pyrosequencing (abbreviated henceforth as 16S profiling, mean 5,408 and s.d. 4,605 filtered sequences per sample); to assess
function, 681 samples were sequenced using paired-end Illumina
shotgun metagenomic reads (mean 2.9gigabases (Gb) and s.d. 2.1 Gb
per sample)1. More details on data generation are provided in related
HMP publications1 and in Supplementary Methods.
Microbial diversity of healthy humans
The diversity of microbes within a given body habitat can be defined as
the number and abundance distribution of distinct types of organisms,
which has been linked to several human diseases: low diversity in the
gut to obesity and inflammatoryboweldisease2,3, for example, and high
diversity in the vagina to bacterial vaginosis4. For this large study
involving microbiome samples collected from healthy volunteers at
two distinct geographic locations in the United States, we have defined
themicrobial communities at each body habitat, encountering 81–99%
of predicted genera and saturating the range of overall community
configurations (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Table 1; see also Fig. 4). Oral and stool communities were especially
diverse in terms of community membership, expanding prior observations5, and vaginal sites harboured particularly simple communities
(Fig. 1a). This study established that these patterns of alpha diversity
(within samples) differed markedly from comparisons between
samples from the same habitat among subjects (beta diversity,
Fig. 1b). For example, the saliva had among the highest median alpha
diversities of operational taxonomic units (OTUs, roughly species level
classification, see but one of the lowest
beta diversities—so although each individual’s saliva was ecologically
rich, members of thepopulationshared similar organisms. Conversely,
the antecubital fossae (skin) had the highest beta diversity but were
intermediateinalphadiversity.Thevaginahadthelowestalphadiversity,
with quite low beta diversity at the genus level but very high among
OTUs due to the presence of distinct Lactobacillus spp. (Fig. 1b). The
primary patterns of variation in community structure followed the
major body habitat groups (oral, skin, gut and vaginal), defining as a
resultthecompleterangeofpopulation-widebetween-subjectvariation
in human microbiome habitats (Fig. 1c). Within-subject variation over
time was consistently lower than between-subject variation, both in
organismal composition and in metabolic function (Fig. 1d). The

No taxa were observed to be universally present among all body
habitats and individuals at the sequencing depth employed here,
unlike several pathways (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2, see below),
although several clades demonstrated broad prevalence and relatively
abundant carriage patterns6,7. Instead, as suggested by individually

focused studies2,3,5,8,9, each body habitat in almost every subject was
characterized by one or a few signature taxa making up the plurality of
the community (Fig. 3). Signature clades at the genus level formed on
average anywhere from 17% to 84% of their respective body habitats,
completely absent in some communities (0% at this level of detection)
and representing the entire population (100%) in others. Notably, less
dominant taxa were also highly personalized, both among individuals
and body habitats; in the oral cavity, for example, most habitats are
dominated by Streptococcus, but these are followed in abundance by
Haemophilus in the buccal mucosa, Actinomyces in the supragingival
plaque, and Prevotella in the immediately adjacent (but low oxygen)
subgingival plaque10.
Additional taxonomic detail of the human microbiome was provided by identifying unique marker sequences in metagenomic data11
(Fig. 3a) to complement 16S profiling (Fig. 3b). These two profiles
were typically in close agreement (Supplementary Fig. 3), with the
former in some cases offering more specific information on members
of signature genera differentially present within habitats (for example,
vaginal Prevotella amnii and gut Prevotella copri) or among individuals (for example, vaginal Lactobacillus spp.) One application of this
specificity was to confirm the absence of NIAID (National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases) class A–C pathogens above 0.1%
abundance (aside from Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli)
from the healthy microbiome, but the near-ubiquity and broad distribution of opportunistic ‘pathogens’ as defined by PATRIC12.
Canonical pathogens including Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium
avium, Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica were not
detected at this level of sensitivity. Helicobacter pylori was found in
only two stool samples, both at ,0.01%, and E. coli was present at
.0.1% abundance in 15% of stool microbiomes (.0% abundance in
61%). Similar species-level observations were obtained for a small
subset of stool samples with 454 pyrosequencing metagenomics data
using PhylOTU13,14. In total 56 of 327 PATRIC pathogens were
detected in the healthy microbiome (at .1% prevalence of .0.1%
abundance, Supplementary Table 2), all opportunistic and, strikingly,
typically prevalent both among hosts and habitats. The latter is in
contrast to many of the most abundant signature taxa, which were
usually more habitat-specific and variable among hosts (Fig. 3a, b).
This overall absence of particularly detrimental microbes supports the
hypothesis that even given this cohort’s high diversity, the microbiota
tend to occupy a range of configurations in health distinct from many
of the disease perturbations studied to date3,15.

Carriage of specific microbes
Inter-individual variation in the microbiome proved to be specific,
functionally relevant and personalized. One example of this is illustrated by the Streptococcus spp. of the oral cavity. The genus dominates
the oropharynx16, with different species abundant within each sampled
body habitat (see and, even at the
species level, marked differences in carriage within each habitat among
individuals (Fig. 4a). As the ratio of pan- to core-genomes is high in
many human-associated microbes17, this variation in abundance could
be due to selective pressures acting on pathways differentially present
among Streptococcus species or strains (Fig. 4b). Indeed, we observed
extensive strain-level genomic variation within microbial species in
this population, enriched for host-specific structural variants around
genomic islands (Fig. 4c). Even with respect to the single Streptococcus
mitis strain B6, gene losses associated with these events were common,
for example differentially eliminating S. mitis carriage of the V-type
ATPase or choline binding proteins cbp6 and cbp12 among subsets of
the host population (Fig. 4d). These losses were easily observable by
comparison to reference isolate genomes, and these initial findings
indicate that microbial strain- and host-specific gene gains and
polymorphisms may be similarly ubiquitous.
Other examples of functionally relevant inter-individual variation
at the species and strain levels occurred throughout the microbiome.
In the gut, Bacteroides fragilis has been shown to prime T-cell
responses in animal models via the capsular polysaccharide A18,
and in the HMP stool samples this taxon was carried at a level of at
least 0.1% in 16% of samples (over 1% abundance in 3%). Bacteroides

S. aureus (MRSA) infections, had 29% nasal and 4% skin carriage
rates, roughly as expected20. Close phylogenetic relatives such as
Staphylococcus epidermidis (itself considered commensal) were, in
contrast, universal on the skin and present in 93% of nares samples,
and at the opposite extreme Pseudomonas aeruginosa (a representative
Gram-negative skin pathogen) was completely absent from both body
habitats(0%atthislevelofdetection).Theseandthedata abovesuggest
that the carriage pattern of some species in the human microbiome
may be analogous to genetic traits, where recessive alleles of modest
risk are maintained in a population. In the case of the human microbiome, high-risk pathogens remain absent, whereas species that pose a
modest degree of risk also seem to be stably maintained in this
ecological niche.
Finally, microorganisms within and among body habitats exhibited
relationships suggestive of driving physical factors such as oxygen,
moisture and pH, host immunological factors, and microbial interactions such as mutualism or competition21 (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Both overall community similarity and microbial co-occurrence and
co-exclusion across the human microbiome grouped the 18 body
habitats together into four clusters corresponding to the five target
body areas (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). There was little distinction
among different vaginal sites, with Lactobacillus spp. dominating all
three and correlating in abundance. However, Lactobacillus varied
inversely with the Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes (see Supplementary Fig. 4c and Figs 2 and 3), as also observed in a previous cohort9.
Gut microbiota relationships primarily comprised inverse associations with the Bacteroides, which ranged from dominant in some
subjects to a minority in others who carried a greater diversity of
Firmicutes. A similar progression was evident in the skin communities,
Staphylococcus
Firmicutes),
Propionibacterium, or Corynebacterium (both phylum Actinobacteria),
with a continuum of oral organisms (for example, Streptococcus) appearing in nares communities (Supplementary Fig. 4c). These observations
suggest that microbial community structure in these individuals
may sometimes occupy discrete configurations and under other
circumstances vary continuously, a topic addressed in more detail by
several HMP investigations (ref. 6 and unpublished results). An
individual’s location within such configurations is indicativeof current
microbial carriage (including pathogens) and of the community’s
ability to resist future pathogen acquisition or dysbiosis; it may thus
prove to be associated with disease susceptibility or other phenotypic
characteristics.
Microbiome metabolism and function
As the first study to include both marker gene and metagenomic data
across body habitats from a large human population, we additionally
assessed the ecology of microbial metabolic and functional pathways
in these communities. We reconstructed the relative abundances of
pathways in community metagenomes22, which were much more
constant and evenly diverse than were organismal abundances
(Fig. 2b, see also Fig. 1), confirming this as an ecological property of
the entire human microbiome2. We were likewise able to determine
for the first time that taxonomic and functional alpha diversity across
microbial communities significantly correlate (Spearman of inverse
Simpson’s r 5 0.60, P 5 3.6 3 10267, n 5 661), the latter within a
more proscribed range of community configurations (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Unlike microbial taxa, several pathways were ubiquitous among
individuals and body habitats. The most abundant of these ‘core’
pathways include the ribosome and translational machinery, nucleotide charging and ATP synthesis, and glycolysis, and reflect the basics
of host-associated microbial life. Also in contrast to taxa, few pathways were highly variable among subjects within any body habitat;
exceptions included the Sec (orally, pathway relative abundance
s.d. 5 0.0052; total mean of oral standard deviations 5 0.0011 with
s.d. 5 0.0016) and Tat (globally, pathway s.d. 5 0.0055; mean of
global standard deviations 5 0.0023 with s.d. 5 0.0033) secretion systems, indicating a high degree of host–microbe and microbe–microbe
interactions in the healthy human microbiota. This high variability
was particularly present in the oral cavity; for phosphate, mono- and
di-saccharide, and amino acid transport in the mucosa; and also for
lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and spermidine/putrescine synthesis
and transport on the plaque and tongue ( 
HMMRC). The stability and high metagenomic abundance of this
housekeeping ‘core’ contrasts with the greater variability and lower
abundance of niche-specific functionality in rare but consistently
present pathways; for example, spermidine biosynthesis, methionine
degradation and hydrogen sulphide production, all examples highly
prevalent in gastrointestinal body sites (non-zero in .92% of
samples) but at very low abundance (median relative abundance
, 0.0052). This ‘long tail’ of low-abundance genes and pathways also
probably encodes much of the uncharacterized biomolecular function
and metabolism of these metagenomes, the expression levels of which
remain to be explored in future metatranscriptomic studies.
Protein families showed diversity and prevalence trends similar to
those of full pathways, ranging from maxima of only ,16,000 unique
families per community in the vagina to almost 400,000 in the oral
cavity (Fig. 1a, b; A remarkable fraction
of these families were indeed functionally uncharacterized, including
those detected by read mapping, with a minimum in the oral cavity
(mean 58% s.d. 6.8%) and maximum in the nares (mean 77% s.d.
11%). Likewise, many genes annotated from assemblies could not
be assigned a metabolic function, with a minimum in the vagina
(mean 78% s.d. 3.4%) and maximum in the gut (mean 86% s.d.
0.9%). The latter range did not differ substantially by body habitat
and is in close agreement with previous comprehensive gene catalogues
of the gut metagenome3. Taken together with the microbial variation
observed above throughout the human microbiome, functional variation among individuals might indicate pathways of particular importance in maintaining community structure in the face of personalized
immune, environmental or dietary exposures among these subjects.
Determining the functions of uncharacterized core and variable protein
families will be especially essential in understanding role of the microbiota in health and disease.
Correlations with host phenotype
We finally examined relationships associating both clades and
metabolism in the microbiota with host properties such as age,
gender, body mass index (BMI), and other available clinical metadata
(Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 3). Using a sparse multivariate
model, 960 microbial, enzymatic or pathway abundances were significantly associated with one or more of 15 subject phenotype and
sample metadata features. A wide variety of taxa, gene families and
metabolic pathways were differentially distributed with subject
ethnicity at every body habitat (Fig. 5a), representing the phenotype
with the greatest number (266 at false discovery rate (FDR) q , 0.2) of
total associations with the microbiome. Vaginal pH has also been
observed to correlate with microbiome composition9, and we detected
in this population both the expected reduction in Lactobacillus at high
pH and a corresponding increase in metabolic diversity (Fig. 5b).
Intriguingly, and not previously observed, subject age was most associated with a collection of highly differential metagenomically
encoded pathways on the skin (Fig. 5c), as well as shifts in skin clades
including retroauricular Firmicutes (P 5 1.0 3 1024, q 5 0.033). The
examples of associations with ethnicity and vaginal pH are among the
strongest associations with the microbiome, however, and most correlates (for example, with subject BMI, Fig. 5d) are more representatively modest. This lower degree of correlation held for most available
biometrics (gender, temperature, blood pressure, etc.), with even the
most significant associations possessing generally low effect sizes and
considerable unexplained variance. We conclude that most variation
in the human microbiome is not well explained by these phenotypic

metadata, and other potentially important factors such as short- and
long-term diet, daily cycles, founder effects such as mode of delivery,
and host genetics should be considered in future analyses.
Conclusions
This extensive sampling of the human microbiome across many subjects and body habitats provides an initial characterization of the
normal microbiota of healthy adults in a Western population. The
large sample size and consistent sampling of many sites from the same
individuals allows for the first time an understanding of the relationships
among microbes, and between the microbiome and clinical parameters,
that underpin the basis for individual variation—variation that may
ultimately be critical for understanding microbiome-based disorders.
Clinical studies of the microbiome will be able to leverage the resulting
extensive catalogues of taxa, pathways and genes1, although they must
also still include carefully matched internal controls. The uniqueness of
each individual’s microbiome even in this reference population argues
for future studies to consider prospective within-subjects designs where
possible. The HMP’s unique combination of organismal and functional
data across body habitats, encompassing both 16S and metagenomic
profiling, together with detailed characterization of each subject, has
allowed us and subsequent studies to move beyond the observation of
variabilityinthehumanmicrobiometoaskhowandwhythesemicrobial
communities vary so extensively.
Many details remain for further work to fill in, building on this
reference study. How do early colonization and lifelong change vary
among body habitats? Do epidemiological patterns of transmission of
beneficial or harmless microbes mirror patterns of transmission of
pathogens? Which co-occurrences among microbes reflect shared
response to the environment, as opposed to competitive or mutualistic
interactions? How large a role does host immunity or genetics play in
shaping patterns of diversity, and how do the patterns observed in this
NorthAmericanpopulationcomparetothosearoundtheworld?Future
studies building on the gene and organism catalogues established by the
Human Microbiome Project, including increasingly detailed investigations of metatranscriptomes and metaproteomes, will help to unravel
these open questions and allow us to more fully understand the links
between the human microbiome, health and disease.
METHODS SUMMARY
Microbiome samples were collected from up to 18 body sites at one or two time
points from 242 individuals clinically screened for absence of disease (K. Aagaard
et al., manuscript submitted). Samples were subjected to 16S ribosomal RNA gene
pyrosequencing (454 Life Sciences), and a subset were shotgun-sequenced for
metagenomics using the Illumina GAIIx platform1. 16S data processing and
