a b s t r a c t
Coronavirus disease 2019 has been recognized as a
global threat, and several studies are being conducted using
various mathematical models to predict the probable evolution of
this epidemic. These mathematical models based on various factors and analyses are subject to potential bias. Here, we propose a
simple econometric model that could be useful to predict the
spread of COVID-2019. We performed Auto Regressive Integrated
Moving Average (ARIMA) model prediction on the Johns Hopkins
epidemiological data to predict the epidemiological trend of the
prevalence and incidence of COVID-2019. For further comparison
or for future perspective, case deﬁnition and data collection have
to be maintained in real time.

1. Data description
The daily prevalence data of COVID-2019 from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected
from the ofﬁcial website of Johns Hopkins University ( 
opsdashboard/index.html), and Excel 2019 was used to build a time-series database . ARIMA
model was applied to a dataset consisting of 22 number determinations. Fig. 1 shows that the overall
prevalence of COVID-2019 presented an increasing trend that is reaching the epidemic plateau. The
difference between cases of one day and cases of the previous day D(Xn-Xn-1) showed a nonconstant
increase in the number of conﬁrmed cases. Descriptive analysis of the data was performed to evaluate
the incidence of new conﬁrmed cases of COVID-2019 and to prevent eventual bias.
2. Experimental design, materials, and methods
The ARIMA model includes autoregressive (AR) model, moving average (MA) model, and seasonal
autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model . The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) 
unit-root test helps in estimating whether the time series is stationary. Log transformation and differences are the preferred approaches to stabilize the time series . Seasonal and nonseasonal differences were used to stabilize the term trend and periodicity.
Parameters of the ARIMA model were estimated by autocorrelation function (ACF) graph and partial
autocorrelation (PACF) correlogram. To determine the prevalence of COVID-2019, ARIMA (1,0,4) was
selected as the best ARIMA model, while ARIMA (1,0,3) was selected as the best ARIMA model for
determining the incidence of COVID-2019. Gretl2019d statistical software was used to perform

Description of data collection
The daily prevalence data of COVID-2019 from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020
were collected from the ofﬁcial website of Johns Hopkins university ( 
maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html), and Excel 2019 was used to build a
time-series database. Descriptive analysis of the data was performed, and to evaluate
the incidence of new conﬁrmed cases of COVID-2019 and to prevent eventual bias, the
difference between the cases conﬁrmed on that day and the cases conﬁrmed on the
previous day were calculated D(Xn-Xn-1).

Value of the Data
 These data are useful because they provide a forecast for COVID-2019 epidemic, thus representing a valid and objective
tool for monitoring infection control.
 All institutions involved in public health and infection control can beneﬁt from these data because by using this model,
they can daily construct a reliable forecast for COVID-2019 epidemic.
 The additional value of these data lies in their easy collection and in the possibility to provide valid forecast for COVID-
2019 daily monitoring after the application of the ARIMA model.
 These data represent an easy way to evaluate the transmission dynamics of COVID-2019 to verify whether the strategy
plan for infection control or quarantine is efﬁcient.

statistical analysis on the prevalence and incidence datasets, and the statistical signiﬁcance level was
set at 0.05. A previous study was considered as reference for the methodology of the analysis .
Logarithmic transformation was performed to evaluate the inﬂuence of seasonality on the forecast.
The correlogram reporting the ACF and PACF showed that both prevalence and incidence of COVID-
2019 are not inﬂuenced by the seasonality. The forecast of prevalence and incidence data with relative 95% conﬁdence intervals are reported in Table 1.
Although more data are needed to have a more detailed prevision, the spread of the virus seems to
be slightly decreasing. Moreover, although the number of conﬁrmed cases is still increasing, the
incidence is slightly decreasing. If the virus does not develop new mutations, the number of cases
should reach a plateau (Figs. 1 and 2). The forecast and the estimate obtained are inﬂuenced by the
“case” deﬁnition and the modality of data collection. For further comparison or for future perspective,
case deﬁnition and data collection must be maintained in real time.
