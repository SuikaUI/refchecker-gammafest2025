To the Editor
High-throughput sequencing is revolutionizing microbial ecology studies. Efforts like the
Human Microbiome Projects1 and the US National Ecological Observatory Network2 are
helping us to understand the role of microbial diversity in habitats within our own bodies
and throughout the planet.
Pyrosequencing using error-correcting, sample-specific barcodes allows hundreds of
communities to be analyzed simultaneously in multiplex3. Integrating information from

thousands of samples, including those obtained from time series, can reveal large-scale
patterns that were inaccessible with lower-throughput sequencing methods. However, a
major barrier to achieving such insights has been the lack of software that can handle these
increasingly massive datasets. Although tools exist to perform library demultiplexing and
taxonomy assignment4,5, tools for downstream analyses are scarce.
Here we describe ‘quantitative insights into microbial ecology’ (QIIME; prounounced
‘chime’), an open-source software pipeline built using the PyCogent toolkit6, to address the
problem of taking sequencing data from raw sequences to interpretation and database
deposition. QIIME, available at supports a wide range of
microbial community analyses and visualizations that have been central to several recent
high-profile studies, including network analysis, histograms of within- or between-sample
diversity and analysis of whether ‘core’ sets of organisms are consistently represented in
certain habitats. QIIME also provides graphical displays that allow users to interact with the
data. Our implementation is highly modular and makes extensive use of unit testing to
ensure the accuracy of results. This modularity allows alternative components for
functionalities such as choosing operational taxonomic units (OTUs), sequence alignment,
inferring phylogenetic trees and phylogenetic and taxon-based analysis of diversity within
and between samples (including incorporation of third-party applications for many steps) to
be easily integrated and benchmarked against one another (Supplementary Fig. 1).
We applied the QIIME workflow to a combined analysis of previously collected data (see
Supplementary Discussion) for distal gut bacterial communities from conventionally raised
mice, adult human monozygotic and dizygotic twins and their mothers, and a time series
study of adult germ-free mice after they received human fecal microbiota (Fig. 1,
Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Discussion). This analysis combined ten full 454
FLX runs and one partial run, totalling 3.8 million bacterial 16S rRNA sequences from
previously published studies, including reads from different regions of the 16S rRNA gene.
QIIME is thus a robust platform for combining heterogeneous experimental datasets and for
rapidly obtaining new insights about various microbial communities. Because QIIME scales
to millions of sequences and can be used on platforms from laptops to high-performance
computing clusters, we expect it to keep pace with advances in sequencing technology and
to facilitate characterization of microbial community patterns ranging from normal
variations to pathological disturbances in many human, animal and other environmental
ecosystems.
