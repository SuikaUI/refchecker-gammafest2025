There is a growing interest in the development of new
therapeutic
strategies
for neurodegenerative disorders. In this article, a series
mono(catecholamine)
derivatives,
2,3-bis(hydroxy)-N-
(hydroxyacyl)benzamide, containing a pendant hydroxy, have
been synthesized and fully characterized by nuclear magnetic
resonance,
spectroscopy
mass spectrum. The thermodynamic stability of the chelators
with FeIII, MgII and ZnII ions was then investigated. The
chelators enable formation of (3 : 1) FeIII complexes with high
thermodynamic stability and exhibited improved selectivity
to FeIII ion. Meanwhile, the results of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl assays of mono(catecholamine) derivatives indicated
that they all possess excellent antioxidant properties. These
results support the hypothesis that the mono(catecholamine)
derivatives be used as high-afﬁnity chelator for iron overload
situations without depleting essential metal ions, such as MgII
and ZnII ions.

oxygen, loosely bound iron is able to redox cycle between the two stable oxidation states FeII and FeIII,
then catalyse the production of oxygen-derived free radicals, such as hydroxyl radical, which lead to
an increase in oxidative stress markers in the substantia nigra, an increase in dopamine turnover and
loss of dopamine in the striatum, α-synuclein pathology, and Lewy-body generation and membranal
degeneration in neurons , thereby inducing neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease
and Parkinson’s disease. Therefore, we needed to develop new iron chelators as novel promising
therapeutic strategies .
Over the decades, the design of hexadentate chelating agents for FeIII was inspired by siderophores
enterobactin, a natural microbial FeIII
chelating agent, which possesses favourable geometric
arrangement for FeIII coordination preference and highest pFeIII value . Lots of hexadentate
chelators were synthesized based on chelate moieties of siderophores, such as catecholamine ,
hydroxypyridinone , and hydroxamate . Most of these hexadentate chelators have a high
FeIII binding ability, but almost all chelating agents with high molecular weight (greater than 500), high
hydrogen bond donors (greater than 5) and high hydrogen bond acceptors (greater than 10), which
lead to a poor absorption, have not attracted more attention as potential therapeutic chelators. While
deferiprone is a very simple bidentate structure chelator which possesses low molecular weight (139),
low hydrogen bond donors (1) and low hydrogen bond acceptors (3) it satisﬁes design guidelines 
for good absorption. Hence, deferiprone has good oral activity, which has been a well-researched iron
chelating agent for the treatment of iron overload . After twenty years of clinical observations we
know that deferiprone can induce agranulocytosis . Therefore, we urgently needed to develop new
high afﬁnity, selective, orally and nontoxic iron chelators.
Catecholamine moiety possesses a high afﬁnity for FeIII. This extremely strong interaction with
tripositive metal cations results from the high electron density of both oxygen atoms . Therefore, an
iron chelating agent which satisﬁes design guidelines should be rationally designed, synthesized and
developed based on catecholamine moiety. The new mono(catecholamine) derivatives have structural
features that are unusual for a siderophore. It has a very simple bidentate structure unlike most known
siderophores. Meanwhile, it has a pendant hydroxide group, which makes the ligand very hydrophilic,
which is proposed to play an important role like ferrioxamine B and aminochelin (see ﬁgure 1 for
structure) with a pendant amine group .
In this study, we reported the synthesis of mono(catecholamine) derivatives, the solution
thermodynamic stability of these chelators with FeIII, MgII and ZnII ions in aqueous solution and
antioxidant activity.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of the bidentate chelator mono(catecholamine) derivatives 4a–c are shown in
2,3-bis(dibenzyloxy)benzonic
commercially
available 2,3-bis(hydroxyl)benzonic acid 1 . Aminoalcohol 3a–c and 2 were condensed using 1hydroxybenzotriazole/dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (HOBt/DCC) to obtain the desired benzamides 4a–c
with up to 90% yield . Deprotection of the hydroxyl groups under typical catalytic hydrogenation
conditions with removal of the benzyl group (room temperature, 130 ml min−1 H2, atmospheric pressure
and palladium on activated charcoal (Pd/C) in tetrahydrofuran) produced 5a–c (L1−3H2) with up to 99%

The mono(catecholamine) derivatives were fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (MNR),
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and mass spectrum (MS). The FTIR spectra of the
derivatives showed distinct absorption peaks at 1639–1647 cm−1 of benzamide carbonyl stretching
vibration, 1583–1593 and 1540–1548 cm−1 of benzene ring skeleton vibration. The 1H NMR signals of
the catecholamine aromatic protons of the chelators in (CD3)2CO were identiﬁed as doublets at 7.22–
7.28 ppm (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 1H, Ar–H), doublet of doublets at 6.96 ppm (dd, J = 7.8, 1.2 Hz, 1H, Ar–H) and
triplets at 6.69–6.71 ppm (t, J = 7.8 Hz, 1H, Ar–H). The signals of methylene of benzyl at 5.15–5.16 ppm (s,
9H, O–CH2–Ar) and 5.09–5.10 ppm (s, 9H, O–CH2–Ar) disappeared. Meanwhile, the 13C NMR signals
of methylene of benzyl also disappeared in the mono(catecholamine) derivatives. Results indicated that
the structure of mono(catecholamine) derivatives is as we expected.
2.2. Solution thermodynamics
In its neutral form, mono(catecholamine) derivatives (hereafter also designed as L1−3H2) have two
dissociable protons, corresponding to catecholamine moieties. Because catecholamine moieties require
deprotonation for efﬁcient metal chelation, their metal afﬁnity is necessarily pH dependent. In the
presence of dissolved metal ions (Ma+) and protonated chelator (LHi, where L is a chelator with i
removable protons), the pH-dependent metal–chelator complex with a general formula MmLlHh forms.
The relative amount of each species in solution is determined by equation (2.1), whose rearrangement
provides the standard formation constant notation of log βmlh (equation (2.2)). The log βmlh value
describes a cumulative formation constant. For convenience, these are discussed as stepwise association
constants, either for complex formation log K1n0 (equation (2.3)) or ligand protonation log K01 h (equation
(2.4)). When addressing protonation constants, the stepwise formation constants are commonly reported
as protonation constants (log KhH , h = 1, 2, 3, . . . ):

[M]m[L]l[H]h
log K01h = log
[LHh−1][H]
log K1n0 = log
[MLn−1][L]
The log KhH were determined from a combination of potentiometric and spectrophotometric titration.
The obtained data were analysed using HYPSPEC 2014 and HYPQUAD 2013 . The determined log
KhH of L1−3H2 and different phenolate type chelators are listed in table 1. All the chelators contain two
basic sites from the phenolate oxygen atoms of the catechol moieties. Therefore, L1−3H2 were both
treated as diprotic acids for data analysis. The potentiometric titration curves of L1−3H2 are shown
in ﬁgure 3, the a value is the mol ratio of added base per chelators. The deprotonation of phenolic
hydroxy in an orthoposition relative to amide gives rise to the buffer region at low pH (pH < 9.0),
and its inﬂection points at a = 1, which indicated the orthophenolic hydroxy complete dissociation.
These potentiometric titrations data were used to obtain the log K2H values, whereas spectrophotometric

titration data were required to accurately determine the higher log K1H values. The spectrophotometric
titration spectrogram of L1H2 was selected for illustration because it is similar to that of L2−3H2, as
shown in ﬁgure 4. The spectrograms of L2–3H2 are shown in the electronic supplementary material,
ﬁgures S1–S2. The initial absorbance peaks at 310 nm shifted to 330 nm with the increase of pH (5.3–9.0),
which was attributed to the deprotonation of the phenolic hydroxy in an orthoposition relative to amide.
Subsequently, the peaks width gradually broadened, and the intensity was gradually decreasing with
the increase of pH (9.0–12.5), which was attributed to the further deprotonation. At pH 9.0, about 90%
of L1−3H2 are in anionic form (L1−3H)−(ﬁgure 5 and electronic supplementary material, ﬁgures S3–S4),
which indicated one more lost acidic proton of catechol moiety.
The values log K2H of L1−3H2 are ascribed to the protonations of the oxygen atoms of the
catecholamine dianions in an ortho position relative to amide. The values log K2H of L1−3H2 were
comparable with the corresponding values for N-methyl-2,3-dihydroxybenzamide (MDHB) , N,Ndimethyl-2,3-dihydroxybenzamide (DMB) and catechol (table 1). The results in this working
were in good agreement with the value of log K2H = 7.50 for MDHB. At the same time, the values
were about one logarithm unit lower than those of DMB, which was attributed to an intramolecular
hydrogen bond of the secondary amide with ortho position phenolate oxygen moiety
and the negative inductive effect of tertiary amide in catecholamine moiety. Meanwhile, the values
were about two logarithm units lower than those of catechol, which not only was attributed to an
intramolecular hydrogen bond , but also the inductive effect of the secondary amide. In fact,

The spectrophotometric titration spectrogram of the FeIII–L1H2 complex was selected for illustration
because it is similar to that of L2−3H2, as shown in ﬁgure 6. The spectrograms of L2–3H2 are
shown in the electronic supplementary material, ﬁgures S5–S6. In the titration spectrogram, intense
ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) bands of the FeIII complexes allow the proton-dependent
equilibria to be monitored spectrophotometrically. All of the chelator L1−3H2 possess at least three
spectrophotometrically distinguishable species that can be assigned by comparison to the well-deﬁned
FeIII–catechol system . For the sake of clarity, we will use the FeLn notation to ignore the charge
state of the complexes, which varies across our series of chelator. In all cases, a light green solution was
observed under acidic conditions, corresponding to FeL forms. Upon addition of alkali, a blue solution
was observed, which is indicative of FeL2 predominates. The solution converts, under more alkaline
conditions, to red that is assigned as FeL3. So, we proposed the complexation processes are that complete
deprotonation bidentate gradually replaced solvent molecules with the increased pH value (ﬁgure 7).
The speciﬁc species and the LMCT band wavelengths with their corresponding extinction coefﬁcients
for each FeLn spectral are compiled in table 2.
The afﬁnities of chelator L1−3H2 with metal ions were determined by spectrophotometric titration
data, which were analysed using the program HYPSPEC 2014 . The species distribution diagrams
of metal-complexes were obtained using the simulation program HYSS . The species distribution
diagrams of FeIII complexes are shown in ﬁgure 8 and the electronic supplementary material, ﬁgures S7–
S8. The log βmlh of L1−3H2 with FeIII are listed in table 3. But, log βmlh values are species dependent,
therefore, a species-independent metric is needed to compare metal afﬁnities of various ligands. In
this regard, pM is the metric employed, where pM = −log[Mfree]. ‘Mfree’ refers to solvated metal
ions free of complexation by ligands or hydroxides; high pM corresponds to low concentrations of
uncomplexed metal ions in the solution. In this study, pM values are calculated using standard conditions
of [M] = 10−6 M, [L] = 10−5 M and pH = 7.4. The pFeIII values of chelator L1−3H2 and related compounds
are listed in table 3. The pFeIII values of the chelator L1−3H2 are signiﬁcantly higher than those of
deferiprone and aminochelin . Meanwhile, changes in minor log KiH values are an insigniﬁcant
factor in determining FeIII afﬁnity in chelators L1−3H2, the higher afﬁnity of L1H2 is presumably owing
to favourable geometric arrangement between the ligand and the FeIII coordination preference. The fact

that the pFeIII value of L1H2 is higher than that of L2−3H2 indicated a shorter pendant hydroxide group
with lesser steric hindrance, which favours higher FeIII afﬁnity.
Metal afﬁnity studies have focused on the FeIII ion; however, the presence of MgII and ZnII ions in
biological systems leads us to evaluate the afﬁnity of the chelators with MgII and ZnII ions. The MgII
and ZnII ions afﬁnities of L1−3H2 were determined through spectrophotometric titrations under the
same conditions above. The spectrophotometric titration spectrograms of MgII–L1−3H2 and ZnII–L1−3H2
complexes are shown in the electronic supplementary material, ﬁgures S9–S14. The log βmlh, pMgII and

The pMgII and pZnII values of L1−3H2 were signiﬁcantly lower than those of the efﬁcient chelator
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) . The low pMgII and pZnII values were similar to those
of catechol chelators , indicating the formation of chelators L1−3H2 with weak MgII and ZnII
afﬁnity, as predicted.
2.3. Antioxidant activity
1,1-Diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) is a stable free radical , which is widely used to monitor the
free radical scavenging ability of various antioxidants . The assays were carried out in methanol,
and the results were expressed as EC50, which represented the antioxidant concentration required to
decrease the initial DPPH concentration by 50%. Low EC50 values indicate a highly radical scavenging
capacity. This parameter is widely used to measure antioxidant capacity but does not consider the
reaction time. The time needed to reach the steady state to the concentration corresponding at EC50
(TEC50) was calculated, and antiradical efﬁciency (AE) was introduced as a parameter to characterize
antioxidant compounds . AE was determined by the following equation:
EC50 × TEC50
The EC50 value of antioxidant L1−3H2 and their FeIII complexes were obtained from the curves of the
percentage of remaining DPPH at the steady state against the concentration n, where n is the molar ratio
of antioxidant to DPPH (mol AH/mol DPPH). The percentage of remaining DPPH was determined from
the kinetic curves of different concentrations n, ﬁgure 9 and electronic supplementary material, ﬁgures
S15–S19. The EC50 and AE values of L1−3H2, complexes FeIII–L1−3H2, (BHA) butylated hydroxyanisole,
catechol and ascorbic acid are listed in table 3 (aAntioxidant. bBHA and ascorbic acid in Ref. .
cCatechol in Ref. ).
The structures of phenolic derivatives have great inﬂuence on antioxidant activity . L1−3H2,
BHA and catechol possess similar bisphenolic structures, which lead them with approximate EC50
For the results of L1−3H2 and FeIII–L1−3H2, the increase in AE values can be explained by mechanism
of the DPPH’s reaction with phenols (ArOH). The antioxidant capacity of antioxidant L1−3H2 was
inﬂuenced by amide group and coordination reaction. DPPH reacted with ArOH through an electrontransfer process from ArOH or its phenoxide anion (ArO−) to DPPH (electron transfer mechanism) .
The electron-transfer process from ArO−to DPPH was fast. The presence of amide group in L1−3H2
increased the quantity of ArO−and the observed values of the reaction rate, which conferred high AE
values. The AE values of the complexes FeIII–L1−3H2 reduce generally, the FeIII coordination reaction
produced acids and ArO–M complex. The acids and coordination reaction all reduced the quantity of
ArO−and antioxidant capacity. The results were as expected.

3. Conclusion
In this article, a series of mono(catecholamine) derivatives, 2,3-bis(hydroxy)-N-(hydroxyacyl)benzamide,
containing a pendant hydroxy, were synthesized and fully characterized. The results of thermodynamic
stability with a set of metal ions showed that the chelators possess with high thermodynamic
stability and exhibited improved selectivity to the FeIII ion. Meanwhile, the results of DPPH assays
of mono(catecholamine) derivatives indicated they all possess excellent antioxidant properties. These
results also indicated that mono(catecholamine) derivatives have a potential application prospect as
chelator for the iron overload situations without depletion of essential metal ions such as MgII and
ZnII ions.

4.3. Titration solution and methods
An INESA ZDJ-4B automatic potential titrator was used to measure the pH of the experimental solutions.
Meanwhile, it was used for incremental additions of base standard solution to the titration cup under N2
atmosphere. Titrations were performed in 0.10 M KCl supporting electrolyte. The temperature of the
experimental solution was maintained at 298.2 K by an externally thermostat water bath. UV–visible
spectra for incremental titrations and batch titrations were recorded on a Thermo Scientiﬁc Evolution
201 UV–vis spectrophotometer. Solid reagents were weighed on a Sartorius BT25S analytical balance
accurate to 0.01 mg. All titration solutions were prepared using distilled water from Ulupure ULUP-
IV ultra water system and degassed by an ultrasonic device. Standard solution of 0.10 M KOH and
HNO3 were purchased from Aladdin. Chelator stock solutions were made by dissolving a weighed
amount of chelator accurate to 0.01 mg in 0.10 M KCl supporting electrolyte in a volumetric ﬂask. A stock
solution of 2.5 × 10−3 M metal ion (FeIII, MgII and ZnII ions) was made by dissolving a weighed amount
of corresponding metal salt (FeCl3, ZnCl2 and MgCl2 · 6H2O 99.95% metals basis) in 1.0 vol % HNO3
standard solution. FeIII ion titrations were conducted with a 3 : 1 chelator : metal ratio. MgII and ZnII

ions titrations were conducted with a 1 : 1 chelator : metal ratio. Metal-to-chelator ratios were controlled
by careful addition of a chelator solution of known concentration and a metal ion stock solution to the
titration cup. All titrations were repeated a minimum of three times.
4.4. Titration and treatment
Spectrophotometric titration data were analysed using the program HYPSPEC 2014 , using nonlinear
least-squares regression to determine formation constants. Wavelengths between 400–800 nm of FeIII
titration curves and 250–550 nm of MgII, ZnII titration curves were used for data reﬁnement. The
number of absorbing species to be reﬁned upon was determined by factor analysis within the HYPSPEC
2014 . Speciation diagrams were generated using HYSS titration simulation software. The
protonation constants and metal complex formation constants were determined by potentiometric and
spectrophotometric titration experiments.
4.5. Antioxidant assay methods
An aliquot of methanol (0.1 ml) and different aliquot stock methanol solutions of 1.0 × 10−4 M
antioxidant were added to the 2.5 ml methanol solution of 6.0 × 10−5 M DPPH, and the volume was
adjusted to a ﬁnal value of 3.0 ml with methanol. Absorbances at 517 nm were measured immediately at
10 s intervals on a Thermo Scientiﬁc Evolution 201 UV–vis spectrophotometer until the reaction reached
steady state. Five different concentrations were measured for each assay. Then the EC50 were plotted
to obtain from the graph the percentage of remaining DPPH at the steady state against the molar ratio
antioxidant to DPPH. Moreover, the time needed to reach the steady state to EC50 concentration (TEC50)
and the AE values was also calculated.
