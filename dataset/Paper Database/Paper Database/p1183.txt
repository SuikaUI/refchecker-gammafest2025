A large proportion of functional sequence within mammalian genomes falls outside protein-coding exons and can be
transcribed into long RNAs. However, the roles in mammalian biology of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) are not well
understood. Few lncRNAs have experimentally determined roles, with some of these being lineage-specific. Determining
the extent by which transcription of lncRNA loci is retained or lost across multiple evolutionary lineages is essential if we are
to understand their contribution to mammalian biology and to lineage-specific traits. Here, we experimentally investigated
the conservation of lncRNA expression among closely related rodent species, allowing the evolution of DNA sequence to be
uncoupled from evolution of transcript expression. We generated total RNA (RNAseq) and H3K4me3-bound (ChIPseq) DNA
data, and combined both to construct catalogues of transcripts expressed in the adult liver of Mus musculus domesticus
(C57BL/6J), Mus musculus castaneus, and Rattus norvegicus. We estimated the rate of transcriptional turnover of lncRNAs and
investigated the effects of their lineage-specific birth or death. LncRNA transcription showed considerably greater gain and
loss during rodent evolution, compared with protein-coding genes. Nucleotide substitution rates were found to mirror the
in vivo transcriptional conservation of intergenic lncRNAs between rodents: only the sequences of noncoding loci with
conserved transcription were constrained. Finally, we found that lineage-specific intergenic lncRNAs appear to be associated
with modestly elevated expression of genomically neighbouring protein-coding genes. Our findings show that nearly half of
intergenic lncRNA loci have been gained or lost since the last common ancestor of mouse and rat, and they predict that
such rapid transcriptional turnover contributes to the evolution of tissue- and lineage-specific gene expression.

Introduction
The mammalian transcriptome has recently been shown to be
surprisingly diverse in its extent and encoded functions ,
much of which are noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) as they are not
translated into proteins. The ability to sequence the entire
transcriptome in an unbiased manner has not only allowed more
complete characterization of well described and highly abundant
noncoding RNAs with known function, such as transfer RNAs,
small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs and ribosomal RNAs,
but have also revealed additional ncRNA species. For example, a
number of long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) larger than 200 nucleotides
(nt) have been discovered . Many lncRNA loci are
intergenic, when transcription occurs wholly within the genomic
intervals between two adjacent protein-coding genes . Some
lncRNAs can be transcribed divergently from a neighbouring
protein-coding transcript using identical or almost identical
transcriptional initiation complexes . In addition, lncRNAs
overlapping with protein-coding genes can be transcribed from
either strand .
Although the precise roles of many lncRNAs remain unknown,
in general they are thought to act in transcriptional regulation
 . LncRNAs can regulate gene expression programs
through a variety of mechanisms, including interactions with
chromatin remodelling complexes or transcription factors .
Consistent with a cis-regulatory role, co-expression of intergenic
lncRNA loci with their neighbouring protein-coding genes has
been observed and a number of intergenic lncRNAs have
demonstrated roles in regulating the expression of genes in their
genomic vicinity . Some intergenic lncRNAs appear to regulate

the expression of both neighbouring and distal genes .
Indeed, many intergenic lncRNAs have been experimentally
demonstrated to have roles in regulating transcription of distally
located targets, in trans . Nevertheless, the exact proportion
and the distinguishing features of cis- and trans-acting intergenic
lncRNAs remain unknown.
If lncRNAs’ functional roles are conserved it is expected that

preserved.
transcripts and promoters of mammalian intergenic lncRNAs
exhibit signatures of selective constraint: their promoters are
highly conserved across vertebrates and they have accumulated
fewer substitutions than neighbouring putative neutral sequence
 . However little is yet known of the evolutionary persistence
of lncRNA transcription. Generally the loss and gain of functional
noncoding sequence can occur rapidly, with approximately half of
all functional ancestral nucleotides predicted to have been gained
or lost in mouse or rat since their common ancestor . Other
noncoding RNAs, in particular tRNAs, have been shown to
exhibit rapid turnover of their transcribed loci, despite conservation of their function . Turnover of regulatory elements
underlies species-specific transcriptional evolution and may be
associated with phenotypic changes .
Only a small minority of intergenic lncRNAs in mouse or
human were found to have transcribed orthologous sequences in
transcribed loci, or it might imply that intergenic lncRNAs, which
are often lowly expressed and tissue specific , have
transcribed
orthologous
undetected.
Indeed, analysis of the transcription of three intergenic lncRNA
loci across homologous regions of the mammalian and avian brain
revealed that some intergenic lncRNAs can have conserved
expression patterns .
To resolve the extent of lncRNA transcriptional turnover it is
comparison
transcription in homogeneous and homologous tissues. Achieving
this in closely related species also allows the distinction of
transcriptional turnover from DNA sequence turnover and
furthermore might reveal otherwise unexpected mechanisms of
regulatory divergence. Here we experimentally and computationally explored the genetic structure and function of lncRNA loci in
matched tissues from three closely related rodent species, Mus
musculus domesticus (C57BL/6J), Mus musculus castaneus and Rattus
norvegicus.
Combining RNAseq and chromatin status to identify long
noncoding RNAs in mouse liver
We identified transcripts expressed in the liver of three young
adult male Mus musculus domesticus (inbred strain C57BL/6J termed
hereafter Mmus) individuals by directional, stranded ribosomal
RNA (rRNA)-depleted transcriptome sequencing (total RNAseq)
(Figure 1A) (see Materials and Methods). Data from three
independent biological replicates were pooled. About 80% of
sequencing reads were mapped to the reference Mmus
(mm9) genome and liver gene expression was detectable for
61% of all UTRs and coding exons annotated in the mouse
genome (coverage: 66%). We found that a substantial fraction of
sequencing reads map to unannotated, likely noncoding, loci
consistent with previous results .
Using our total transcriptome sequencing data we assembled de
transcripts
(Figure 1A). As a consequence of the short-read single end nature
of our data, our transcripts can be fragmented due to incomplete
coverage of the full-length cDNA. To identify independent
transcripts, we performed genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIPseq) against trimethylation
of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3), which marks the beginning
of actively transcribed genes and identified enriched regions
 (Figure 1A) (see Materials and Methods).
We intersected the genomic locations of 18303 H3K4me3
enriched regions with the predicted 59 end of our RNAseq-defined
Mmus transcripts longer than 200 bases in length, thereby
predicting
transcription
(Figure 1A). As found in previous studies, we identified a limited
number of protein-coding genes that exhibited evidence of
bidirectional transcription at their TSS (Figure S1, Table S10)
 . Most of these transcribed regions are likely noncoding and
are not further addressed in our study except when supported by a
de novo assembled noncoding transcript .
Similarly, we identified transcripts that were either intergenic
(n = 388) or intragenic (n = 8527) based on their overlap with
Mmus protein-coding gene annotations (Figure 1A) (see Materials
Intergenic

protein-coding
potential were annotated as long intergenic ncRNAs
(intergenic lncRNAs) (n = 316, Table S3). Next we defined
transcribed loci as clusters of one or more transcripts with
overlapping exonic or intronic nucleotides. From 293 of these loci
only intergenic lncRNA transcripts were expressed (Table S3 and
S4). The vast majority (n = 233) of these intergenic lncRNA loci
have no overlap with intergenic lncRNAs annotated in the mouse
genome by Ensembl (build 64), demonstrating that current mouse
intergenic lncRNA catalogues are largely incomplete . Mmus
liver intergenic lncRNAs transcripts were significantly (two-tailed
Mann-Whitney test, typically p,161024) found to be: (i) more
lowly expressed, (ii) shorter and (iii) to have fewer exons than their
protein-coding transcript counterparts (Table S2) consistent with
previous reports .
The second group of 7289 intragenic loci comprises 8527
transcripts overlapping protein-coding genes (Ensembl build 60,
Author Summary
The best-understood portion of mammalian genomes
contains genes transcribed into RNAs, which are subsequently translated into proteins. These genes are generally
under high selective pressure and deeply conserved
between species. Recent publications have revealed novel
classes of genes, which are also transcribed into RNA but
are not subsequently translated into proteins. One such
novel class are long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). LncRNA loci
are controlled in a similar manner to protein-coding genes,
yet are more often expressed tissue-specifically, and their
conservation and function(s) are mostly unknown. Previous reports suggest that lncRNAs can affect the expression
of nearby protein-coding genes or act at a distance to
control broader biological processes. Also, lncRNA sequence is poorly conserved between mammals compared
with protein-coding genes, but how rapidly their transcription evolves, particularly between closely related
species, remains unknown. By comparing lncRNA expression between homologous tissues in two species of mouse
and in rat, we discovered that lncRNA genes are ‘‘born’’ or
‘‘die’’ more rapidly than protein-coding genes and that this
rapid evolution impacts the expression levels of nearby
coding genes. This local regulation of gene expression
reveals a functional role for the rapid evolution of lncRNAs,
which may contribute to biological differences between

Table S3 and S4). Forty-nine loci have overlapping antisense
RNAs transcribed from the opposite strand and marked by
separate H3K4me3 enriched regions indicating independent
transcriptional initiation (Table S9). Examples in this category
include the constitutively expressed noncoding RNA Kcnq1ot1
lncRNAs show spatio-temporal expression patterns in
Most protein-coding genes are expressed in multiple tissues .
In contrast, lncRNA expression tends to be spatially and temporally
restricted . We validated the expression of 15 randomly
selected liver expressed intergenic lncRNA transcripts by quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in seven Mmus adult tissues (Figure 1B) and
nine intragenic antisense lncRNA transcripts by strand specific RTqPCR in four adult tissues (Figure S2D). These tissues were
chosen because they show different degrees of cell type complexity
and biological functionality. We found that the large majority of the
tested intergenic and intragenic antisense lncRNA transcripts are
predominately expressed in liver.
Large changes in gene expression are observed during tissue
development . In order to identify whether the intergenic
lncRNAs we identified are developmentally regulated during
hepatocyte
differentiation,
representative lncRNAs by RT-qPCR at embryonic stages E10,
E12, E14 and E18 and adult stage P62. Our data showed that
lncRNAs are also extremely specific to the adult developmental
stage of liver. In summary, the intergenic lncRNAs we identify are

(Figure 1C).
Collection of matched long noncoding RNAs in
castaneus and rat
Sequence comparison of mouse intergenic lncRNAs and their
human and rat orthologous sequence have shown that these
transcripts tend to be constrained, an evolutionary hallmark of
functionality, albeit at much lower levels than protein-coding
genes . However little is yet known about transcriptional
turnover of lncRNA during evolution. To address the transcriptional turnover of lncRNAs, we explored their transcription across
three rodents. In addition to Mmus, we studied transcript
expression in the adult liver of a closely related mouse Mus
musculus castaneus (CAST/EiJ termed Mcas) and in the rat (Rattus
norvegicus, termed Rnor) (Figure 2). The two mouse subspecies,

Mmus and Mcas, diverged about one million years ago (MYA) and
last shared a common ancestor with Rnor about 13 to 19 MYA
 (Figure 2A). These differences in species separation across
evolutionary time allowed us to take two snapshots of transcriptional turnover during rodent evolution, using the closest wildderived mouse species (Mcas) to Mmus that is commercially
available and Rnor as the evolutionary nearest rodent species with
a well-annotated genome. Similar to the characterization of
transcripts in Mmus liver, we performed RNAseq and H3K4me3
ChIPseq experiments in Mcas and Rnor, and identified 158 and
605 intergenic lncRNAs respectively (Tables S1, S5, S6, S7, S8).
The observed difference between the numbers of annotated
intergenic lncRNA loci across the three rodents (293, 158 and 605
for Mmus, Mcas and Rnor, respectively) can be either due to
experimental bias or underlying biology. To test the contribution
of the difference in read number of each species RNAseq library
(Table S1), we reassembled transcripts in Mmus and Rnor after
randomly selecting from Mmus and Rnor libraries the same
number of reads as Mcas, our smallest library (Table S1). For each
species we repeated this procedure 10 times. By comparing the
numbers of intergenic lncRNAs in Mmus or Rnor that overlapped
a transcript from these recreated libraries, we found that the
differences in numbers of lncRNAs between mice (Mmus and
Mcas) species are mostly due to the depth of sequencing. After
adjusting the read number of the Mmus RNAseq library to the
Mcas RNAseq library, we identified a mean of 154 intergenic
lncRNA loci (standard deviation = 3.4) for Mmus, a similar
number to the one assembled in Mcas (n = 158), suggesting that
the difference in the number of lncRNA loci is due to an
experimental bias. In contrast, in Rnor, using the same number of
sequencing reads the reduction approach afforded a mean of 284
intergenic lncRNA loci (standard deviation = 5.9). This number
corresponds to a 80% rise over the 158 Mcas intergenic lncRNA
loci and indicates that there is an increase of liver lncRNA loci in
the rat lineage.
Rapid turnover of lncRNA transcription
We next considered if during rodent evolution lncRNA loci
were conserved in their transcription in a similar manner to
protein-coding genes. We defined transcriptional turnover as
instances of genomic loci for which syntenic sequence is conserved
between two or more species yet transcription of this conserved
sequence is not. To determine conservation of transcribed loci, we
combined H3K4me3 peaks with RNA sequencing reads overlapping (by more than 1 bp) the syntenic regions to create a stringent
set of conserved loci (see Materials and Methods). These loci show
evidence of both transcriptional initiation and transcript formation. Owing to the availability of its larger number of publicly
available genome wide resources, such as spatial and temporal
expression patterns , we anchored our analysis on Mmus. To
allow differentiation between sequence and transcriptional turnover we only considered Mmus loci that have aligned orthologous
sequence in the rat genome [intergenic lncRNA loci n = 268
(91.5%), protein-coding loci n = 6723 (92.2%)].
We then classified mouse loci according to their transcriptional
conservation into three classes: those specific to Mmus, if evidence
of expression was found only in Mmus; those conserved in Mus
genus, when evidence of transcription was found in Mmus and
Mcas but not in Rnor; and, those conserved across these rodents,
when expression evidence was found in Mmus, Mcas and Rnor
(Figure 2A, Table S4). Our definition does not explicitly take into
conservation
exon-intron
structure.
H3K4me3 and RNAseq signals were grouped according to our
classification (Figure 2B–2C).
In order to confirm that the observed differences were not solely
a consequence of biases introduced by sequencing depth, we
validated our interspecies comparisons by semi-quantitative RT-
PCR in independent biological replicates from adult livers of
Mmus, Mcas and Rnor for 24 intergenic lncRNA transcripts from
four categories (rodent conserved, Mus genus conserved, Mmusspecific, and Rnor-specific, Figure S3). These RT-PCR results
confirmed that our global approach accurately identifies speciesand lineage-specific intergenic lncRNAs.
Turnover of transcription is considerably more frequent for
intergenic lncRNA loci than for protein-coding genes in the rodent
liver (Figure 2D). A significantly smaller fraction of intergenic
lncRNA than protein-coding loci exhibit conserved transcription
across rodents [intergenic lncRNA loci n = 160 (59.7%), proteincoding loci n = 6169 (91.7%), two-tailed Fisher’s exact test,
p,1023]. Conversely, a significantly higher proportion of intergenic lncRNA than protein-coding loci are specific to the Mmus
lineage [intergenic lncRNA loci n = 30 (11.2%), protein-coding
loci n = 75 (1.1%), two-tailed Fisher’s exact test, p,1023].
The difference in sequencing depth between the three species
influenced the number of annotated intergenic lncRNAs. To
account for this effect and provide a more conservative estimate of
transcriptional conservation we considered the set of intragenic
and lncRNA loci that were assembled after adjusting the Mmus
and Rnor RNAseq library sizes to that of Mcas (see Materials and
Methods). Intragenic and intergenic lncRNA loci were annotated
as previously. We considered a Mmus locus to have conserved
expression if it had an overlapping H3K4me3 peak and an
overlapping transcript (.1 bp). As previously, we found proteincoding gene loci to be more often conserved in rodents (1326/
2415, 55%) than intergenic lncRNA loci (31/110, 28%, two-tailed
Fisher’s exact test, p,1023).
Next we aimed to gain initial insights into the conservation of
exon-intron structures of Mmus intergenic lncRNAs. For mouse
intergenic lncRNAs and protein-coding loci whose transcription
was conserved in rat (160 and 6169 loci, respectively) we
compared the coverage by RNAseq reads of mouse exonic
nucleotides in the rat orthologous regions. We found that rodent
conserved protein-coding transcripts have a significantly higher
coverage (median 78%) than intergenic lncRNA (median 47%,
two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p,2610216, Figure S4). This
observation can be a consequence of lower coverage of low
abundance transcripts and/or lower conservation of exon-intron
structure for intergenic lncRNAs.
Similarly, we observed that the transcriptional conservation of
noncoding transcripts that overlap
protein-coding genes in
antisense orientation also showed a rapid decay across rodent
evolution. Only 36% of the Mus conserved intragenic antisense
transcripts are expressed in Rnor (Figure S2). These results
indicate that the large majority of ncRNAs are conserved in the
Mus genus but not in the evolutionarily further distant species
Rnor. The apparent low conservation of intragenic antisense
transcription is consistent with previous conservation analysis .
To investigate transcriptional turnover of intergenic lncRNAs
beyond the rodent lineage, we used publicly available polyA+
transcriptome sequencing data for the adult human liver (Human
BodyMap 2.0 RNAseq data). Rodents and human shared a
common ancestor over 90 MYA . We considered in this
analysis only Mmus transcripts whose expression was supported by
at least one overlapping polyA+ sequencing read . We found
that the majority of mouse intergenic lncRNA loci overlap polyA+
reads (273/293 loci), suggesting that few intergenic lncRNA loci
assembled here transcribe only non-polyadenylated transcripts.
We discarded 1368 (18.8%) protein-coding and 159 (58.2%)

intergenic
orthologous sequence in the human or rat genome . As
observed for the rodent lineage, a significantly smaller fraction of
Mmus intergenic lncRNA than protein-coding genes orthologous
in humans are expressed in the liver [intergenic lncRNA loci
(n = 76, 56.7%), protein-coding loci (n = 5689, 96.1%), two-tailed
Fisher’s exact test, p,1023) (Figure S5). Our data indicate that the
fraction of liver transcribed mouse intergenic lncRNAs expressed
in the orthologous region of the human genome is two-fold higher
(two-tailed Fisher’s exact test, p,1023) than prior estimates ,
which supports the use of homologous tissue types to investigate
levels of transcriptional conservation of tissue specific transcripts,

such as intergenic lncRNAs. We conclude that rapid turnover of
intergenic lncRNAs is not restricted to the rodent lineage, but is
widespread among eutherian mammals.
Sequence constraint is associated with conservation of
intergenic lncRNA transcription
Next we examined how sequence constraint reflects transcriptional conservation of intergenic lncRNA and protein-coding loci.
For each transcript we considered its most 59 nucleotide to
correspond to the transcriptional start site and defined its
promoter as the 400 nucleotides upstream of this site. We
compared the mouse-rat nucleotide substitution rate for intergenic
lncRNA loci (dloci) and promoters (dpromoter), to rates for genomically
neighbouring and non-overlapping ancestral repeats [ARs (dAR)]
with matched G+C content . ARs are transposable
element-derived sequences that were present in the last common
ancestor of human and mouse; most of these sequences have been
observed to evolve neutrally and hence provide reliable proxies for
local neutral mutation rates . We first confirmed that Mmus
liver-expressed intergenic lncRNA loci accumulated mutations at a
significantly slower rate than adjacent neutral sequence (Figure
S6A) (dloci = 0.148, dAR = 0.164, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test,
p,361027). In line with this observation, long sequence segments
that have preferentially purged insertions or deletions in Mmus
and Rnor lineages were 1.6-fold enriched in intergenic lncRNA
transcription over expected levels (permutation test, p,1023) .
As previously reported the sequences of intergenic
lncRNA loci evolve more rapidly than those of full-length
protein-coding loci (Figure S6B) (dloci/dAR = 0.902; protein-coding
dloci/dAR = 0.857;
two-tailed
Mann-Whitney
p,261023).
Additionally, the putative core promoters of intergenic lncRNAs
accumulated significantly more substitutions than those of proteincoding genes (Figure S6C) (intergenic lncRNA dpromoter/dAR = 0.843;
protein-coding dpromoter/dAR = 0.746, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test,
p,261025). The discrepancy between this result and published
findings is likely due to the incompleteness of lncRNA
transcripts’ 59 ends and thus to incomplete delineation of lncRNA
promoter sequences.
To determine whether loss of transcription is associated with
loss of sequence constraint, we compared Mmus to Rnor
nucleotide substitution rates between two groups of intergenic
lncRNAs: those specific to the Mus genus (Mmus and Mcas) and
those conserved among these rodents (Mmus, Mcas and Rnor).
Rodent conserved intergenic lncRNA loci show evidence for
purifying selection on both transcribed (two-tailed Mann-Whitney
test, p,4610210) (Figure 3A) and putative promoter sequences
(two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p,3610212) (Figure 3B). Intergenic lncRNA loci transcribed in the Mus genus but not in Rnor,
exhibit no constraint in transcribed regions (two-tailed Mann-
Whitney test, p.0.2) (Figure 3A). Mus genus-conserved putative
core promoters accumulated significantly fewer substitutions than
neighbouring putatively neutral sequence (median dprom = 0.151
and dAR = 0.165, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p,561023)
suggesting they evolved under purifying selection (Figure 3B).
Negative selective pressure was significantly higher on the
promoters of loci with rodent conserved transcription than on
promoter sequence with Mus genus-specific transcription (rodent
conserved median dprom/dAR = 0.783, Mus genus-specific median
dprom/dAR = 0.901, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p,761023).
We asked whether the observed low degree of sequence
constraint on intergenic lncRNA loci, relative to protein-coding
genes, was due to rapid transcriptional turnover of a subset
of intergenic lncRNAs. To test this, we compared Mmus to
Rnor nucleotide substitution rates for the transcribed sequences
(including exons and introns) between the subset of intergenic
lncRNA loci exhibiting conserved expression in the rodent liver
(n = 160) with the corresponding set of protein-coding genes
(n = 6641) and found no significant difference (intergenic lncRNA
dloci/dAR = 0.827, protein-coding dloci/dAR = 0.842 two-tailed Mann-
Whitney test, p.0.58) (Figure S7A). For loci conserved in rodents,
nucleotide substitution rates of intronic and exonic sequence were
compared between Mmus and Rnor. Introns (dintron) of proteincoding genes and intergenic lncRNAs evolved at comparable rates
(intergenic
dintron/dAR = 0.959,
protein-coding
dAR = 0.986, two-tailed
Mann-Whitney test, p.0.28) (Figure
S7C). In contrast, protein-coding gene exons evolve under strong
purifying selection (intergenic lncRNA dexon/dAR = 0.805, proteincoding dexon/dAR = 0.484, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p,10215)
(Figure S7B) likely to ensure the maintenance of their coding
potential during evolution.
Our results therefore indicate that intergenic lncRNA loci that
were gained or lost in recent Mus evolution evolved neutrally
between mouse and rat. Conversely, rodent conserved intergenic
lncRNAs have accumulated fewer substitutions than neighbouring
neutral sequence indicating that conservation of transcription is
reflected in sequence constraint.
Intergenic lncRNA loci tend to lie adjacent to proteincoding genes with liver function
Mammalian intergenic lncRNA loci and their genomically
adjacent protein-coding genes show a significant tendency to
exhibit similar spatiotemporal expression profiles .
We found intergenic lncRNA transcription in liver occurs
significantly more frequently near to protein-coding genes that
are expressed in the liver than expected by chance (see
Materials and Methods; 1.6-fold; permutation test, p,561023).
Complementary results were obtained using Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) tissue
annotation categories (Figure S8) . About 30% of the proteincoding genes closer to intergenic lncRNA loci were classified as
liver expressed (p,361025).
Lineage-specific intergenic lncRNA expression is
associated with increased transcription of adjacent
protein-coding genes
We considered whether lineage-specific transcription of intergenic lncRNAs might associate with the expression level of
genomically adjacent protein-coding genes (see Materials and
Methods). If intergenic lncRNAs have no effect on nearby proteincoding gene expression, then lineage-specific differences in gene
expression of genes should be unaffected by whether a neighbouring intergenic lncRNA locus is transcribed.
The existence of relatively large numbers of lineage-specific
intergenic lncRNAs in mouse and rat permitted this hypothesis to
be tested using Mmus and Rnor. Two additional reasons that we
specifically analysed the intergenic lncRNAs identified in these two
species were (i) the high quality of the genome annotations, relative
to Mcas, and (ii) the existence of other published datasets that
permitted further validation of our results .
First, we normalised gene expression for Mmus and Rnor
RNAseq data (see Materials and Methods, Figure S9A) and
validated the fold-difference on 17 selected protein-coding mRNA
by RT-qPCR (Figure S9C and S9D). In order to obtain a baseline
for transcriptional variation between species from this normalised
set, we first estimated the fold difference in liver expression
between 230 Mmus housekeeping protein-coding genes 
one-to-one
orthologous

fold-difference in expression = 0.020, see Materials and Methods).
Next, we identified the closest protein-coding gene for each
conserved or lineage-specific Mmus or Rnor intergenic lncRNA.
We selected the intergenic lncRNA loci whose neighbouring
protein-coding genes had annotated one-to-one orthologs in
the second species (Table S9).
We found that the expression levels of the genes whose nearest
intergenic lncRNA locus showed conserved expression between
rodents (n = 148) were similar to housekeeping gene levels (median
fold-difference = 20.035, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p.0.36)
(Figure 4, Table S12).
We then asked whether gene expression levels alter when a
nearby intergenic lncRNA is gained or lost in one species. In
contrast to the conserved situation above, we found that those
protein-coding genes A nearest to lineage-specific intergenic
lncRNA loci (n = 137) tended to be expressed at a higher level,
with a median increase in gene expression of approximately 25%
(median fold-difference = 0.212, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test,
p,0.005) (Figure 4, Table S12). We repeated this analysis and
confirmed this result using an independent dataset . We found
that the median expression levels of protein-coding gene loci
adjacent to lineage-specific intergenic lncRNA loci were significantly higher than those of protein-coding gene loci near
conserved intergenic lncRNA loci (two-tailed Mann-Whitney test,
p,761025) (Figure S9B, Figure S10). Transcription increased for
half (50%) of those protein-coding genes lying adjacent to lineagespecific intergenic lncRNA loci, when assessed using either total
RNA or mRNA expression; in contrast, less than a third (29%) of
protein-coding genes near conserved intergenic lncRNA loci show
consistent increased expression in both datasets (two tailed Fisher’s
exact test, p,0.05, Figure S11), suggesting that in some cases gain
or loss of intergenic lncRNAs may influence the expression levels
of neighbouring genes. We next investigated if some relative
orientations of lineage-specific lncRNA transcription were more
frequently associated with increased expression of the most
proximal protein-coding gene. We divided lineage-specific intergenic lncRNA and protein-coding gene pairs into three classes
(Figure S12A): tandem (48 gene pairs) if transcription occurred in
the same orientation, divergent (71 gene pairs), or convergent (17
gene pairs) if transcription occurred in opposite directions either
diverging or converging, respectively. All three relative genomic
arrangements are associated with increased expression of the
closest protein-coding
genes. Both
and convergent
orientations are associated with significantly increased expression
at the 5% level while divergent orientation is significant at the 10%
level (p,0.08, Figure S12B).
We considered a number of possible interpretations for this
apparent association of lineage-specific intergenic lncRNAs with
Figure 3. Rodent conserved intergenic lncRNA loci and promoter sequences exhibit constraint. Normalised nucleotide substitution rates
for (A) 160 intergenic lncRNA loci conserved in rodents (expressed in Mmus, Mcas and Rnor) and 108 Mus genus specific intergenic lncRNA loci; and

proximal intergenic lncRNA promoters were defined as the 400 bp upstream region of the predicted TSS. Yellow dashed line represents the expected
neutral substitution rate. Compared to neutral sequence (ancestral repeats, AR) in the vicinity, nucleotide substitution rates differ significantly for loci
and promoter of intergenic lncRNA transcripts conserved in rodents (as indicated by asterisks ***, p,0.001) and the promoters of Mus genus specific
intergenic lncRNAs (***, p,0.001).

increased transcription of nearby protein-coding genes. The
increased gene expression could be either (i) due to regional
modifications to the genome that co-ordinately influence all coding
and noncoding loci or (ii) correlated with the transcription of
the proximal intergenic lncRNA locus . A key distinguishing feature between these two mechanisms is whether lineagespecific expression of intergenic lncRNAs is associated with
regional increases in transcription.
To test this, we identified the next most proximal protein-coding
gene B, beyond its closest protein-coding gene A (Figure 4A).
Genes duplicated in tandem often share regulatory elements and,
as a consequence, exhibit similar expression patterns . To
account for this evolutionary bias, we excluded 17 protein-coding
genes B that were annotated as protein-coding gene A
paralogs (see Materials and Methods). In contrast to the observed
lineage-specific effects on protein-coding genes A, the expression
levels of protein-coding genes B were not significantly affected
(two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p.0.7) by either conserved
(median fold-difference = 0.078) or lineage-specific (median folddifference = 20.088) intergenic lncRNA transcription (Figure 4,
Table S13).
We next tested whether similar results might be obtained for
lineage-specific protein-coding genes. We used the previously
identified set of Mus-genus lineage-specific expressed proteincoding genes. We identified genes A9 as the closest protein-coding
genes to these loci, protein-coding A9 (Figure S13). We excluded
paralogous protein-coding gene pairs and considered only proteincoding genes A9 with a one-to-one ortholog in rat (89 genes).

genes. (A) Effect of intergenic lncRNA (red) transcription on their closest protein-coding genes A (black) and their respective closest protein-coding

protein-coding gene A is significantly (represented by asterisks [**], p,0.005) higher than the expected variation in expression based on 230
housekeeping genes (white). Yellow dashed line represents median fold-difference in expression between Mmus and Rnor housekeeping genes.

Transcription levels of nearby genes appear unaffected by the
presence of lineage-specific protein-coding gene transcription in
the genomic vicinity (median fold-difference = 0.052, two-tailed
Mann-Whitney test, p.0.4) (Figure S13). As an additional control,
we compared the densities of chromatin boundary elements
(CCCTC-binding factor [CTCF]-bound sites) and DNase I
hypersensitivity sites in the intergenic regions between (i) the
lineage-specifically expressed intergenic lncRNA locus and its
neighboring protein-coding gene A and (ii) protein-coding genes B,
using data from previous studies . We found no significant
differences between these densities (permutation test p.0.2). The
association between lineage-specific lncRNA transcription and
increased expression levels of neighbouring protein-coding genes
might depend on the distance between their transcriptional start
sites (TSSs). The median distance of the TSS of a lineagespecifically expressed intergenic lncRNA with its closest proteincoding gene is 22 kb. However, no significant correlation was
observed between this distance and the median fold difference
in expression for protein-coding genes measured between mouse
and rat (Pearson correlation, R = 20.03, p = 0.76, Figure S14).
Our comparison of matched tissues in two species thus revealed
that birth or death of intergenic lncRNAs is associated with
changes in transcription of proximal protein-coding genes.
Discussion
To investigate the evolution of lncRNAs, we identified the
highest confidence set of lncRNAs in matched, nutritionally
unstressed, adult livers of three closely related rodent species:
Mmus, Mcas and Rnor, by combining genome-wide interrogation
of chromatin signatures and total RNA expression. This highly
conservative set of lncRNAs confirmed a number of prior
observations. First, many intergenic and antisense lncRNA loci
are expressed in a cell/tissue- or time-specific manner: we found
that the intergenic lncRNAs present in adult liver are not only
absent from other adult tissues, but are perhaps surprisingly even
absent in developing mouse liver. These temporally- and spatiallyrestricted expression patterns, together with their relatively low
expression levels, likely explain why our intergenic lncRNA set
shows limited overlap with previously reported sets . From our
analysis, two major results emerged: first, that intergenic and
antisense lncRNA transcription can evolve extremely rapidly
between closely related mammals; second, that this rapid evolution
seems to occur simultaneously with increased expression of
neighbouring protein-coding genes.
Evolution of intergenic and antisense lncRNA
transcription between closely related mammals
Previous studies have indicated that 12 to 15% of lncRNAs are
conserved between human and mouse, based on comparison of
EST and cDNA datasets from disparate experimental designs
 . Our matched interspecies data are perhaps better suited
to establish experimentally the rate of lncRNA turnover. The use
of mouse and rat, being closely related species, minimises the
effects of genomic sequence divergence, thus better uncoupling
sequence and transcriptional changes. Transcription of noncoding
loci is more frequently gained or lost than transcription of proteincoding genes; between 28% and 61% of intergenic and antisense
lncRNAs, respectively are specific to the Mus genus. We expect
similar turnover will be found in most cell types of various
developmental stages given that liver is a typical somatic tissue
 . The transience of intergenic lncRNA transcription is
mirrored by changes to selective pressures acting on their
sequences. Our results are consistent with purifying selection
acting on transcribed intergenic lncRNA loci, and with no
selection acting on untranscribed orthologous sequence in other
species. This coupling of transcriptional conservation with sequence constraint suggests that conserved intergenic lncRNA loci
are biologically significant in rodents.
Lineage-specific intergenic lncRNAs and transcription of
neighbouring protein-coding genes
expression
intergenic
genomically neighbouring protein-coding genes have previously
been shown to be positively correlated . We find that
species-specific transcription of intergenic lncRNAs correlates with
elevated expression of neighbouring protein-coding genes. The
increased transcription observed among neighbouring genes is
unique to intergenic lncRNAs, and seems unlikely to be due to
local changes in chromatin environment. If the intergenic
lncRNAs in other tissues and species behave similarly, intergenic
lncRNAs could contribute substantially to lineage-specific and
tissue-specific evolution of gene expression.
The rapid turnover we observed in lncRNA transcription
strongly resembles what was recently reported for transcription
factor binding events , tRNA transcription and
functional regulatory sequences in general . For instance,
between 10 to 20% of transcription factor binding events overlap
between human and mouse liver , which is similar in scale to
what we now find for intergenic lncRNAs. These parallels suggest
that rapid evolution is a general feature of noncoding regulatory
mechanisms.
It was recently proposed that intergenic lncRNAs have minimal
impact on the transcriptional regulation of their neighbouring
protein-coding genes . By exploiting the rapid birth and
death of noncoding RNAs, we revealed that intergenic lncRNAs
could contribute to lineage-specific changes in the expression levels
of neighbouring protein-coding genes. Our data do not preclude
distal regulatory roles, which might be lineage-specific, for some or
all intergenic lncRNAs we investigate. It will now be crucial to
understand how intergenic lncRNAs evolve and to unravel the
molecular mechanisms underlying lineage-specific gene expression
changes associated with intergenic lncRNAs.
Materials and Methods
Tissue preparation
ChIPseq, RNAseq, and RT-PCR experiments were performed
on liver material isolated from three rodents: Mus musculus
domesticus (Mmus), Mus musculus castaneus (Mcas), and Rattus
norvegicus (Rnor). Each ChIPseq and RNAseq experiments were
performed on at least two independent biological replicates from
different animals. Mmus and Mcas (male adults, 10 weeks old)
were obtained from the Cambridge Research Institute. Rnor (male
adults, 9 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River. All tissues
were either treated post-mortem with 1% formaldehyde for ChIP
experiments or flash-frozen in liquid N2 for RNA experiments.
The investigation was approved by the ethics committee and
followed the Cambridge Research Institute guidelines for the use
of animals in experimental studies under Home Office license PPL
Library and sequencing preparation
ChIP sequencing experiments were performed as described
previously using H3K4me3 antibody (CMA304) . In
brief, the immunoprecipitated DNA was end-repaired, A-tailed,
ligated to the sequencing adapters, amplified by 18 cycles of PCR
and size selected (200–300 bp). For RNA-sequencing library

preparation, total RNA was extracted using Qiazol reagents
(Qiagen) and DNase-treated (Turbo DNase, Ambion). Ribosomal
RNA was depleted from total RNA using RiboMinus (Invitrogen).
RNA was reversed transcribed and converted into doublestranded cDNA (SuperScript cDNA synthesis kit, Invitrogen),
sheared by sonication followed by paired end adapter (Illumina)
ligation and prior to PCR amplification cDNA was UNG-treated
to maintain strand-specificity . After passing quality control on
a Bioanalyzer 1000 DNA chip (Agilent) libraries were sequenced
on the Illumina Genome Analyzer II (single-ended) and postprocessed using the standard GA pipeline software v1.4 (Illumina).
Read mapping and next-generation sequencing (NGS)
data analysis
H3K4me3 ChIPseq and associated input DNA control ChIPseq
reads were aligned to the corresponding reference genomes (mm9
for Mus musculus domesticus and Mus musculus castaneus; Rn4 for Rattus
norvegicus) using MAQ version 0.7.1 (default parameters) .
Reads mapping to multiple genomic locations were discarded.
Genomic regions enriched over matching input DNA control were
defined using MACS version 1.3.7.1 using the default parameters
 . Comparative analysis was carried out using the Galaxy web
tool . Total RNA sequencing reads were mapped with Tophat
(version 1.3.0) , using default parameters. A file containing the
mapped coordinates of mouse and rat ESTs and mRNA mapped
coordinates 
was provided to facilitate total RNA read mapping across splice
junction for Mmus and Mcas, and Rnor respectively. Reads
mapping to rRNA, tRNA and mtRNA were masked and the
remainder were used to assemble transcripts de novo using Cufflinks
(version 1.3.0) .
Transcript and promoter annotation
We filtered out transcripts smaller than 200 nucleotides (nt) and
without an H3K4me3 peak overlapping their predicted transcriptional start site (TSS). Transcripts overlapping protein-coding gene
annotations (by one or more base pair) from RefSeq, Ensembl
(build 60) and UCSC were annotated as intragenic. To
discriminate between unannotated protein-coding and putatively
noncoding transcripts we estimated the coding potential of all
intergenic transcripts using the coding potential calculator (CPC)
 . We annotated all transcripts with a coding potential less than
0 as intergenic long noncoding RNAs (intergenic lncRNAs). The
400 nt region upstream of the 59 end (TSS) of each intergenic
lncRNA or protein-coding transcript was annotated as a putative
promoter. Transcribed loci were defined as non-overlapping
regions with one or more transcripts that can contain overlapping
exonic or intronic nucleotides. Loci containing only transcripts
predicted to be intergenic lncRNAs were annotated as intergenic
lncRNA loci. The remainder were annotated as protein-coding
For the identification of antisense transcripts from the Cufflinks
output file (n = 56917), we first identified 2383 transcripts
overlapping protein-coding genes in antisense orientation in
Mmus. This number included four types of ambiguous cases that
were systematically removed: (i) annotated protein-coding transcripts (removing 1816 transcripts), (ii) antisense transcripts lacking
an H3K4me3 peak independent from the TSS of overlapping
protein-coding gene (removing 324 transcripts), (iii) transcripts
lacking H3K4me3 marks at their 59 end, and (iv) mapping
assembly artefacts, revealed by visual inspection (collectively
removing 90 transcripts). Taking all of these cases into consideration, 49 loci (or 153 antisense transcripts) were annotated in
Mmus. A similar procedure was conducted in Mcas and Rnor,
revealing 66 loci in total.
To identify lncRNAs deriving from bidirectional transcription
at TSSs of protein-coding genes, we subtracted divergently
transcribed
protein-coding
transcribed protein-coding genes. The TSSs of gene loci are
spanned by one H3K4me3 peak and the evidence of divergent
transcription is represented by RNAseq reads mapping in opposite
directions. We identified divergent reads within an 1 kb window of
a protein-coding gene’s annotated TSS (Ensembl, build 60) .
Heatmaps and transcription start site aggregation plots were
constructed using seqMINER .
To account for the difference in RNAseq library size between
the three rodent species (Table S1) Mmus and Rnor transcripts
were assembled using the same number of reads in Mcas library,
the smallest RNAseq library. Reads were randomly selected
without replacement and transcripts reassembles using Cufflinks
and annotated as described above.
Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
RT-PCR analysis of lncRNAs was performed by reverse
transcription of 10 mg of DNase-treated total RNA according to
the manufacturer’s protocols using 200 U SuperScript-II Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen Corporation), 0.5 mg oligo(dT) and
0.5 mg random primers or 1 mg gene-specific primers (see Table
S11). Negative controls were included in RT reactions. The
cDNAs were then treated with RNase H at 37uC for 1 hour. Each
PCR reaction typically contained 25 ng of cDNA, 5 pmol of the
gene-specific primers (Table S11), 10 mL PCR Master Mix
(Bioline), and 2 mL of the diluted cDNAs in a total volume of
20 mL. Reactions were carried out in triplicate in ABI 7900HT
Fast Real-Time PCR system at the optimal temperature, as
defined by provider instructions.
Genome-wide associations
The significance of genome-wide associations between intergenic lncRNAs and their neighbouring protein-coding genes was
assessed using Genome Association Tool (GAT) (Heger et al., in
preparation). GAT compares the observed number of overlapping
nucleotides between a set of segments with particular annotations
to what would be expected from random placement of these
segments. Expected densities are obtained using a randomisation
procedure that accounts for G+C content and chromosome
specific biases. A previous version of GAT was used in . This
tool infers associations between intergenic lncRNA loci (segments)
across the following annotation sets: (I) mouse-to-rat indel purified
liver-expressed
protein-coding
territories (Average Difference values .200) . A proteincoding gene territory is defined as the genomic region containing
all nucleotides that are closer to the gene than they are to its most
proximal up- and downstream protein-coding genes, as described
elsewhere . As a second tool, we used the gene functional
classification tool Database for Annotation, Visualization, and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (default parameters: count = 2 and
ease = 0.1) to explore the enrichment of tissue
expression.
Regions of the mouse and rat genome that are enriched in
CTFC binding were obtained from . DNase hypersensity sites
(DHS) in the mouse adult liver were obtained from . Only
male and sex independent DHS peaks that were either annotated
as being robust and standard were considered in this analysis.
GAT (Heger et al., in preparation) was used to test the observed
density of these two class of regulatory elements in the intergenic
region between lineage-specific intergenic lncRNAs and protein

coding gene A (Figure 4) to what would be expected based on their
distribution across the intergenic regions between lineage-specific
intergenic lncRNA and protein-coding gene B (Figure 4).
Transcriptional conservation
Orthologous regions between Mmus and Rnor were identified
using whole genome pairwise alignments . An intergenic
lncRNA locus was considered to be expressed in another species
when its orthologous (between Mus species and Rnor) or
equivalent (between Mmus and Mcas) position had an overlapping
(.1 bp) H3K4me3 peak and one or more overlapping RNAseq
reads. Due to the lack of H3K4me3 data for human, overlap
(.1 bp) by one or more RNAseq reads in the orthologous human
location was considered sufficient evidence for transcriptional
conservation of an Mmus locus in human sequence. Only Mmus
loci whose transcription was supported by one or more polyA+
selected sequencing read were considered in this analysis.
Identical criteria were used to determine the conservation of
antisense lncRNA loci. An antisense lncRNA locus was judged to
be expressed in another species when its orthologous position had
an overlapping (.1 bp) H3K4me3 peak and one or more
overlapping RNAseq reads in opposite orientations. We visually
inspected these calls on 66 loci across the three rodent species.
Nucleotide constraint
Nucleotide constraint between Mmus and Rnor locus, exon,
intron or putative promoter was estimated as described previously
 . Pairwise substitution rates between Mmus and Rnor genomic
regions were estimated using BASEML from the PAML package
with the REV substitution model . The substitution rate of the
region of interest was compared to the rate observed for nonoverlapping adjacent (,500 kb) ancestral repeats (inserted before
the primate and rodent split) with similar G+C content .
Gene expression
Mmus and Rnor protein-coding transcript annotations were
downloaded from Ensembl (build 60, 
index.html) and used to define a set of constitutive exons for each
gene. To account for differences in size of constitutively expressed
portions of Mmus and Rnor genes, the total number of
overlapping reads per nucleotide in Rnor was adjusted to what
would be expected if the sequence in Rnor had the same length as
that observed in Mmus. The expression of a gene in Rnor or
Mmus is proportional to the sum of reads mapped to their exons
divided by their combined length. To allow comparison of gene
expression between species, read counts were normalized using
TMM (edgeR package) . Briefly, to estimate the normalised
library size for each species, it was assumed that 60% of expressed
genes were transcribed at similar levels in the two species. Other
cut-offs (50% and 70%) yielded similar results. The normalised
Mmus and Rnor library size was used to calculate the expression
level (as total number of fragments per kb of sequence per million
reads mapped, FPKM) of each gene in each species.
Gene expression differences between mouse and rat
Each intergenic lncRNA locus was paired with its genomically
closest protein-coding gene. Only pairs whose protein-coding
genes had one-to-one orthologs between Mmus and Rnor were
considered. The fold difference in expression levels of proteincoding genes associated with lineage-specific (Mus-genus or Rnorspecific) or rodent conserved expression was estimated between 
the same direction. To calculate the fold difference in expression
for each housekeeping gene between Mmus and Rnor species X
and Y were randomly assigned. Fold expression differences
for protein-coding genes B or A9 (Figure 4, Figure S12) were
calculated in a similar manner.

performed using the R package .

dAR = 0.843) than those of protein-coding genes (median dpromoter/
dAR = 0.746) (two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p,261025). The
substitution rate for each loci were normalised to the substitution
rate measured for AR with matched G+C content in their vicinity

lncRNA loci and protein-coding genes. The cumulative distributions of substitution rates between mouse and rat is shown for (A)
160 intergenic lncRNA loci and 6641 protein-coding gene loci
whose expression is conserved between mouse and rat. Median

distribution of substitution rates for the exonic sequence of 160
intergenic lncRNA loci and 6641 protein-coding loci whose
expression is rodent conserved. Intergenic lncRNA exons evolved
under significantly (Mann-Whitney test, p,10215) less constraint
(median dexon/dAR = 0.805) than those of protein-coding genes
(median dexon/dAR = 0.484). (C) Cumulative distribution of substitution rates for the intronic sequence of 26 intergenic lncRNA loci
and 4571 protein-coding genes. Intergenic lncRNA introns
(median dintron/dAR = 0.959) accumulated substitutions at similar
rates to introns in protein-coding genes (median dintron/dAR = 0.986)
(two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p.0.28). The substitution rate for
each loci were normalised to the substitution rate measured for
ancestral repeats (AR) with similar G+C content in their vicinity
(,500 kb). Cumulative proportion plots for intergenic lncRNAs
and protein-coding genes are represented in red and in black,
respectively. Number of loci studied are shown in parentheses.

Normalised expression values of Mmus and Rnor
one-to-one orthologous protein-coding genes correlate. Normalised expression level estimates [log(FPKM)] based on (A) total
RNA and (B) mRNA sequencing reads of mouse (x-axis) and rat
(y-axis) are positively correlated. Pearson correlation (R) are
reported at bottom right of each panel. Median fold differences
(log scale) of selected protein-coding gene products obtained from
(C) RNAseq experiments were validated by (D) RT-qPCR of three
independent biological replicates. The order of transcripts selected
in (C) was maintained in (D). Yellow: mRNAs upregulated in
mouse (or downregulated in rat), grey: transcripts with similar
expression fold changes in mouse and rat, and blue: mRNAs
downregulated in mouse (or upregulated in rat).

Figure S11
Lineage specific intergenic lncRNA transcription
associates with consistent increased expression levels of neighbouring protein-coding genes. Expression levels for most proteincoding genes near lineage-specific intergenic lncRNAs (Mus
genus- or Rnor-specific, left) are increased in comparison to
protein-coding genes near rodent conserved intergenic lncRNAs
(right). White: decrease, grey: ambiguous (inconsistent direction of
change between two experiments), black: increase.
Figure S12
Lineage-specific intergenic lncRNAs are associated
with increased expression of genomically adjacent protein-coding
genes independent of relative orientations. (A) Relative orientations of lineage-specific intergenic lncRNAs (red) and their closest
protein-coding neighbouring genes (black) are illustrated. Intergenic lncRNAs are placed downstream of its protein-coding loci in
this diagram for illustrative purposes. Intergenic lncRNA and
protein-coding gene pairs were divided into three classes: (i)
tandem if transcription occurs in the same directions (48 pairs); (ii)
convergent (17 pairs); and (iii) divergent (71 pairs). (B) Folddifference in expression for one-to-one orthologous protein-coding
gene pairs adjacent to lineage-specific (Mus genus- or Rnorspecific) intergenic lncRNA loci. The fold-difference in expression
for Mmus and Rnor protein-coding genes was higher (two-tailed
Mann-Whitney test; tandem: p-value,0.05; convergent: p,0.05;
divergent: p,0.1) than the expected variation in expression based
on 230 housekeeping genes (white). Yellow dashed line represents
median fold-difference in expression between Mmus and Rnor
housekeeping genes. In parentheses are the numbers of proteincoding genes studied.
Figure S13
Rodent conserved and lineage-specific proteincoding genes are not associated with elevated expression of their
closest neighbouring protein-coding gene. Effect of protein-coding
gene (grey) transcription on their closest protein-coding genes A9
(black) was determined for (A) rodent conserved and (B) lineagespecific protein-coding gene pairs. (C) The median fold-difference
in expression level between mouse and rat for protein-coding
genes A9 closest to protein-coding genes with conserved expression
in rodents (median fold-difference = 0.04) is not significantly
different from the median fold-difference in expression for 230
housekeeping
genes (two-tailed

Lineage-specifically expressed protein-coding genes (Mus genus)
are also not associated with significant (two-tailed Mann-Whitney
test, p.0.4) differences in expression of their closest protein-coding
gene (median fold-difference = 0.05). The yellow dashed line
represents median fold-difference in expression between Mmus
and Rnor housekeeping genes. Numbers of protein-coding genes
studied are shown in parentheses.
Figure S14
Distance of protein-coding genes to nearest lineage–
specific intergenic lncRNA loci and expression levels of proteincoding genes do not correlate. The lineage-specific effect of
intergenic lncRNA expression on its neighbouring protein-coding
genes does not correlate with the distance between the two loci.
The smallest distance (base pairs) between the TSSs for each
intergenic lncRNA and protein-coding gene A pair (y-axis, logscale) is plotted against the corresponding fold-difference in
expression between Mmus and Rnor (x-axis, log-scale). These
measures are not significantly (p = 0.76) correlated (Pearson
correlation coefficient R = 20.026).
