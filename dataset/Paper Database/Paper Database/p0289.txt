DrugBank ( is a comprehensive online database containing extensive biochemical and pharmacological information about
drugs, their mechanisms and their targets. Since it
was first described in 2006, DrugBank has rapidly
evolved, both in response to user requests and in
response to changing trends in drug research and
development. Previous versions of DrugBank have
been widely used to facilitate drug and in silico drug
target discovery. The latest update, DrugBank 4.0,
has been further expanded to contain data on drug
metabolism, absorption, distribution, metabolism,
excretion and toxicity (ADMET) and other kinds of
quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR)
information. These enhancements are intended to
facilitate research in xenobiotic metabolism (both
prediction and characterization), pharmacokinetics,
pharmacodynamics and drug design/discovery. For
this release, >1200 drug metabolites (including their
structures, names, activity, abundance and other
detailed data) have been added along with >1300
drug metabolism reactions (including metabolizing
enzymes and reaction types) and dozens of drug
metabolism pathways. Another 30 predicted or
measured ADMET parameters have been added
to each DrugCard, bringing the average number
quantitative
Drug Administration-approved drugs close to 40.
Referential nuclear magnetic resonance and MS
spectra have been added for almost 400 drugs as
facilitate compound identification. This expanded
collection of drug information is complemented by
a number of new or improved search tools, including
one that provides a simple analyses of drug–target,
–enzyme and –transporter associations to provide
insight on drug–drug interactions.

well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacoeconomic information (10). For 2014, DrugBank has been enhanced to
capture the increasing body of quantitative knowledge
about drugs and improved technologies to detect drugs,
their metabolites and their downstream effects. In particular, signiﬁcant improvements and large-scale additions in
the areas of QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationships), ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity), pharmacometabolomics and
pharmacogenomics have been made. Existing information
about drug structures, drug salt-forms, drug names, drug
targets and drug actions has also been expanded and
updated. Numerous approved and experimental drugs
have been added along with a number of new data ﬁelds
describing each drug. New search tools have also been
developed or improved on to increase the ease with
which information can be found.
Many of the enhancements made over the past 3 years
were stimulated by user feedback and suggestions. We are
grateful to our users and continue to strive to meet their
needs. Further details on the additions and enhancements
made to DrugBank 4.0 are described later.
DATABASE ADDITIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS
The development and evolution of DrugBank, including
previous data content additions, curation protocols,
features and data sources, has been described previously
(8–10). Here we shall focus on enhancements and changes
made since the release of DrugBank 3.0. In particular, we
will discuss (i) enhancements made to existing data, (ii) the
addition of new data ﬁelds, (iii) new and enhanced search
features and (iv) a new user feedback/commenting system.
Enhancement of existing data
DrugBank has evolved signiﬁcantly since its inception in
2006 with a progressive expansion in the depth and
breadth of its data as well as improvements to the
quality and reliability of its information. The enhancements and additions in data content between DrugBank
1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 are summarized in Table 1. As seen in
this table, DrugBank 4.0 has seen a further 40% increase
in the number of data ﬁelds per DrugCard. The number of
FDA-approved drugs has increased by 19%, biotech
drugs by 14% and >1200 new investigational drugs (in
phase I, II or III trials) have been added. Likewise, the
number of drugs with transporters and carrier proteins
has increased by 40 and 30%, respectively. Additionally,
the number of QSAR parameters has grown by 64% and
the number of ADMET parameters by 650%. The
number of drug–drug interactions and the number of
drug–food interactions have grown by 2.5% and 14%,
respectively. Similarly, the number of drug target singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has grown by 10%,
whereas the number of SNPs associated with adverse
drug effects (SNP-FX and SNP-ADR) has grown by
78%. In addition, the number of illustrated drug action
pathways has grown by 38%. Furthermore, chemical synthesis information has been added to >1200 drugs, with
many synthesis references now hyperlinked to patents and
reaction schemes maintained by Drugsyn.org (http://
www.drugsyn.org).
Data quality and currency have always been two of the
priorities
Consequently, signiﬁcant efforts over the past 3 years
have been directed at improving the quality of existing
DrugCards and keeping them as up-to-date as possible.
Unlike DrugBank (i.e. the database), which has a 2–3-year
release cycle, DrugBank’s DrugCards are continuously
updated as new information becomes available. Because
new drugs are constantly being approved, and old drugs
are perpetually being re-characterized, re-purposed or
removed, our curation team is continuously combing the
literature to update existing DrugCards or to add new
DrugCards. As a result, hundreds of drug descriptions,
drug targets, indications, pharmacodynamics data, mechanisms of action and metabolism data ﬁelds have been
added, re-written and/or expanded over the past 3 years.
We have also updated and re-written all of DrugBank’s
drug–drug interactions. In particular, we have included or
updated all interactions where modiﬁcations in drug
therapy are recommended either by the manufacturer or
other data sources.
nomenclature
particularly
pharmacists, physicians and the drug industry. Many
drugs have dozens or even hundreds of alternate names,
brand names or synonyms, often arising because of
various trademark, patenting and/or marketing requirements. For the latest release of DrugBank, all of its
synonyms and brand names were extensively reviewed.
Lengthy chemical and salt-form names were removed
included, enabling users to more easily browse alternate
drug names. Brand names or synonyms appearing on
more than one DrugCard were also identiﬁed and edited
or removed as required. In total, >8000 duplicated or partially duplicated brand names and synonyms were edited
or removed as part of DrugBank 4.0’s nomenclature
remediation effort.
DrugBank’s experimental drug data set was also
reviewed, remediated and expanded. In particular, experimental drugs binding to non–human targets were removed
with the exception of those that bind to known bacterial,
viral and fungal pathogens. Experimental drug targets originally referenced to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (5) are
now referenced to the original publications. Additional
experimental drugs were added from a variety of literature
sources and online databases, such as ChEMBL (11).
Further data quality checks on drug structures were
carried out by identifying InChI keys and ChEBI IDs
appearing on more than one DrugCard. In some cases,
duplicate IDs were the result of duplicate DrugCards,
whereas in other cases, the IDs referred to stereoisomers
that did not have stereochemistry depicted in their structures. These structures were manually corrected. In total,
600 corrections of various forms were performed as part
of the DrugBank 4.0 structure remediation effort.
Drug classes are a useful way of grouping drugs with
similar therapeutic effects and mechanisms of action. In
the latest version of DrugBank, we expanded on the

information provided by the Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical (ATC) Classiﬁcation System deﬁned by the
Collaborating
Statistics
Methodology (12). The ﬁrst four levels of the classiﬁcation
system (anatomical main group, therapeutic subgroup,
pharmacological subgroup and chemical subgroup) are
CategoryCards. The CategoryCard for each anatomical
main group shows a listing of therapeutic subgroups,
which can be expanded to show pharmacological subgroups, which can be further expanded to show chemical
subgroups, which are expandable to ﬁnally show the ﬁfth
level, chemical substances or drug names. This new tree
structure and the new browsing function called Category
Browse effectively replaces the old PharmaBrowse found
in earlier versions of DrugBank. Adopting this well-established classiﬁcation system in DrugBank 4.0 enables users to
more easily search for drugs with similar pharmacologic
New data ﬁelds
As noted earlier, signiﬁcant efforts for this year’s release of
DrugBank have been directed toward adding new data on
metabolism,
pharmacometabolomics,
pharmacogenomics and a variety of QSAR. New data
ﬁelds are also highlighted in Table 1. These additions to
DrugBank 4.0 were motivated by the fast-moving developments
xenobiotic
metabolism,
pharmacometabolomics, pharmacogenomics, pre-clinical
drug screening and computer-aided drug design.
With regard to DrugBank 4.0’s effort to capture more
drug metabolism information, it is important to note that
the database now contains >1200 drug metabolites
(including their structures, names, activity, abundance
and other detailed data) along with drug metabolism
reaction data for >1000 approved drugs. These drug metabolism data include the sequence of reactions, reaction
types and whether drug metabolites are active, inactive
and/or major circulating entities. In addition, DrugBank
now offers comprehensive, colorful, manually drawn

spectrometry). By providing the drug research community
with >1200 drug metabolites (along with their corresponding phase I and II enzymes), we are also hoping
that new and improved software could be developed for
predicting the structure of drug metabolites. Efforts are
already underway in our laboratory to develop open
access freeware for drug metabolism prediction.
In addition to the substantial additions to DrugBank’s
drug metabolism data, the quantity and diversity of
ADMET data in DrugBank 4.0 has also been signiﬁcantly
increased. Although a modest amount of ADMET data
was included in previous versions of DrugBank (8–10), it
was generally limited to a small number of approved
drugs. However, by taking advantage of several recently
predicting
properties (14) and mining newly published ADMET
surveys (15,16), it has been possible to add 30 more
ADMET data ﬁelds to nearly all of DrugBank’s drug
ADMET values for Caco cell permeability (as a proxy
for intestinal permeability), blood–brain barrier permeability, human intestinal absorption levels, P-glycoprotein
activity, Cyp450 substrate preferences, renal transport
activity, carcinogenicity, toxicity, Ames test activity and
human Ether a-go-go Related Gene (hERG) activity,
along with their probability scores.
of metabolomics
pharmacometabolomics continue to evolve, we believe there is an
increasing need to develop drug databases that are compatible with the needs of metabolomic researchers. In particular, referential mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of pure drugs and
their metabolites are particularly important for identifying
and/or quantifying compounds in biological matrices.
Prescription and over-the-counter medications are frequently found in human bioﬂuid samples characterized
in metabolomic studies. To meet these compound identi-
ﬁcation/characterization needs, >750 NMR and 3763 MS
reference spectra for 400 different drugs have been
added to DrugBank 4.0. Many of these spectra were experimentally acquired by our laboratory (17), whereas
others have been assembled from freely available online
sources (18,19). In addition to including these reference
MS and NMR spectra, we have also added a number of
advanced spectral viewing and spectral/mass matching
tools [originally developed for the HMDB (17)] to facilitate metabolomic studies. Using these tools, users can
submit chemical shift or m/z (mass to charge ratio) lists
and search against DrugBank’s spectral library for exact
or even approximate matches. Users can also browse,
zoom and view all of DrugBank’s spectral data to
visually compare results and assess spectral matches. To
DrugBank’s

metabolomic activities, we have also added an extensive
chemical taxonomy or chemical classiﬁcation system that
uses the same hierarchical design and nomenclature as
developed for other metabolomic databases (17,20). In
particular, compounds are classiﬁed into ‘Kingdoms’,
‘Superclasses’, ‘Classes’, ‘Subclasses’, ‘Direct Parents’,
‘Molecular

etc) but also more data on chemical substituents (see
chemical taxonomy, earlier) and extensive quantitative information on drug–ligand binding constants. The binding
constant data have been mined from several sources
including the primary literature and BindingDB (21).
The combination of DrugBank’s existing 2D and 3D
structural data along with new molecular descriptor,
molecular substituent and binding constant data for thousands of drugs should allow researchers to perform much
more sophisticated and extensive QSAR studies.
Many drugs exist in a variety of salt forms, and these
salt variants can play a signiﬁcant role in the efﬁcacy,
delivery or indication for certain drugs. Historically,
DrugBank has only provided the structure of ‘base’

we have now added salt-form structures to DrugBank 4.0.
New and enhanced search features
The quality of a database is determined not only by the
quality of its content but also by the ease with which users
can access or navigate through its data. In this regard, the
DrugBank team has continuously strived to improve
the database’s user interface, to enhance its search utilities
and to respond to user suggestions. For DrugBank 4.0, we
have added two new browsing features to ease the retrieval
of information: (i) Reaction Browse and (ii) Category
Multi-Search
DrugBank’s

Lookup system) and streamlined the existing browsing
DrugBrowse,
GenoBrowse
Association Browse. A simple tool called BioInteractor
for rapidly retrieving and analyzing the biochemical data
in DrugBank has also been added. We have also upgraded
DrugBank’s text search engine to improve the speed and
quality of the search results, and we have further enhanced
DrugBank’s Data Extractor to make it easier to use and
far more accessible. These new and improved search/
browsing features should substantially increase the ease
with which users are able to navigate, retrieve and
extract information from DrugBank.
Reaction Browse was developed to facilitate the viewing
and searching of drug metabolism reactions. Its easily
searchable table format allows users to rapidly browse
through pages displaying each of the drug metabolism
reactions in DrugBank. Each drug, metabolite, enzyme
and reaction is hyperlinked to its respective DrugCard,
MetaboCard, EnzymeCard and ReactionCard. Search
bars above each column of the Reaction Browse table
enable users to search by drug name, DrugBank ID, metabolite name, DrugBank metabolite ID, enzyme name,

UniProt ID or any combination of the above (Figure 1).
Category Browse (which replaces the old PharmaBrowse)
is a simple search tool that enables users to browse and
search for drugs by category based on pharmacological
action or their ATC Classiﬁcation (12). All four levels of
the ATC classiﬁcation system are listed together to facilitate searching. Each ATC drug category is hyperlinked to
a CategoryCard as described earlier. Furthermore, each
drug listed in the CategoryCard can be expanded to
show drug targets enabling users to easily compare drug
targets from the same category (Figure 1).
A new addition to DrugBank’s large selection of
search and browsing toolbox is called BioInteractor.

instance, which drugs act similarly on the same target.
Such drugs may have additive pharmacodynamic effects
if given concomitantly. Conversely, two drugs may antagonize the beneﬁcial effects of each other by having
opposite actions on a speciﬁc drug target. Although clinically relevant drug–drug interactions are well documented in commercial databases such as those produced
by Lexi-Comp Inc., the mechanisms of interactions are

BioInteractor will yield all possible enzyme-mediated

insight on the probability of a clinically relevant interaction occurring.
In addition to these new search tools, we have also
improved DrugBank’s standard search tools. In particular, we have upgraded DrugBank’s text search engine to
Elasticsearch

advanced and scalable enterprise search backend. It is
also now possible to search across drug targets, drug–
drug and drug–food interactions, metabolic reactions, metabolites and other relevant search ﬁelds. In addition,
search results can now be downloaded using DrugBank’s
upgraded Data Extractor. The new Data Extractor
appears in all of DrugBank’s standard browse and
search windows, allowing users to easily extract, download and save their current data view at any point. In
addition, all DrugBank data extractions performed by
Data Extractor are saved for up to 1 month, so users
can return at any time to retrieve their results. We have
also upgraded DrugBank’s Advanced Search, thereby improving the granularity and coverage of data ﬁelds in
DrugBank. This should allow users to build much more
complex queries through Advanced Search’s simple interface.
DrugBank’s
combined with the Data Extractor, should allow users to
search, retrieve or extract almost any kind of data type or
combination of data within DrugBank.
User feedback, commenting system and news feed
Since the DrugBank was ﬁrst released in 2006, the web has
transformed into a dynamic social environment. News,
blogs and scientiﬁc online resources provide users with
the ability to leave comments and discuss articles. In
response to these changes, we have added a commenting
feature at the end of each DrugCard, enabling users to
submit comments that are moderated by the DrugBank
curation team. This commenting system was designed to
enable users to engage with the DrugBank curators, to
provide a detailed record of changes and to stimulate conversation among the scientiﬁc community. Hundreds of
excellent user comments have been received and acted
on since this feature was implemented. Additionally, we
have created a DrugBank Twitter account allowing
DrugBank curators to report news, maintenance issues
and provide updates, while at the same time allowing
users to supply feedback through social media. Engaging
our users has always been a priority, and supplying a
vehicle to provide feedback will result in higher data
quality and an improved user experience.
CONCLUSION
Over the past 7 years DrugBank has grown from a small,
somewhat specialized drug database, to a large, comprehensive drug knowledgebase covering almost all aspects of
drug function, formulation and structure. Throughout this
evolution, we have strived to maintain the highest quality
and currency of data, to continuously improve the quality
of its user interface and to attentively listen to all members
of its user community. With this latest release of
DrugBank, we have continued to make substantial improvements to both the quality/currency of its data and
the quality of its user interface. We have also added substantial quantities of new and, what we believe will be,
highly relevant data pertaining to drug metabolism, drug
metabolites, drug salt-forms, ADMET and QSAR. These
additions and enhancements are intended to facilitate
research in xenobiotic metabolism (both prediction and
characterization), pharmacometabolomics, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmaceutics and drug design/
discovery. They are also intended to make the data within
DrugBank relevant to a far wider audience, including researchers
metabolomics,
pharmacogenomics
pharmacology, formulation chemists, pharmacists, physicians, educators and the general public. Our commitment
to continue to maintain, update and improve DrugBank
will continue for the foreseeable future. Based on current
trends in pharmaceutical and pharmacological research, it
is likely that future versions of DrugBank will include
many more drug action and drug metabolism pathways,
much more information regarding the transport and
uptake of drugs as well as greater detail regarding the
mechanisms
underlying
drug-associated adverse reactions.
