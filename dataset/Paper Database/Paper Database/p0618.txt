A new quantum-stochastic diﬀerential calculus is derived for representing
continuous quantum measurement of the position operator. Closed nonlinear
quantum-stochastic diﬀerential equation is given for the quantum state of
the observed particle. Possible physical realization of continuous position
measurement is constructed.
1. Introduction
In 1982 Barchielli, Lanz and Prosperi suggested a theory of continuous
quantum measurement1 including observables of continuous spectra such like,
e.g., coordinate operator.
Various equivalent formalisms were elaborated:
path integrals1, characteristic functionals2, quantum-stochastic diﬀerential
equations (QSDE’s)3,4. Very recently, Ghirardi, Rimini and Weber have proposed the appealing uniﬁcation of microscopic and macroscopic dynamics5 in
the frame of a similar theory to that of continuous quantum measurements.
In this paper we suggest a simple quantum-stochastic formulation, `a la
Itˆo, for continuous quantum measurements1. It shows very close relationship
to the Stratonowitch-calculus used by Gisin for discrete observables6.
Sect. 2 we outline the principles of continuous observation and present the
proper nonlinear Itˆo-equations (which diﬀer from Itˆo-equations of Ref. 4).
The derivation of our equations is postponed to Sect. 3; in Sect. 4 we propose
a possible physical model to which our formalism can presumably be applied.
2. Continuous position measurement, Itˆo-equations
In order to reduce the amount of technical work we single out the simplest
example and we consider the continuous measurement of the position ˆq of a
free particle of mass m moving in one dimension.
Let the state vector ψ satisfy the free Schr¨odinger equation; then the
density operator ˆρ ≡ψψ† obeys the following equation:
−(i/2m)[ˆp2, ˆρ]
ˆp is the momentum operator canonically conjugated to the coordinate ˆq.
Now, Refs. 1, 5 introduce instantaneous stochastic changes, too:
ˆρ →[P(¯q)]−1T¯q[ˆρ] ≡
≡[P(¯q)]−1p
α/π exp[−1
2α(ˆq −¯q)2]ˆρ exp[−1
2α(ˆq −¯q)2]
called measurement (or localization) processes which repeatedly occur at
equidistant moments1 separated by ∆t. In the above equation α denotes
the accuracy parameter of measurement. The measured coordinate ¯q is selected at random with the probability distribution
P(¯q) = trT¯q[ˆρ] =
α/πtrˆρ exp[−α(ˆq −¯q)2] .
The Eqs. (2.1-3) prescribe a certain joint stochastic process for ˆρ ≡ψψ† and
¯q. Barchielli et al. deﬁne the continuous measurement of the position ˆq by
taking the following limit
∆t, α →0, α/∆t = γ = const.
of the stochastic process. [Here we have to note that Ghirardi et al.5 suggest
ﬁnite values for α and ∆t, without requiring the limes (2.4). Nevertheless,
they also notice that most physical characteristics of their theory depend
only on the ration γ = α/∆t.]
Observe that, while ˆρ is a function of the time t, the other stochastic
variable ¯q only makes sense for the instants of the measurement process
(2.2). Let us extend the deﬁnition of ¯q for all time: one can, e.g., identify ¯qt
by the proper continuous zig-zag function of time. We introduce then a new
variable ¯Q instead of ¯q:
In the next Section we shall prove that ˆρ and ¯Q follow a Gaussian process.
They obey the couple of stochastic diﬀerential equations; one is for the ˆρvalued quantum-stochastic process:
dˆρ = (−i[ˆp2/2m, ˆρ] −1
4γ[ˆq, [ˆq, ˆρ]])dt + {ˆq −¯q, ˆρ}dξ ,
the other is for the measured coordinate:
d ¯Q = ⟨ˆq⟩dt + γ−1dξ
Here ξ is a Wiener-process. The Itˆo-diﬀerential 7 dξ satisﬁes the following
⟨dξ⟩st = 0 ,
(dξ)n = 0 if n = 3, 4, . . .
Through our paper ⟨.⟩stands for the quantum expectation values while ⟨.⟩st
denotes stochastic means.
It is important to see that the QSDE (2.6) preserves the pure state property ˆρ ≡ψψ† = ˆρ2. In fact, it is enough to prove that dˆρ2 = dˆρ provided
ˆρ2 = ˆρ at a given moment. We therefore substitute the QSDE (2.6) into the
RHS of the identity dˆρ2 = {dˆρ, ˆρ} + dˆρdˆρ. Using the Itˆo-algebra (2.8) and
the assumption ˆρ2 = ˆρ, we arrive at the identity dˆρ2 = dˆρ.
One may notice that the so-called measured coordinate ¯q is not a good
representative of the particle trajectory. From the Eqs. (2.5) and (2.7) one
can formally get
¯q = ⟨ˆq⟩+ γ−1 ˙ξ
which means that ¯q is charged by a stationary white-noise making the graph
¯qt an awkward fractal8 instead of a trajectory. This problem has already
been emphasized in Refs. 1, 5 as well.
It is thus better to represent the trajectory by ⟨ˆq⟩instead of ¯q. Consequently, our proposal is to concentrate on the nonlinear quantum-stochastic
diﬀerential equation (QSDE) (2.6) [together with the Itˆo-algebra (2.8)]. This
QSDE, in itself, will account for all the physical behaviour of the particle affected by the continuous coordinate measurement.
3. Veriﬁcation of Itˆo-equations
In the present Section we are going to derive the stochastic diﬀerential equations (2.6),(2.7) starting from Eqs. (2.1-4) of continuous position
measurement1.
First we need the notion of stochastic mean for the measurement process
. P(¯q)d¯q
We introduce the change of our stochastic variables ˆρ and ¯Q taken for
one cycle of duration ∆t:
∆ˆρt ≡ˆρt+∆t −ˆρt =
−i[ˆp2/2m, ˆρt]∆t + [Pt(¯qt)]−1T¯qt[ˆρt] −ˆρt + O[(∆t)2]
¯Qt+∆t −¯Qt = ¯qt∆t + O[(∆t)2]
where we used Eqs. (2.1-2) and Eq. (2.5), respectively.
The continuous measurement process (2.1-4) is a Gaussian process with
Itˆo-equations (2.6-8) if, in the limes (2.4), the moments of ∆ˆρ and ∆¯Q
(3.2),(3.3)] satisfy the same algebra as the corresponding Itˆodiﬀerentials dˆρ, d ¯Q [c.f. Eqs. (2.6),(2.7)]. Consequently, we have to prove
the following asymptotics:
(1/∆t)⟨∆ˆρ⟩st →(1/dt)⟨dˆρ⟩st = −i[ˆp2/2m, ˆρ] −1
4γ[ˆq, [ˆq, ˆρ]]
(1/∆t)⟨∆¯Q⟩st →(1/dt)d ¯Q = ⟨ˆq⟩
(1/∆t)⟨∆ˆρ ⊗∆ˆρ⟩st →(1/dt)dˆρ ⊗dˆρ =
2γ{ˆq −¯q, ˆρ} ⊗{ˆq −¯q, ˆρ}
(1/∆t)⟨∆¯Q∆¯Q⟩st →(1/dt)d ¯Qd ¯Q = 1/2γ
(1/∆t)⟨∆¯Q∆ˆρ⟩st →(1/dt)d ¯Qdˆρ =
2{ˆq −¯q, ˆρ}
(1/∆t)⟨higher than 2nd powers of dˆρ and/or d ¯Q⟩st →0 .
The stochastic means on the LHS’s must be taken at time t (i.e. at the
beginning of the interval ∆t). The expressions on the very right have been
calculated by using the stochastic diﬀerential equations (2.6),(2.7) and the
Itˆo-algebra (2.8). To prove the above asymptotical relations, we are going to
evaluate the LHS terms in turn.
As for the ﬁrst one, Eq. (3.4a) is known from previous works. Its proof
is easy because the probability distribution P(¯q) cancels from ⟨∆ˆρ⟩st. Thus,
we refer the reader to the literature1,5 where the following master equation
has been proved:
d/dt⟨∆ˆρ⟩st =
−i[ˆp2/2m, ⟨∆ˆρ⟩st] −1
4γ[ˆq, [ˆq, ⟨∆ˆρ⟩st]] .
Its special case, i.e. when ⟨∆ˆρ⟩st = ψψ† = ˆρ at time t, yields just the Eq.
To prove Eqs. (3.4b-f) we need the form of the distribution P(¯q). In what
follows we exploit translational invariance and choose a special coordinate
system where ⟨ˆq⟩= 0 for the give state ˆρ at time t; this choice makes our
calculations simpler without loss of their generality. Then Eq. (2.3) yields
the following asymptotical expansion:
α/π exp(−α¯q2)[1 + O(α) + O(α2¯q2)] .
In this approximation, Eq. (3.1) yields
⟨¯q⟩st = O(α)
⟨¯q2⟩st = (1/2α) + O(1) .
and, by virtue of Eq. (3.2), we obtain
∆ˆρ = α¯q{ˆq, ˆρ} + O(α2¯q2)
We remind the reader that we have supposed ⟨ˆq⟩= 0.
Let us evaluate each LHS term of Eqs. (3.4b-e) in turn, with the help of
Eqs. (3.3), (3.7ab) and (3.8):
(1/∆t)⟨∆¯Q⟩st →(1/∆t)⟨¯q⟩st∆t →0
(1/∆t)⟨∆ˆρ ⊗∆ˆρ⟩st →(1/∆t)α2⟨¯q2⟩st{ˆq, ˆρ} ⊗{ˆq, ˆρ} →1
2γ{ˆq, ˆρ} ⊗{ˆq, ˆρ}
(1/∆t)⟨∆¯Q∆¯Q⟩st →(1/∆t)⟨¯q2⟩st(∆t)2 →1/2γ
(1/∆t)⟨∆¯Q∆ˆρ⟩st →(1/∆t)α∆t⟨¯q2⟩st{ˆq, ˆρ} →1
2{ˆq, ˆρ} .
Recalling that ⟨ˆq⟩= 0, the Eqs. (3.9) have provided the proof of Eqs. (3.4be). We shall not give a systematic proof to Eq. (3.4f). The reader may
convince himself that the increasing powers of ∆t (or, equivalently, of α) will
not further be compensated by the higher moments of ¯q, and expressions like
1/∆t⟨(∆¯Q)3⟩st, 1/∆t⟨(∆ˆρ⊗∆ˆρ⊗∆ˆρ⟩st, e.t.c. will tend to the zero. Besides,
this is the genuine feature if Gaussian processes.
So we have presented the proof of Itˆo-equations (2.6),(2.7) for the continuous measurement (2.1-4) of a free particle.
4. Possible physical model
We try to construct a physical model whose state would follow the quantum stochastic process described by the QSDE (2.6). Let us suppose that our
test particle is not free but immersed in a parallel stream of light particles
(e. g. of photons). We consider the quantum motion of the probe only in the
transversal plane. This model has been stimulated by a similar discussion
given recently by Joos and Zeh9. (Meanwhile, a more formal treatment has
been shown by Caves and Milburn10).
At the beginning, let us start the probe with a given pure quantum state
It obeys to the free Schr¨odinger-equation (2.1) until the ﬁrst
collision with a photon occurs. The quantum state of the probe bears an
instantaneous random change. It is very crucial to realize that this change
(collapse) may be identiﬁed if we detect the scattered photon.
The set of
possible collapses depends on the photon measuring apparatus. If, e.g., we
observe the scattered photon through an optical lens, we can detect the
current position of the probe.
The non-unitary localization process (2.2)
may, at least qualitatively, represent the collapse of the quantum state where
1/√α is the resolution of the optical device in the transverse plane. The
operator ˆq stands for the transverse coordinate: the probability distribution
of the measured transverse position ¯q of the probe is given by (2.3).
The optimal resolution 1/√α and the repetition frequency 1/∆t of single
measurements depend on the wave number k of photons, on the intensity I
of their stream and on the total cross section σ of photon scattering on the
1/√α ≈1/k,
1/∆t ≈σI .
Now, provided the current wave function of the probe is such that 1) its
transverse width is much smaller than the resolution 1/√α, 2) its relative
change during ∆t in between collisions is small and 3) we consider the probe
properties on time scales larger than ∆t then, we can exploit the property of
the limes (2.4). Hence, one may expect that the QSDE (2.6) will account for
the change of the probe’s quantum state ˆρ and, furthermore, the observed
position ¯q is governed by the stochastic diﬀerential equation (2.7).
It would be interesting to see experimentally the fractal nature of the
observed “trajectory”. We should remember, that this fractality as well as
the validity of the Eqs. (2.6-7) break down at time scales equal or less than
Finally, we brieﬂy discuss the alternative continuous measurement on the
very same system. Let us remove the lens from our measuring apparatus and
observe thus the momentum of the scattered photon. The the quantum state
acquires the unitary change
ˆρ →exp(i∆¯pˆq)ˆρ exp(−i∆¯pˆq)
instead of the collapse (2.2): here ∆¯p is the measured (transverse) momentum transfer whose probability distribution depends on the diﬀerential cross
section of the collision. We note without proof that, in the limes (2.4), the
following QSDE fulﬁls for the quantum state of the probe:
dˆρ = (−i[ˆp2/2m, ˆρ] −1
4γ[ˆq, [ˆq, ˆρ]])dt −i[ˆq, ˆρ]dξ .
This QSDE is linear and it corresponds to unitary evolution of the probe
state in the eﬀective white-noise potential ˆq ˙ξ of the photon “heat bath”, c.f.
Refs. 11, 12.
Note that both QSDE’s (2.6) and (4.3) yield the same master equation
(3.5) since the observation of scattered photon does not make any change to
the statistical operator ⟨ˆρ⟩st of the probe. The general pure state QSDE (i.e.
preserving ˆρ ≡ˆρ2) for the same system has the following stochastic term:
cos β{ˆq −⟨ˆq⟩, ˆρ}dξ −i sin β[ˆq, ˆρ]dξ
with arbitrary real β. In particular, this would correspond to the simultaneous unsharp measurement of the position and the momentum transfer of the
probe. (We mention the non-Gaussian pure state stochastic process13 which
could probably be connected with some even more sophisticated measurement of the scattered photon.)
5. Concluding remarks
The formal extension of the Itˆo-equations (2.6-8) for the continuous measurement of several (not necessarily commuting) operators seems to be straightforward. It would, nevertheless, be desirable to recapitulate the proof starting, e.g., from the mathematical representation of continuous measurements
presented in Refs. 3, 4.
In a forthcoming paper we shall analyze the evolution of the QSDE (2.6)
and we shall show that it possess a unique stationarily localized solution
suitable to represent classical trajectories.
