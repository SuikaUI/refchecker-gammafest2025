Meteoroid bombardment of the Earth-Moon system must have caused catastrophic damage
to the terrestrial ecosphere. However, ancient meteoroid impacts and their relations to
environmental changes are not well understood because of erosion and/or resurfacing
processes on Earth. Here, we investigate the formation ages of 59 lunar craters with fresh
morphologies and diameters greater than approximately 20 km and ﬁrst ﬁnd that 8 of 59
craters were formed simultaneously. Considering the radiometric ages of ejecta from
Copernicus crater and impact glass spherules from various Apollo landing sites, we conclude
that sporadic meteoroid bombardment occurred across the whole Moon at approximately
800 Ma. Based on crater scaling laws and collision probabilities with the Earth and Moon, we
suggest that at least (4–5) × 1016 kg of meteoroids, approximately 30–60 times more than
the Chicxulub impact, must have plunged into the Earth-Moon system immediately before
the Cryogenian, which was an era of great environmental changes.

nderstanding meteoroid bombardment of the Earth system is an issue of both great scientiﬁc interest and practical
importance
potentially
hazardous to the Earth. Since the 541 Ma Cambrian biodiversity
explosion, mass extinction events have occurred at least ﬁve times
(the so-called Big ﬁve events)1, and extra-terrestrial impacts are
considered a potential cause of some of them (e.g., Late Triassic2
and Cretaceous-Palaeogene extinctions3), competing with the
ﬂood basalt eruption-related hypotheses4.
After the ﬁrst discovery of fossil L-chondrites in Ordovician
limestones in Sweden5, abundant L-chondrites, meteorite-tracing
chromite grains and iridium enrichment have been found in
Sweden, England, Scotland, China, and Russia in rocks whose
stratigraphic ages are 470 ~ 480 million years (Ma)6,7. Moreover,
several large terrestrial craters in the Northern Hemisphere have
been found to have radiometric ages of approximately 430 ~ 470
Ma8. Further, approximately two-thirds of ordinary L-chondrites
are known to be heavily shocked and degassed, with 39Ar–40Ar
ages near 470 Ma9. Therefore, it is generally considered that the
L-chondrite parent body suffered a major impact approximately
470 million years ago and was catastrophically disrupted, causing
a very large meteoroid shower on Earth for several million
years10. Recently, Schmitz et al.11 suggested that the extraordinary
amounts of dust during >2 Myr cooled the Earth and triggered
Ordovician icehouse conditions, sea-level fall, and major faunal
turnovers related to the Great Ordovician Biodiversiﬁcation
Event. However, to date, other ancient meteoroid impacts and
their relations to environmental changes have not been well
understood because of erosion and/or resurfacing processes
Another way to reveal ancient meteoroid impacts on Earth is to
investigate the lunar crater record because there is less weathering
and erosion on the Moon. The lunar orbiter, Kaguya provides us
a new insight that disruption of asteroid had occurred and
formed the several craters larger than 20 km simultaneously on
the Moon approximately 800 Ma. Based on crater scaling laws
and collision probabilities with the Earth and Moon, at least
(4–5) × 1016 kg of meteoroids, approximately 30–60 times more
than the Chicxulub impact, must have struck the Earth, immediately before the Cryogenian, which was an era of great environmental and biological changes.

measurement
wellestablished technique to derive relative and absolute ages of
planetary surfaces12; thus, the density of 0.1–1 km-diameter
craters in the ejecta of a large crater (>20 km) potentially gives the
formation age of the large crater itself. In this study, we investigate the formation age distribution of 59 lunar craters with fresh
morphology and diameters larger than approximately 20 km
(Fig. 1) using the software tool craterstats13. Typical craters and
small craters counted for their crater size-frequency distribution
measurement are shown in Fig. 2. Here, we select and investigate
the regions where there is no pond (impact melt region) to avoid
the target property effects that may cause craters formed in
impact melts to be smaller than those in ejecta, as discussed by13.
First, we estimate the formation ages of individual craters using
the conventional constant ﬂux model over 3 billion years (another
model is discussed later). Table 1 summarizes the estimated
formation ages of 59 lunar craters with fresh morphology. The
remarkable new ﬁnding is that eight of 59 craters, including
Copernicus, are concentrated at approximately 660 Ma, and the
weighted mean is 658 ± 16 Ma (Fig. 3b). The spatial distribution
of these craters seems to be slightly concentrated in the equatorial
plane, but there is no signiﬁcant difference between the far and
near sides (Fig. 1).
To evaluate the probability of the observed concentration of
crater ages, we perform a simple test using Monte Carlo
simulation. We assume that craters are created with uniform
probability within an age range from 3.0 Ga to 0 Ga and compute
the ages of the 59 craters using a uniformly distributed pseudorandom number. The procedure is iterated 100,000 times. The
results show that the possibility that seven of the 59 craters
formed at the same time (for 50 Ma from 630 Ma to 680 Ma) by
chance is 0.69%, where the 54S161E crater (747 ± 92 Ma) is
masked because it is an obvious outlier with large uncertainties (if
the 4S161E crater is included, the possibility that eight of the 59
craters formed during a 100 Ma interval by chance is 7%). From
these considerations, we conclude that sporadic meteorite
bombardment occurred across the whole Moon, possibly due to
the disruption of asteroids, analogous to the Ordovician meteorite
According to Shibaike et al.14, the mass of an impactor can be
estimated from the density of the impactor, the density of the
crust, the velocity of the impactor and the diameter of the crater
(see “Methods” for details). Assuming a density of near-Earth
asteroids (1.29 g cm−3 for C-type asteroid Ryugu15, 1.9 g cm−3
for S-type asteroid Itokawa16 and 2.7 g cm−3 for S-type asteroid
Eros17) and a relative velocity of 20 km sec−1 of Earth-crossing
asteroids to the Moon18,19, the masses and sizes of the impactors
for eight lunar craters formed at 660 Ma are calibrated (see
Table 2). As a result, the total mass of the asteroid shower on the
Moon is estimated to be (1.3–1.6) × 1015 kg, corresponding to an
impactor 10–13 km in diameter.
Consideration of absolute age of clustered craters. To date, the
lunar impact history has been well investigated based on lunar
impact glasses collected by the Apollo/Luna missions and/or
lunar meteorites. The age of Copernicus crater is generally taken
as ~800 Ma based on both crater chronology20 and the radiometric dating of 12033 brecciated soil, which is considered to
consist of ejecta from Copernicus crater21,22. The discrepancy in
crater age between 800 Ma20 and 660 Ma in this study is due to
the difference in the selected area to be counted as follows. In fact,
we investigated the same area as Hiesinger et al.20, giving an age
of 797 ± 52 Ma, whereas Hiesinger et al.20 also reported ages of
678 ± 81 Ma for the area observed by KAGUYA CE1 and 678 ±
270 Ma for the Copernicus ray. In addition, we investigate other
areas around Copernicus crater (ﬂoor, ejecta area and melt region
near central peak), giving ca. 660 Ma (Fig. 4). All of these results
mean that there is no discrepancy in counting and calibration
between previous work20 and this study. We also realize that the
selected area with an age of 800 Ma is close to the centre of
Copernicus crater and tends to be affected by secondary craters,
so a counting method yielding a younger age of 660 Ma is correct
for Copernicus crater. Note that the most important of the new
ﬁndings is that eight craters, including Copernicus, show identical
relative ages based on a constant ﬂux model.
On the other hand, the absolute age of Copernicus crater is
considered to be 800 Ma based on the radiometric ages of 12033
brecciated soil collected from the ejecta of Copernicus crater21,22.
In addition, Zellner et al. 23 recently reported that
40Ar/39Ar data for impact spherules from Apollo 12, 14, 16,
and 17 samples show an 800 Ma spike, similar to that of the
12033 breccia, and concluded that there must have been a
transient increase in the global lunar impact ﬂux at 800 Ma other
than Copernicus crater, in the context of diverse compositional
ranges and sample locations of impact glass spherules. Such
geochemical observations of simultaneous global lunar impacts

recorded in Apollo samples well match the coincidence of (at
least) eight crater formations derived from our observations, of
which the probability is 0.69%. From these considerations, we
infer that these two observations must be related to each other
and newly propose a constant with a spike model of ~800 Ma
instead of a conventional constant model (details of a new model
are discussed in the next section).
This scenario in which sporadic asteroid showers did not occur
at 660 Ma but at 800 Ma is also supported by recent LRO
observations and/or numerical simulations of the asteroid
families as follows24–27. Based on the temperature of large
impact ejecta with crater sizes larger than 10 km in diameter,
Mazrouei et al.24 reported that there is no evidence of a sporadic
peak at approximately 660 Ma, although they found that the
production rate of D ≥10 km lunar craters was 2–3 times higher
over the last ~290 Myr. However, the age of 800 Ma is very close
to the limit of resolution shown in Fig. 3 in Mazrouei et al.24, so
contradiction
with the 800 Ma
Furthermore, numerical simulation of the orbits of asteroid
families also provides crucial chronological information about the
impact ﬂux to the inner solar system. A recent investigation of the
dynamics of the asteroid family and the best available Yarkovsky
measurement suggest25 that the breakup of 847 Agnia (669–1003
Ma) and/or 480 Hansa (763–950 Ma) was related to the sporadic
asteroid shower at 660 Ma. However, it is known that these
families are not sizable enough and/or not well enough positioned
to produce the sporadic asteroid shower, including Copernicus
crater with a diameter of 93 km, for which impactor is expected to
be 10 km in diameter (Table 2). Moreover, the Agnia family is
located near the 5:2 resonance, where the probability of a
projectile hitting the Moon is very low (~10−5)26. The Hansa
family also has difﬁculty producing an impactor of 10 km for
Copernicus because it is located at high inclinations near the 3:1
and 8:3 resonances. However, the Eulalia family, whose age is 830
[+370, −100] Ma, could potentially have produced an impact
spike at ~800 Ma. According to Bottke et al.27, when the parent
body of Eulalia was disrupted, a large share of the sizable family
was directly injected into the 3:1 resonance at low inclinations.
This disruption certainly could have produced an impact spike on
terrestrial planets and/or their satellites inside the asteroid belt.
Interestingly, the Eulalia family is a carbonaceous chondrite
family and is considered to be the parent body of near-Earth Ctype asteroids, such as Bennu and Ryugu27. Such an asteroid
shower must have contaminated the lunar surface with volatile
elements. This scenario is harmonized with (i) the observation of
H2O in Copernicus crater that may reﬂect retention of volatiles
from hydrous impactors28; (ii) the scenario that may have been
formed by a cometary nucleus, 4 km in diameter based on
geochemistry of the 12033 breccia29; and (iii) recent KAGUYA
remote-sensing observation of persistent C+ emitted from the
whole Moon, which is signiﬁcantly larger than inﬂuxes due to
solar wind and/or current micrometeoroid accretion30 and
suggests that the lunar surface might have been contaminated
by volatile-rich impactors in the past.
Crater age distribution by the 800 Ma spike model. It is obvious
that the break-up of large asteroids increases not only the large
(>20 km) crater production rate but also the small (0.1–1 km)
crater production rate. From these considerations, we propose the
new simplest model: a constant ﬂux with a spike between 830 and
800 Ma for small craters (0.1–1 km), as shown in Fig. 4 (hereafter,
we call this concept the 800 Ma spike model). The basic idea is
that the crater counting age of Copernicus crater must be identical to the radiometric age of 800 Ma and that the ﬂuxes before
and after the sporadic spike at ~800 Ma were constant. Although
the duration time of the spike is slightly uncertain, we assume
that this duration was 30 Ma (from 830 Ma to 800 Ma), based on
the break-up age of Eulalia26 and the radiometric age of Copernicus crater21,22 and/or the deviation of eight clustered ages (658
± 16 Ma) for a constant model. Figure 5 illustrates the difference
between the conventional constant ﬂux model and the 800 Ma
spike model. The constant ﬂux of the new spike model is 75%
(=663 Ma/800 Ma) of the conventional constant ﬂux model, and
the ﬂux between 800 Ma and 830 Ma is 23 times higher than that
in other eras (Fig. 5a) to ensure that the total crater production
over 3 billion years is identical for both models, as shown in
As a result, the modiﬁed age distribution shows that 16 of
the 59 craters coincide with that of Copernicus crater within
the analytical certainties (Fig. 3b, Table 2), although the large
(>20 km) crater production rate and the small (0.1–1 km) crater
production rate might be coupled in this model. However, the
estimated total masses are not signiﬁcantly changed ((1.3–1.6) ×
1015 kg for the constant ﬂux model and (1.8–2.3) × 1015 kg for the
800 Ma spike model) because Copernicus crater is dominant
among the eight coincident craters (by the constant model) and
the 17 coincident craters (by the spike model). Therefore, the
latter discussion on the total mass estimation of the impactor is
not affected by the choice of a ﬂux model with/without the spike.

Moreover, it should also be noted that the slopes of the lines <300
Ma in both models in Fig. 6 are gentler than those of other eras,
which is quite consistent with the previous study that the
production rate of lunar craters (>10 km) has been 2–3 times
higher over the last ~290 Myr, which is derived from an
independent approach based on the temperature of large impact

suggest that an active water cycle exists on the Moon and that
hydrated soil is present under the desiccated soil layer of several
centimetres over the Moon surface. In particular, Li and
Milliken31 discuss that the Copernicus crater exhibits high water
content that may reﬂect the retention of volatiles from hydrous
impactors according to the Moon Mineralogy Mapper. In
addition, we recently found that C+ is persistently emitted from
the whole of the Moon as detected by the lunar orbiter KAGUYA
and that this ﬂux is signiﬁcantly larger than the inﬂux estimated
from solar wind and/or current micrometeoroid accretion30.
These observations suggest that volatile elements are ubiquitous
over the lunar surface and that the Moon is currently in the
process of losing volatiles (water, carbon, etc.), although when
and how the surface of the Moon attained and/or retained such
volatiles has been enigmatic. Assuming the CI-like chemical
composition (a few wt.% of carbon and H2O), our scenario
predicts that a C-type asteroid shower at 800 Ma must have
supplied ~1014 kg of carbon and H2O to the lunar surface. This
new paradigm undoubtedly should place new constraints on the
history of lunar volatiles.
Estimated ﬂux on the Earth. Since the Earth–Moon system has
been co-evolving over 4.5 billion years, this new ﬁnding provides
us with crucial insight into the Earth–Moon system because
asteroid showers must have occurred not only on the Moon but
also on the Earth. Based on the probability ratio of collisions with
the Earth and the Moon of 23:133, we conclude that a mass of
(4–5) × 1016 kg (corresponding to a diameter of ~30–40 km and
~30–60 times greater in mass than the Chicxulub asteroid
impactor34) must have collided successively on the Earth at
~800 Ma, i.e., immediately before the Cryogenian (720–635 Ma),
which was an era of great environmental and biological changes35,36. To date, however, no direct geological evidence of a
large-scale impact in the Neoproterozoic has been found37.
remarkable
concentrations
platinum-group elements (PGE) anomalies, such as those at the
K–T boundary34, have not been found, although only the Marinoan glaciation (650–635 Ma) is characterized by increased
concentrations of Ir38,39. The straightforward interpretation is
that the following large-scale Neoproterozoic glaciations, the socalled Snowball Earth (that is, the Kaigas-Sturtian glaciation from
730 to 700 Ma and the Marinoan glaciation) and/or their deglaciation processes, might have erased a signiﬁcant part of the
earlier geological and/or geochemical history, as discussed by40.
To date, the impact history and subsequent effects on the
environment in the Neoproterozoic and Cryogenic have not been
understood because terrestrial craters are not well preserved due
to erosion. Koeberl and Ivanov41 recently discussed the mechanical effects of one impact of an asteroid 5–10 km in diameter on
the Snowball Earth environment, suggesting that the products of
impact (mainly water vapour) could be quickly distributed over a
substantial part of the globe, inﬂuencing the global circulation
(e.g., facilitating cloud formation), because one impact cratering
event (shock waves and impact crater formation) might produce
much dust that entered the atmosphere and might have caused
albedo changes. Recently, Schmitz et al.11 noted that the
Ordovician meteorite shower should have triggered the mid-
Ordovician ice age based on the sizes of the remaining terrestrial
craters. Thus, large asteroid showers should inﬂuence the global
ecosphere in some ways, although mechanisms are not well
realized because of the unknown characteristics of the dust, e.g.,
size, albedo, mineralogy, and chemical composition.
Interestingly, Reinhard et al.42 found that the average P content
of late Tonian samples is more than four times greater than that
of pre-Cryogenian samples and noted that a fundamental shift in
the phosphorus cycle may have occurred during the late
Proterozoic Eon after 800 Ma (until 635 Ma). Our new ﬁnding
suggests that ~1014 kg of extra-terrestrial P should have accreted
across the Earth assuming CI chondrite composition (P = 0.1 wt.
%) at 800 Ma, which is one order of magnitude higher than the
total P amount of the modern sea (assuming that the volume of
modern seas is 13.5 × 108 km3 and the concentration of P is ~3
μg/litre). In general, large-scale changes in marine biogeochemical
are undoubtedly forced by tectonic and magmatic
processes and chemical weathering of the continental crust, but
our new ﬁnding suggests that the ﬂux of extra-terrestrial

animals45,46. Thus, lunar crater chronology provides new insight

The method of crater size-frequency measurement. The model ages of the lunar
craters were determined by crater size-frequency measurements on ejecta blankets
of the craters using image data obtained by the Terrain Camera (TC) onboard
SELENE. The lunar explorer SELENE (KAGUYA) was launched on 14 September
2007 and had a nominal observation of 1 year at an altitude of 100 km47. The TC is
a panchromatic push-broom imager with two optical heads (TC1 and TC2) to
acquire stereo data for the entire surface of the Moon with an average resolution of
10 m/pixel. The details of the instruments have been published elsewhere48,49.
The technique of crater size-frequency measurement has been described in
detail in several papers50–52. Therefore, we brieﬂy present the procedure. Based on
the simple idea that older surfaces accumulate more craters, the relative age is
determined by measuring the cumulative crater frequency at a reference diameter
(usually > 1 km), where the measurement of the crater size-frequency distribution
(CSFD) is carried out with remote sensing image data. The cratering chronology
formulated by relating crater frequencies to the radiometric ages of Apollo and
Luna samples enables us to convert the crater frequency into an absolute
model age.
We used images that are map-projected in a transverse Mercator projection
with a resolution of 10 m/pixel at the central meridian of the projection because
this projection introduces little distortion in a narrow area. Crater counting was

performed within the continuous ejecta out to one crater radius from the crater
rim. In this study, we eliminated obvious secondary craters based on their
morphological characteristics, such as chain craters, elliptical craters, and clusters.
In general, self-secondary cratering would cause the estimated ages to be older
than the actual ages53,54. Although self-secondary craters54,55 may be included in
our counting, the effect of self-secondary craters on the age determination is
sufﬁciently small to ignore. The crater frequency (the density of craters larger than
1 km in diameter) of Giordano Bruno, which is the youngest crater among those
investigated in this study, is 4.9 × 10−6 km−2, which is considered the maximum
ﬂux value of self-secondary craters if the age is zero (in actuality, this value is the
summation of both self-secondary craters and cumulative craters after Giordano
Bruno formation). Thus, the maximum contribution of self-secondary craters is
~100 times smaller than that corresponding to 660 Ma (5.5 × 10−4 km−2),
suggesting that self-secondary crates should be <1/100 of the small craters counted
on the continuous ejecta for craters with a model age of 660 Ma. Therefore, selfsecondary craters do not affect the discussion of this paper.
We used the lunar standard CSFD and the cratering chronology model
proposed by Neukum and co-workers55–57 to obtain the absolute model age from
the CSFD measurement. More recently, the standard CSFD and the chronology
model have been updated52,57. However, in the diameter range (a few hundred
metres to a few tens of metres) and the age range (0.1 Ga) used in this study, the
differences between the models are insigniﬁcant42 and produce only slight
differences in the estimated ages58. Therefore, we adopted the Neukum model55 in
this study. The model ages from crater counts are principally limited by the
statistical error. The statistical error of individual data points in our crater
frequency measurements is mostly <30% (1 sigma).
Estimation of the size and mass of the impactor. According to Shibaike et al.14
(originally from Abramov et al.59), the mass of the impactor can be estimated from
the density of the impactor, the density of the crust, the velocity of the impactor
and the diameter of craters as follows:
D ¼ 1:37ρ0:22=3
v0:44g0:22m0:26
where ρi and ρt are the densities of the impactor and the crust and v, m, and g are the
impact speed, impactor mass, and gravity, respectively. Assuming a density of near-
Earth asteroids (1.29 g cm−3 for C-type asteroid Ryugu15, 1.9 g cm−3 for S-type
asteroid Itokawa16 and 2.7 g cm−3 for S-type asteroid Eros17) and a relative velocity
of 20 km s−1 for Earth-crossing asteroids to the Moon18,19, the mass and size of the
impactors for 17 lunar craters that coincide with the formation of Copernicus crater
are shown in Table 2. It should be noted that these parameters do not affect the
conclusion much, even if the density changes from 2.5 to 3.5 g cm−3 and the velocity
changes from 10 to 20 km s−1. Although numbers of smaller craters <20 km in
diameter would increase, the observed craters with sizes of 35–93 km are the
main contributor to the total mass of bombardment (e.g., masses of the impactors
for a D = 10 km crater and a D = 3 km crater are 1/100 and 1/106 of those for a
D = 35 km crater, respectively).
