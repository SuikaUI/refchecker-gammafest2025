Online or face-to-face instruction? A
qualitative study on the electrocardiogram
course at the University of Ulm to examine
why students choose a particular format
Oliver Keis1*, Claudia Grab1, Achim Schneider1 and Wolfgang Öchsner1,2
Background: Since the introduction of the e-learning electrocardiogram (ECG) course ‘ECG Online’ into the curriculum
at the University of Ulm, a small but relatively constant number of students have decided not to participate in
the online course but to attend the face-to-face course, although the content of both courses is identical. The
present study examined why students prefer one format or the other.
Methods: In a qualitative research approach, ten medical students were questioned in a guided interview. At the
time of the survey the interviewees were enrolled in the 7th to 10th semesters. Among the respondents, 2 had
participated only in the face-to-face ECG course, 4 only in the online version and 4 in both the face-to-face and
the online course.
Results: Interestingly, the very factors associated with e-learning – and always praised as advantages of it – are
viewed critically by the students. Thus, although the 24-h access to learning content was consistently evaluated
positively, the unlimited availability (lack of expiry date) was not seen as conducive to learning. The lack of fixed
time constraints and the attendant lack of pressure were important reasons why some of the students had discontinued
the online course prematurely. A similar distinction was seen in the flexibility of location for e-learning, because the very
obligation to be physically present on a particular day at a fixed time led to a higher degree of commitment to courses
and a willingness to actually attend the course until the end. In addition, if the content has a high degree of perceived
professional relevance face-to-face courses are preferred because they offer the possibility of direct interaction.
Conclusions: Even though the small sample size limits the generalisability of the results, our findings indicate that when
developing online courses students’ needs could be better met if measures were included to strengthen extrinsic and
intrinsic motivation and formats were favoured that enable students to have a minimum level of personal interaction
with the lecturer.

Background
The increasing introduction of e-learning formats into
medical education has resulted in many studies; numerous authors have thereby established that in medical
education the learning outcome through e-learning
formats is at least equal to that of traditional methods
 or that e-learning contributes additional positive
effects to traditional methods . In addition to the
findings of these outcome-oriented studies, and of more
relevance from the perspective of educational planners,
the following advantages of e-learning formats have been
cited in the literature: support of individual and community learning, access to a high number of students, greater
flexibility in learning through personal choice of time and
location and good availability and cost-effectiveness .
However, possible disadvantages of certain e-learning
formats have also been shown recently. In her study on
economics students, Wigger determined that e-learning
students show poorer professional competence than
conventionally taught students. In this study, students
evaluated working independently, which they are unaccustomed to, and the time required as negative .
outcome of e-learning courses and the perspective of
educational planners, in the current study we decided to
look at a different perspective, i.e. that of the students.
Teaching courses are usually offered as either a face-toface or an online course or in a blended learning format.
However, our university offers a special configuration:
one of the elective courses at the Faculty of Medicine at
the University of Ulm, the electrocardiogram (ECG)
course, is offered to all medical students in the 7th to
10th semesters as an e-learning and face-to-face course.
The subject matter of both formats is identical. Students
are free to choose either format or both, although not
simultaneously; the choice of format, or the choice not
to take this elective course, has no effect on the progress
of students’ studies. The course communicates basic
information about the resting ECG and the interpretation
of ECG curves. Experience has shown that about half the
students in semesters 7 to 10 attend one of the two
formats of the ECG course during the course of their
studies. On average, about 12 students enrol for the faceto-face course per semester, while approximately 160
students participate in the online course.
We used the fact that the ECG course is offered in two
different formats to examine the following questions
from the students’ perspective: (1) What are the reasons
why students choose the face-to-face or online format of a
course when the content of both formats is identical? (2)
What conclusions are to be drawn from these preferences
for the design of e-learning formats that better meet
students’ needs? We hoped that the availability of one
course in two different formats and the possibility to
examine the students’ perspective would allow us to
obtain first-hand insights to support the further development and design of our e-learning tools.
We decided to focus on the students rather than
outcome-related criteria, such as examination results, to
obtain information on students’ subjective perspectives
and opinions on the two formats.
Participants
In January 2015 we e-mailed all medical students in the
7th to 10th semesters at the University of Ulm who took
the online (N = 317) or face-to-face (N = 23) ECG
elective course during the summer semester 2014 or
the winter semester 2014/2015 (N total = 340). In the
corresponding periods, a total of 674 students were
enrolled in semesters 7 to 10.
We were able to recruit 10 students into the study (3
males; 7 females). Students attended the 7th (n = 1), 8th
(n = 2), 9th (n = 5) and 10th (n = 2) semester, respectively.
All participants had previously participated in at least
one curricular computer-assisted learning programme as
part of their course. Furthermore, all interviewees stated
that in both their university and private environments
they met the technical requirements necessary for
participating in an online course.
Participants provided written informed consent after
being assured that their data would remain anonymous for data analysis. They received € 30.00 for
participating in the study.
The ethics committee of the University of Ulm
confirmed that no approval was required for this study.
Curriculum
The online ECG course consists of 12 audio visual
lessons of about 1 h duration and 2 to 4 online exercises
(usually ECG interpretations) that are provided for each
lesson. The aim of the course is to learn about the basics
of the resting ECG and its interpretation for clinical
purposes. Once a learning unit has been completely
worked through (including the exercises) the next lesson
is released (including sample solutions for exercises). For
questions, students may contact the course instructor
per e-mail. Completed e-learning lessons are available at
any time to all students participating in the online
course to allow for practise and repetition.
The content of the face-to-face course is identical to
that of the online course. It consists of 12 lectures
(90 min each) dealing with the basics and interpretation of
the resting ECG and ECG curves. Students participating
in the face-to-face course receive detailed notes on each
Keis et al. BMC Medical Education 17:194
 
lecture and have access to the lecture slides via the university learning platform.
After completing the full course, students can take a
voluntary written final examination. If they pass the
examination, they receive a certificate of participation
(optional ECG certificate). This examination is summative and held jointly for all students at the end of the
course, independent of the chosen course format. The
mark scheme is shared with students. Though dropouts
and assessment performance are not routinely documented, on average, about 25% of the students who
enrol in the online course take the examination.
Data collection
We used a qualitative research approach to investigate the
reasons why students had chosen the online or face-toface format of the course. We chose a semi-structured
interview as the evaluation procedure because, in addition
to allowing open questions and answers, it also ensured
comparability of the interviews .
The interview questions were compiled by means of the
SPSS method of Helfferich (SPSS stands for the
German words ‘sammeln, prüfen, sortieren, subsumieren’,
i.e. collect, check, sort, prioritise); the resulting interview
guide consisted of 12 questions (see Table 1).
Two interviewers conducted the 20- to 30-min interviews according to recommendations in the literature
 . The interviewers were not involved in teaching the
ECG course, nor were there any dependencies between
interviewers
interviewees.
interviews
recorded on tape and subsequently transcribed and
anonymised. In accordance with Lamnek , transcriptions were conducted by two independent assistants
who had not been involved in the interviews and who
were trained beforehand.
In addition, study participants were sent a brief online
questionnaire asking about the technical prerequisites
for online courses (e.g. ‘Do you think the university’s
technical equipment is adequate to allow you to participate in online courses?’) and the assessment of the
students’ own e-learning competence (‘How do you rate
your competence in dealing with e-learning formats?’).
Participants were also asked to specify their sex and
current semester and whether they had their own
computer equipment.
Data analysis
The interviews were evaluated following the qualitative
content analysis according to Mayring .
Interview responses were clustered into 6 categories,
which in turn were assigned to the two superordinate
topic areas ‘General advantages and disadvantages of the
two formats’ and ‘Personal reasons for choosing a
particular format’ (see Table 1). The first topic area
required the students to give their perspective on a
higher level of abstraction, whereas the second reflected
their individual perspective.
Although we collected both qualitative and quantitative data, the present paper focuses on the qualitative
findings. Quantitative data are supplementary and will
be mentioned as appropriate in the sections Discussion
and Conclusion.
Among the interviewees, 6 had participated in the faceto-face course and 4 in the online version; 2 of those

who participated in the face-to-face course had previously completed the online course and 2 had previously
discontinued it. Thus, a total of 8 interviewees could
provide information on the online course and 6 on the
face-to-face course.
General strengths and weaknesses of the two formats
Reasons named by students for and against online and
face-to-face formats
Many of the advantages and disadvantages of the two
formats listed in Table 2 have already been discussed
elsewhere . The fact that three respondents referred
to the supportive character of the face-to-face courses is
therefore all the more interesting. Thus, the fixed
location and time of this format were experienced as
positive because they made students commit to participating and made them study the topic.
In addition, presence of the lecturer was perceived as
increasing attentiveness,
especially when the subject
matter was difficult. The prospect of being asked directly
in the face-to-face course, but not being able to answer,
motivated students to adequately study the course topics.
‘[...] face-to-face with the lecturer, of course you don’t
really want to lay yourself open (breathes in) [...] so
then I always try [...] so always, always try to be up to
date [...].’ (Interview 9, authors’ translation)
This effect could be strengthened by the attention in small
group teaching, which is much more beneficial for attentiveness, not least because there are ‘fewer possibilities to
hide’ (Interview 7, authors’ translation) (6 mentions).
This finding also corresponded with several statements that the greater necessity of self-initiative or selfdiscipline
negative (4 mentions), as was the lack of interaction
possibilities (6 mentions).
Therefore, when considering the question of the ideal
characteristics of online courses, the integration of exercise or control tasks (with feedback) (7 mentions) and
the opportunity for personal interaction with a direct
contact person (4 mentions) play a decisive role. An
assessment of course participation (e.g. in the form of a
mark) would also add value and thus ultimately increase
motivation on the part of the students.
With regard to time structure, one respondent’s comment is noteworthy: the student stated that in an ideal
online course the actual central element of online
courses, i.e. the ability to access the learning content as
often and for as long as desired, would have to give way
to a limit on the time that the material can be accessed.
The ‘time constraint’ (Interview 2, authors’ translation)
would create a greater commitment to studying the
content of the various lessons.
Thus, structure-related factors, such as opportunities
for interaction, marking work or fixed timeframes, are
essential for an ideal online offering because they can
support the students’ self-regulation.
Choice of format from the perspective of educational
After changing their perspective to that of an educational planner, the respondents named the following
areas as being more suited to the face-to-face format:
teaching the compulsory curriculum, practical skills,
content with high professional relevance and topics
students perceive as difficult. Their preference for this
format can be attributed in particular to the opportunity
for direct interaction in the form of communication or
feedback (4 mentions).
‘For me a bit of exchange is part of studying, so with
both teaching staff and fellow students, um, and I think
an online course just simply doesn’t offer that. So, even if
there's a chat or something like that, only a fraction of

the, the participants use it, because a lot of them just
somehow work through it in front of the computer and
then do something else as quickly as possible. Um, I think
you remember things better when you learn in a group.’
(Interview 2, authors’ translation)
On the other hand, the online format was preferable to
face-to-face teaching in large groups (4 mentions) and for
topics with a high proportion of theoretical knowledge
(e.g. pharmacology; two mentions) or little clinicalpractical relevance, e.g. ‘statistical stuff like biometry’
(Interview 1, author’s translation; two mentions).
In addition, as educational planners several respondents would offer online courses as a preparation or
supplement to face-to-face courses or as an alternative to
face-to-face courses that have a limited number of seats.
Required behaviour change depending on the format
The interviewees stated that under certain conditions
their choice could be influenced.
Switch from face-to-face to online: Making more of the
online formats mandatory in the curriculum – as
opposed to voluntary – was named as a prerequisite for
someone to switch to this format (2 mentions). Instead
of being completely time independent, fixed timeframes
should be specified for working through the topics.
Another proposal was to integrate blended learning
elements into the online format, e.g. in the form of
classroom-based sessions in which application examples
are used (see also Table 2).
Switch from online to face-to-face: Educational planners would have to ensure that the face-to-face format
takes advantage of the special features of this format,
such as enabling direct contact with patients. Also,
because the face-to-face format has a fixed time and place,
the effort of attending would have to be minimized by
optimising the timetable (see also Table 2).
A switch to the face-to-face format was considered to
be worthwhile if the group size is small, ‘like these
seminars for up to 20 people’ (Interview 4, author’s
translation), because a smaller group would promote
active participation by the students.
Personal reasons for choosing a particular format
Content-related factors
As regards the motivation for participating in the ECG
respondents
content was ‘highly relevant’ and that the compulsory
curriculum did not include any courses on the topic. For
example, in interview 4 the student stated the following:
‘[... so I think later on as a doctor you should evaluate
ECGs, no matter in which discipline you are, you
should be able to evaluate the most important things
in an ECG, that was my motivation. And because it is
not in the regular curriculum, I took it as an elective
course.]’ (Interview 4, authors’ translation)
Students experience the relevance of the topic of ECG in
the practical phases of their degree. Their own uncertainty and the uncertainty they perceive in others in
dealing with different aspects of the topic motivated
them to attend the course and examine the subject matter. The respective statements were identical for both
course formats and a preference for one format or the
other could not be derived from them.
The majority of students (7 out of 10) considered the
topic of ECG to be difficult, complex and multifaceted.
Several participants stated that the face-to-face course
was the more appropriate format for difficult topics.
‘So if, if I, um, assume that a topic will be very difficult
then I would also decide again for the face-to-face
course.’ (Interview 10, authors’ translation)
Thus, there was a trend to associate the difficulty of the
topic with the choice of format.
Learning style factors
Nine of the 10 respondents named actions such as notetaking, writing excerpts / summaries, etc., as important
additional parts of their personal learning strategy,
regardless of the format chosen. Two interviewees
showed a genuine aversion to learning on the computer
for longer periods (one of them wandered off topic when
working on the computer and the other found it too
strenuous to read on the monitor).
However, the factors listed in the category cluster
‘Learning style factors’ (learning type, teaching methods,
exchange with others, strategic learning planning) had
no decisive influence on the choice of format.
Personal reasons for making a particular decision
Online format – Flexible time allocation, repeatability &
individual learning speed
The two main reasons for choosing the online format
were given as the ability to freely allocate time and the
ability to repeat the subject matter as often as desired.
The greater flexibility of the online course, e.g. with
regard to learning speed, was also rated positively.
‘[...] the nice thing about the online course is [...] that I
can listen to it as often as I want. If I just noticed that
parts of it were going too fast and, um, ( ) I can pause it
now, I can write things down, I can carry on again, I can
listen to a lecture twice, um, ( ) just as I like. One is
simply more flexible.’ (Interview 8, authors’ translation)
Keis et al. BMC Medical Education 17:194
 
Corresponding with the statements regarding the online
format, the lack of time flexibility and the greater effort
of participating (e.g. travel expenses) were rated negatively for face-to-face courses.
Face-to-face course - external control, commitment and
interaction with lecturers
The negative side of flexible time allocation, however,
was also apparent, because the two students who had
discontinued the online course indicated the lack of a
fixed time (‘lack of pressure’) as the reason for stopping.
‘[...] so I did the online course last year, but at lesson
six, what with one thing and another, you plan to do
it, but then if there isn’t any pressure on you, um, then
it was exam period and then at some point I
abandoned it.’ (Interview 4, authors’ translation)
This statement, characterizing the lack of pressure in the
online course as a disadvantage is noteworthy with
regards to the remarks of three participants in the faceto-face course, who perceived the prevailing degree of
external control (‘compulsory attendance’), accompanied
by a higher degree of commitment, as a positive aspect.
‘[...] and then I thought, well, for, for someone like me
who sometimes simply does not have the discipline to
stay on the ball completely without, um, the external
control, such as appearing every week, for example,
[...] in that case a face-to-face course simply makes
more sense and so that’s what I did.’ (Interview 9,
authors’ translation)
In addition, three participants in the face-to-face course
rated the opportunity for direct interaction with the
lecturer in the form of questions and discussions as a
key decision-making criterion for their choice of that
format. This interaction would allow a more comprehensive understanding than the online course:
‘[...] l enjoyed having some exercises here and there [...]
that we talked about it in the seminar, that we
received feedback [...].’ (Interview 10, authors’
translation)
Last but not least, personal recommendations by older
students played a role. On the one hand these students
stressed the teaching activities of the responsible lecturer
(2 mentions) and, on the other hand, they warned of the
higher risk of discontinuing the online course, because
of its non-committal character.
The choice of format was therefore primarily based on
the weight students placed on the factors ‘flexible time
management, repeatability and individual learning speed’
of the online format versus ‘more external control and
commitment, as well as interaction with lecturers’ in the
face-to-face format. These factors and their relative
weighting were influenced by personal experience or
were passed on by older fellow students.
Discussion
As the analysis of our interviews shows, from the
students’ perspective the aspects of time and location
flexibility, which are always mentioned in connection
with online courses, need to be considered in a nuanced
way: although access to the learning content regardless
of the time of day was rated positively by all students,
the lack of a time limit for the availability of the learning
content was viewed critically. Thus, two interviewees
named the lack of a fixed timeframe (e.g. by when
lessons had to be completed) and the associated lack of
pressure or extrinsic motivation as the main reason why
they had discontinued the online ECG course and why
they subsequently decided to take
the face-to-face
course. The non-binding nature of the online course
therefore requires the students to have a high degree of
initiative and discipline in order to actually complete the
course. Despite the perceived high professional relevance
of the topic ECG and consequently of the learning
content, many students do not achieve this level of
intrinsic motivation and self-regulation (as is indicated
as well by the low participation rate in the final examination), possibly because the high relevance is counteracted by competing or more extrinsically motivated
(e.g. mandatory
attendance at face-to-face instruction and compulsory
appointments). Strengthening the ability to learn in a
self-regulated way has long been central to curricular
development in medicine , although studies emphasise
that it still needs to be enhanced .
The students viewed e-learning’s flexibility of location
in a similarly differentiated way to time flexibility. It is
the obligation to be present on a particular day at a fixed
time at a fixed location that results in face-to-face
courses requiring a higher degree of commitment both
concerning adequate preparation of the learning content
and willingness to complete the course. This finding is
strengthened by the additional online survey: students
indicated that preference is given to on-site teaching,
even though all respondents have the necessary technical
prerequisites to participate in online courses.
In addition, because of the personal feedback students
received in the face-to-face course we assume that they
perceived themselves as being more self-efficacious than
those in the online course who did not receive individual
feedback. This assumption is supported by research
showing individual feedback to increase students’ selfefficacy . In particular the social and emotional
Keis et al. BMC Medical Education 17:194
 
support provided by lecturers and students by means of
direct feedback can help to strengthen learners’ confidence in their own skills – even though self-reported
estimates of competence are an unreliable measure of
competence . The experienced self-efficacy itself
leads to more self-motivation, effort and perseverance
 . If nothing else, these are important factors for
successfully completing a course. Notably, two interviewees named a lack of perseverance as a decisive reason why they had discontinued the online ECG course.
Motivation has also been shown to be an important
factor for students’ performance in online courses .
Whether or to what extent e-learning offerings can
promote the self-efficacy experienced by participants is
establishing
effective learning formats in this field.
The interaction between learners, teachers and learning
contents has been described as a central element in the
learning process . The evaluation of our interviews
suggests this very aspect to be a decisive strength of faceto-face instruction that cannot be replaced one-to-one by
online courses. The opportunity to address the lecturer
directly and obtain an immediate answer was considered
to be a crucial advantage of this format. Also, in the case
of complex topics the exchange with fellow students in
face-to-face courses is experienced as beneficial. The
extent to which these possibilities for interactions are
integrated into online courses is thus a guiding question for the development of e-learning formats. However,
interaction
forums, chats or virtual pinboards do not fully meet this
challenge and as far as possible direct (face-to-face) forms
of communication are needed.
Limitations of our study concern the small sample
size, limiting the generalisability of the results. Even
though similar statements were made by several interviewees, additional interviews with further students
might have contributed to a broader variety of statements. Therefore, the possible range of different assertions was probably not fully exhausted.
The inclusion of students who had discontinued the
online course and then later participated in the face-toface course may have given rise to a potential bias in the
sense of a distortion in favour of face-to-face courses.
However, the analysis of the interviews showed that one
of these students explicitly named the advantages of the
online course and the other could easily have imagined
participating in the online course again. This group also
provided exclusive information based on their experience with both formats. Furthermore, in particular the
very students who discontinue a course may provide
valuable information on reasons for withdrawal.
Pass / fail rates for the examination are not routinely
recorded for the two courses and are therefore not
available to us. None of the interviewees gave any indication that the examination results influenced the choice
of format. This makes a respective bias unlikely.
We are unable to comment on the relative efficacy of
the two formats from the point of view of assessment
performance, as this was not a stated aim of this study.
Conclusions
Despite the limitations mentioned above, our results
indications
aspects could be of particular interest in the future
development of online courses in order to better meet
students’ needs:
Extrinsic motivation – Create both fixed timeframes for
working on topics and external support of self-regulation
Because students’ intrinsic motivation alone does not
prevent them from discontinuing an online course,
external support programmes are also required in order
to maintain self-motivation, effort and perseverance in
equal measure. Therefore, instead of the learning content being available for an indefinite time at any location
we recommend specifying fixed timeframes for working
through topics and integrating face-to-face teaching at
fixed times. As a further tool, automatic exclusion from
the course if a deadline is not met is conceivable as an
external aid for self-regulation if, for example, a corresponding lesson has not been completed by a predetermined time.
Intrinsic motivation – Feedback to students
Individual feedback is crucial for successful completion
of online courses. Feedback from lecturers to students
promotes self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation. One
conceivable option to integrate personal feedback into
an online course would be in the form of submitted and
corrected homework assignments, for example. Learning
controls during or at the end of a learning unit, for
example in the form of embedded multiple-choice questions
previously
increase attention and motivation.
Preference of formats that enable at least some personal
interaction with the lecturer
Building on the previous point, the statements of our
interviewees indicate that face-to-face courses cannot be
replaced one-to-one by online courses as regards the
opportunities for interaction
between lecturers and
students or between students. However, because interaction – especially in the form of feedback – is a
key factor for learning success, we recommend hybrid
forms with a minimum of personal interaction instead of
purely online courses.
Keis et al. BMC Medical Education 17:194
 
The points described above thus mean a shift from
purely online courses to formats that are more strongly
interspersed
face-to-face
(blended learning), at least for difficult or important
subject matters. This proposed change is supported by
the high level of agreement in the additional questionnaire that although e-learning formats are a good
supplement to face-to-face instruction they are not an
adequate replacement for theory-oriented face-to-face
courses when it comes to students’ needs.
To conclude, we believe that the knowledge we
gained from this study is sufficiently valuable to be
consideration
developing
e-learning tools in our faculty.
