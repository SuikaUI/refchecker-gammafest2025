Sampling from the posterior distribution and computing posterior quantities of interest using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples are two
major challenges involved in advanced Bayesian computation. This book
examines each of these issues in detail and focuses heavily on computing various posterior quantities of interest from a given MCMC sample.
Several topics are addressed, including techniques for MCMC sampling,
Monte Carlo (MC) methods for estimation of posterior summaries, improving simulation accuracy, marginal posterior density estimation, estimation
of normalizing constants, constrained parameter problems, Highest Posterior Density (HPD) interval calculations, computation of posterior modes,
and posterior computations for proportional hazards models and Dirichlet
process models. Also extensive discussion is given for computations involving model comparisons, including both nested and nonnested models.
Marginal likelihood methods, ratios of normalizing constants, Bayes factors, the Savage-Dickey density ratio, Stochastic Search Variable Selection
(SSVS), Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), the reverse jump algorithm,
and model adequacy using predictive and latent residual approaches are
also discussed.
The book presents an equal mixture of theory and real applications.
Theoretical and applied problems are given in Exercises at the end of each
chapter. The book is structured so that the methodology and applications
are presented in the main body of each chapter and all rigorous proofs
and derivations are placed in Appendices. This should enable a wide audience of readers to use the book without having to go through the technical
details. Several types of models are used to demonstrate the various compuviii
tational methods. We discuss generalized linear models, generalized linear
mixed models, order restricted models, models for ordinal response data,
semiparametric proportional hazards models, and non parametric models
using the Dirichlet process. Each of these models is demonstrated with real
data. The applications are mainly from the health sciences, including food
science, agriculture, cancer, AIDS, the environment, and education.
The book is intended as a graduate textbook or a reference book for a
one-semester course at the advanced Master's or Ph.D. level. The prerequisites include one course in statistical inference and Bayesian theory at
the level of Casella and Berger and Box and Tiao . Thus, this
book would be most suitable for second- or third-year graduate students in
statistics or biostatistics. It would also serve as a useful reference book for
applied or theoretical researchers as well as practitioners. Moreover, the
book presents several open research problems that could serve as useful
thesis topics.
We would like to acknowledge the following people, who have helped us
in making this book possible. We thank Alan E. Gelfand for sending us
the Table of Contents for his book, Jun S. Liu for his help on Multiple-'fry
Metropolis algorithms, grouped and collapsed Gibbs, grouped move and
multigrid MC sampling, and dynamic weighting algorithms for Chapters
2 and 3, Chuanhai Liu for his help on the CA-adjusted MCMC algorithm, Siddhartha Chib for his suggestions on the Metropolis algorithm,
Metropolized Carlin-Chib algorithm, marginal likelihood estimation, and
other helpful comments, Man-Suk Oh for her extensions to the IWMDE
algorithm, and Linghau Peng and her advisor Edward I. George for sending us the copy of her Ph.D. thesis on normalizing constant estimation for
discrete distribution simulation, Dipak K. Dey for many helpful discussions
and suggestions, Luke Tierney for helpful comments in the early stages of
the book, and Xiao-Li Meng for providing us with several useful papers on
estimation of normalizing constants.
We also thank Colleen Lewis of the Department of Mathematical Sciences
at Worcester Polytechnic Institute for her editorial assistance. Finally, we
owe deep thanks to our families for their constant love, patience, understanding, and support. It is to them that we dedicate this book.
