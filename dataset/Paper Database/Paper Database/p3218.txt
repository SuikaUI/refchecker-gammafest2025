intervention?

Harnessing new digital technologies to support the delivery of health services centred
around the needs of patients has been embraced by the National Health Service (NHS) in
England.1 Digital technologies—eg, apps, wearables, and software algorithms—have the
potential to support a technology-enabled health system in which care interactions are
moved away from formal settings and citizens are encouraged to manage their own health
and illness. The scalability and often low marginal cost of digital interventions suggest they
might deliver cost benefits to stretched services facing the demands of ageing populations
living longer with higher levels of chronic disease. At the same time, a publicly funded
health system has both financial and moral reasons to spend money conscientiously and
judiciously to provide evidence-based effective care for its citizens.2 Some have suggested
that digital medicine is different—that it does not need to be held to the established
standards of evidence-based medicine in the same way that a new drug or device would.3
The traditional comparative processes of evidence-based medicine are slow, some suggest,
and struggle to keep up with the dynamic nature of digital development and delivery.4 This
could stifle innovation, adoption, and growth. Robustness and rigour are seen to be at odds
with rapidity and responsiveness. Others respond that there should be no digital
exceptionalism and that digital tools should be held to the same standards as other healthcare technologies, including drugs and medical devices.5 In this context, the NHS in England
working with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Public Health England,
and Med City, a publicly funded organisation that supports the growth of the life sciences
ecosystem in southeast England, have developed an Evidence Standards Framework for
Digital Health Technologies.6 Launched on Dec 10, 2018, this framework provides standards
for the evidence of effectiveness and economic impact for digital health interventions. The
framework sets the effectiveness and economic standards to help technology companies
develop appropriate evidence generation plans and are complementary to regulatory and
information governance standards. The framework also provides investors and evaluators,
including those commissioning services at local or national level, with a clear and common
understanding of what they should be looking for. We have worked with developers,
clinicians, and academics to create this guidance, and have first released it in a beta form to
allow for changes in response to comments and feedback. The framework is founded on a
proportionate approach to risk, determined by the functionality of the digital tool. A
hierarchical classification identifies the level of evidence appropriate for the intervention.
For example, digital tools that provide diagnosis or treatment are in the highest level for
which the minimum evidence requirement will be a high-quality experimental or quasiexperimental study with comparative data on patient outcomes. Support services and
technologies designed to simply communicate information are lower in the hierarchy and
the requirements are therefore designed around the credibility and accuracy of the content,
including whether they meet established standards for the quality of the information
provided. The framework also proposes some flexibility in what evidence is needed. Within
each categorisation, there are both a minimum and a best practice standard. In some
situations, such as when there is a high risk of death or serious injury if a product does not
work, then the framework requires a move to the best practice standard with more rigorous
evidence requirements. Our approach recognises that there are some things that make
digital health technologies different from more traditional health-care interventions. They
are often rapidly developed and tend to iterate, update, and improve, rather than provide a
stable common intervention. Digital health technologies have the potential to gather and
provide real-time data about use and engagement, and in some cases about outcomes.7
These characteristics mean that it might be possible to generate both research study and
real-world evidence, including data from apps and electronic health records, in a more agile
fashion. The contribution of biomedical engineering and computer science academics to this
area has seen new methodologies being developed, such as Multiphase Optimisation
Strategy (MOST)8 and sequential, multiple assignment, randomised trials (SMART).9 These
present opportunities for us to use faster and more efficient approaches to evidence
generation. However, there should be no lowering of the quality bar and experimental or
quasi-experimental studies using traditional or innovative methodologies need to conform
to high standards, including transparency of methods, a-priori analysis plans, and full
publication of all results. We do not believe digital health technologies to be exceptional. If
money is to be spent on these interventions, they will be competing for the same scarce
resources to fund them as other interventions, so they should be held to the same level of
scrutiny. Beyond effectiveness, there are substantial issues of safety, information
governance, and ethics that have to be considered in the assessment and use of digital
technologies. These standards form part of a wider Code of Conduct for Data Driven
Technologies in England, which sets out principles that industry needs to meet in these
other areas, together with a set of reciprocal commitments that government will make to
facilitate this code.10 Taken together, these new principles and standards are intended to
create an environment that fosters creative innovation and removes barriers to adoption
and uptake, while maintaining appropriate scrutiny and rigour. We hope this clarity will help
digital innovators and healthcare providers to navigate this landscape. Regulators and
health systems around the world are facing similar challenges, and looking to create
proportionate and dynamic solutions. The proposed approach in the Evidence Standards
Framework for Digital Health Technologies6 should have relevance for other jurisdictions
that are also facing the dilemma of how to balance rigour and innovation. These two
attributes need not stand in tension.
