Experiments in many ﬁelds of science and engineering yield data in the form of time series.
The Fourier and wavelet transform-based nonparametric methods are used widely to study the
spectral characteristics of these time series data. Here, we extend the framework of nonparametric
spectral methods to include the estimation of Granger causality spectra for assessing directional
inﬂuences. We illustrate the utility of the proposed methods using synthetic data from network
models consisting of interacting dynamical systems. [Physical Review Letters, in press].

Extracting information ﬂow in networks of coupled dynamical systems from the time series measurements of their
activity is of great interest in physical, biological and social sciences. Such knowledge holds the key to the understanding of phenomena ranging from turbulent ﬂuids to interacting genes and proteins to networks of neural ensembles.
Granger causality has emerged in recent years as a leading statistical technique for accomplishing this goal. The
deﬁnition of Granger causality is based on the theory of linear prediction and its original estimation framework
requires autoregressive (AR) modeling of time series data . Such parametric Granger causality and associated
spectral decompositions have been applied in a wide variety of ﬁelds including condensed matter physics , neuroscience , genetics , climate science , and economics . However, the parametric modeling
methods often encounter diﬃculties such as uncertainty in model parameters and inability to ﬁt data with complex
spectral contents . On the other hand, the Fourier and wavelet transform-based nonparametric spectral methods
are known to be free from such diﬃculties and have been used extensively in the analysis of univariate and
multivariate experimental time series . A weakness of the current nonparametric framework is that it lacks
the ability for estimating Granger causality. In this Letter, we overcome this weakness by proposing a nonparametric
approach to estimate Granger causality directly from Fourier and wavelet transforms of data, eliminating the need
of explicit AR modeling. Time-domain Granger causality can be obtained by integrating the corresponding spectral
representation over frequency . Below, we present the theory and apply it to simulated time series.
Granger causality: the parametric estimation approach. Granger causality is a measure of causal or directional
inﬂuence from one time series to another and is based on linear predictions of time series. Consider two simultaneously recorded time series: X1 : x1(1), x1(2), ..., x1(t), ...; X2 : x2(1), x2(2), ..., x2(t), ... from two stationary stochastic
processes (X1, X2). Now, using AR representations, we construct bivariate linear prediction models for x1(t) and
b11,jx1(t −j) +
b12,jx2(t −j) + ǫ1|2(t)
b21,jx1(t −j) +
b22,jx2(t −j) + ǫ2|1(t)
along with the univariate models: x1(t) = P∞
j=1 αjx1(t −j) + ǫ1(t) and x2(t) = P∞
j=1 βjx2(t −j) + ǫ2(t). Here, ǫ’s
are the prediction errors. If var(ǫ1|2(t)) < var(ǫ1(t)) in some suitable statistical sense, then X2 is said to have a causal
inﬂuence on X1. Similarly, if var(ǫ2|1(t)) < var(ǫ2(t)), then there is a causal inﬂuence from X1 to X2. These causal
inﬂuences are quantiﬁed in time domain by Fj→i = ln var(ǫi(t))
var(ǫi|j(t)), where i = 1, 2 and j = 2, 1.
Experimental processes are often rich in oscillatory content, lending themselves naturally to spectral analysis.
The spectral decomposition of Granger’s time-domain causality was proposed by Geweke in 1982 . To derive the
frequency-domain Granger causality, we start with Eq. (1-2). We rewrite these equations in a matrix form with a lag
operator L: Lx(t) = x(t −1) as
where bij(L) = P∞
k=0 bij,kLk with bij,0 = δij (the Kronecker delta function). The covariance matrix of the noise terms
where Σ11 = var(ǫ1|2), Σ12 = Σ21 = cov(ǫ1|2, ǫ2|1), and Σ22 = var(ǫ2|1). Fourier transforming
Eq. (3) yields
where the components of the coeﬃcient matrix [Bij(f)] are Blm(f) = δlm −P∞
k=1 blm,ke−i2πfk. In terms of transfer
function matrix (H(f) = [Bij(f)]−1), Eq. (4) becomes
Then, the spectral density matrix S(f) is given by
S(f) = H(f)ΣH∗(f),
where ∗denotes matrix adjoint. To examine the causal inﬂuence from X2 to X1, one needs to look at the auto-spectrum
of x1(t)-series, which is S11(f) = H11Σ11H∗
11 + 2Σ12Re(H11H∗
12) + H12Σ22H∗
12. Here, because of the cross-terms in
this expression for S11, the causal power contribution is not obvious. Geweke introduced a transformation that
eliminates the cross terms and makes an intrinsic power term and a causal power term identiﬁable. For X1-process,
this transformation is achieved by left-multiplying Eq. (4) on both sides with
−Σ12/Σ11 1
, which yields:
 B11(f) B12(f)
where ˜B21(f) = B21(f) −Σ12
B11(f), ˜B22(f) = B22(f) −Σ12
B12(f), and ˜E2(f) = E2(f) −Σ12
E1(f). The elements
of the new transfer function ˜H(f) then become ˜H11(f) = H11(f)+ Σ12
H12(f), ˜H12(f) = H12(f), ˜H21(f) = H21(f)+
H11(f), and ˜H22(f) = H22(f). Here, cov(E1, ˜E2) = 0 and the new variance of x2(t) is ˜Σ22 = Σ22 −Σ2
. Now, the
auto-spectrum of x1(t) is decomposed into two obvious parts: S11(f) = ˜H11(f)Σ11 ˜H∗
11(f) + H12(f)˜Σ22H∗
12(f), where
the ﬁrst term accounts for the intrinsic power of x1(t) and the second term for causal power due to the inﬂuence from
X2 to X1. Since Granger causality is the natural logarithm of the ratio of total power to intrinsic power , causality
from X2 to X1 (or, 2 to 1) at frequency f is
I2→1(f) = ln
using the expressions for S11 and ˜Σ22 obtained after the transformation. Next, by taking the transformation matrix
 1 −Σ12/Σ22
and performing the same analysis, one can get Granger causality I1→2(f) from X1 to X2, the
expression for which can be obtained just by exchanging subscripts 1 and 2 in Eq. (8). Geweke showed that the
time-domain measure is theoretically related to the frequency-domain measure as F2→1 ≤1
I2→1(f)df, but for
all processes of practical interest, the equality holds.
From the above discussion, it is clear that the estimation of frequency-domain Granger causality requires noise
covariance and transfer function which are obtained as part of the AR data modeling. The mathematics behind
this parametric approach to obtain these quantities is well-established. However, for nonparametric methods the
current estimation framework does not contain provisions for computing these quantities. Moreover, the parametric
estimation method from ﬁnite data can often produce erroneous results if the series in Eq. (1-2) are not truncated
to proper model orders. There are criteria for choosing proper AR model order, but these criteria cannot always
be satisﬁed. In addition, AR modeling approach does not always capture all the spectral features . To overcome
these diﬃculties, we propose a nonparametric estimation approach, in which we derive, based on Fourier and wavelet
transforms of time series data, noise covariance and transfer function to be used in Geweke’s formulae such as Eq. (8)
for Granger causality estimates.
Granger causality: the nonparametric estimation approach. In the nonparametric approach, spectral density matrices are estimated by using direct Fourier and wavelet transforms of time series data. These matrices then undergo spectral density matrix factorization and Geweke’s variance decomposition for the estimation of
Granger causality. To explain this approach, let us consider a bivariate process with time series x1(t) and x2(t),
their Fourier transforms: X1(f) and X2(f), and wavelet transforms: WX1(t, f) and WX2(t, f). Then, the spectral
matrix S is deﬁned as: S =
, where, in the Fourier-based method, Slm = ⟨Xl(f)Xm(f)∗⟩, and, in
the wavelet method, Slm = ⟨WXl(t, f)WXm(t, f)∗⟩. Here, l = 1, 2, m = 1, 2, and ⟨.⟩is averaging over multiple
realizations. Smoother Fourier-based spectral density with reduced estimation bias can be obtained by using the
multitaper technique , which involves the use of discrete spheroidal sequences (DPSS) . The continuous
wavelet transform WXl(t, s) at time t and scale s is computed by the convolution of time series xl with a scaled and
translated version of a prototype wavelet Ψ(η) that satisﬁes zero-mean and unity square-norm conditions :
WXl(t, s) = 1
xl(η). Using the relationship between s and f for a given prototype wavelet, such
as the Morlet wavelet , one can transform WXl(t, s) into WXl(t, f). The wavelet transform at f = 0 can be obtained by a numerical extrapolation. S(f) or S(t, f) thus formed is a square matrix that can be deﬁned in the interval
[−π, π] and, for all processes of practical interest, satiﬁes the following properties: (i) S(θ) is Hermitian, nonnegative,
and S(−θ) = ST (θ), where θ = 2πf and T denotes matrix transpose, and (ii) S(θ) is integrable and has a Fourier series
expansion: S(θ) = P∞
k=−∞γkeikθ, where the covariance sequence {γk}∞
−∞is formed by γk = (1/2π)
−π S(θ)e−ikθdθ.
According to the factorization theorem , the spectral density matrix S as deﬁned above can be factored 
into a set of unique minimum-phase functions:
∗denotes matrix adjoint, ψ(eiθ) = P∞
k=0 Akeikθ is deﬁned on the unit circle {|z| = 1}, and Ak =
−π ψ(eiθ)e−ikθdθ.
Moreover, ψ can be holomorphically extended to the inner disk {|z| < 1} as
k=0 Akzk where ψ(0) = A0, a real, upper triangular matrix with positive diagonal elements. Similarly
S and H can be deﬁned as functions of z with H(0) = I. Comparing the right hand sides of Eqs (6) and (9) at z = 0
Rewriting Eq. (9) as S = ψA−1
ψ∗and comparing with Eqs (6) and (10), we arrive at the expression for
the transfer function:
Now, by substituting the speciﬁc elements of the noise covariance and transfer function from Eq. (10) and (11) into
Eq. (8), one can estimate pairwise Granger causality spectra. In case of the wavelet, these calculations are repeated
along the time axis for each time point to get the time-frequency representation of Granger causality.
Numerical examples. We consider network models with two autoregressive processes X1 and X2 as nodes where
X1(t) = 0.55X1(t −1) −0.8X1(t −2) + C(t)X2(t −1) + ǫ(t) and X2(t) = 0.55X2(t −1) −0.8X2(t −2) + ξ(t). Here, t
is a time index, ǫ(t) and ξ(t) are independent white noise processes with zero means and unit variances, C(t) is the
coupling strength, and the sampling rate is considered to be 200 Hz. By construction, only X2 has a causal inﬂuence
on X1. First, we ﬁx C(t) at 0.2 ∀t, generate dataset of 5000 realizations (trials), each consisting of 5000 data points,
and apply the Fourier-based nonparametric method. The power spectra of X1 and X2 (Fig. 1(a)) and coherence
spectra between X1 and X2 (Fig.
1 (b)) show 40 Hz peaks.
Figure 1 (c) shows the Granger causality spectra.
Here, both the nonparametric (NP) and parametric (P) approaches yield identical results, recovering correctly the
underlying directional inﬂuences. Since the proper model order is chosen here and the dataset is large, the parametric
causality estimates can be assumed to represent the theoretical values. Next, we let the unidirectional coupling of
X2 to X1 change in its strength C(t) over time as shown in Fig 2(a), generate 5000 realizations, each with 900
time-points. Then, the wavelet spectra are computed for all the trials using the Morlet wavelet (as used in ). The
average wavelet spectra are obtained by averaging over these individual spectra. The average spectra at a time point
is subsequently factored, and H and Σ are obtained and used in Eq. (8) to obtain Granger causality spectra. By
repeating these calculations along time axis, one gets the complete time-frequency maps of Granger causality (Fig.

2(b-c)), which also recovers the correct directional inﬂuences. Granger causality magnitude increases with coupling
Here, the proposed Granger causality techniques are tested on datasets with a large number of long trials. However,
these techniques can also be used reliably with fewer trials. Increasing the number of trials leads to spectral estimates
with smaller variance. A single, suﬃciently long stationary time series can be broken into smaller segments, each of
which can be treated as a distinct trial. The use of multitaper and multiwavelet techniques can yield better
estimates of Granger causality in case of a dataset with shorter length and fewer trials. See Supplementary Material
 for additional numerical examples and applications to brain signals.
Conclusion. Granger causality is a key technique for assessing causal relations and information ﬂow among simultaneous time series. Its traditional parametric estimation framework often suﬀers from uncertainty in model order
selection and inability to fully account for complex spectral features. We develop a nonparametric approach based on
the direct Fourier and wavelet transforms of data that eliminates the need of parametric data modeling and extends
the capability of Fourier and wavelet-based suites of nonparametric spectral tools. It is expected that the integration
of the proposed method into existing laboratory analysis routines will provide the basis for gaining deeper insights
into the organization of dynamical networks arising in many ﬁelds of science and engineering .
