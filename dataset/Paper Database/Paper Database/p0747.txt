Low-Rank Representation (LRR) is arguably one of the most powerful paradigms
for Multi-view spectral clustering, which elegantly encodes the multi-view local graph/manifold structures into an intrinsic low-rank self-expressive data
similarity embedded in high-dimensional space, to yield a better graph partition than their single-view counterparts. In this paper we revisit it with a
fundamentally diﬀerent perspective by discovering LRR as essentially a latent
clustered orthogonal projection based representation winged with an optimized
local graph structure for spectral clustering; each column of the representation
is fundamentally a cluster basis orthogonal to others to indicate its members,
which intuitively projects the view-speciﬁc feature representation to be the one
spanned by all orthogonal basis to characterize the cluster structures. Upon this
ﬁnding, we propose our technique with the followings: (1) We decompose LRR
into latent clustered orthogonal representation via low-rank matrix factorization, to encode the more ﬂexible cluster structures than LRR over primal data
objects; (2) We convert the problem of LRR into that of simultaneously learning orthogonal clustered representation and optimized local graph structure for
each view; (3) The learned orthogonal clustered representations and local graph
structures enjoy the same magnitude for multi-view, so that the ideal multi-view

consensus can be readily achieved. The experiments over multi-view datasets
validate its superiority, especially over recent state-of-the-art LRR models.
Low-Rank Representation, Multi-view Subspace Learning,
Clustering
1. Introduction
Spectral clustering , which partitions the data objects via their local
graph/manifold structure relying on the Laplacian eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition, is one fundamental clustering problem.
Unlike K-Means clustering , the data objects within the same group characterize not only the
large data similarity but also the similar local graph/manifold structure. With
the rapid development of information technology, the data are largely available with the multi-view feature representations (e.g., images can be featured
by a color histogram view or a texture view), which naturally paves the way
to multi-view spectral clustering.
As extensively claimed by the multi-view
research , the information encoded by multi-view features describe
diﬀerent properties; thus leveraging the multi-view information can outperform
the single-view counterparts. One critical issue on a successful multi-view incorporation implied by the existing work , lies in how to achieve
the multi-view consensus/agreement.
Following such principle, a lot of multi-view clustering methods claim
that similar data objects should be within the same group across all views.
Based on that, the consensus multi-view local manifold structure is further
explored with great eﬀorts for multi-view spectral clustering.
Among all these methods, Low-Rank Representation (LRR) coupled with
sparse decomposition based model has been emerged as a substantially elegant
solution, due to its strength of exploring their intrinsic low-dimensional manifold
structure encoded by the data correlations embedded in high-dimensional space,
while exhibiting strong robustness to feature noise corruptions addressed by
sparse noise modeling, hence attracting great attention.
Before proceeding further, some notations that are used throughout the paper are shown below.
1.1. Notations
For Matrix M, the trace of M is denoted as Tr(M); ||M||F =
(or ||·||2 for vector space) denotes the Frobenius norm; ||M||1(P
i,j |Mi,j|) is the
ℓ1 norm, and M T denotes the transpose of M, and its unclear norm as ||M||∗
(sum of all singular values); M(i, ·) and M(·, i) as the ith row and column of M.
M ⪰0 means all entries of M are nonnegative. I is the identity matrix with
adaptive size. 1 indicates the vector of adaptive length with all entries to be 1.
| · | indicates the cardinality of the set.
1.2. Motivation: LRR Revisited for Multi-View Spectral Clustering
Speciﬁcally, the typical LRR model for multi-view spectral clustering stems
from the formulation below:
Z,Ei ||Z||∗+ λ
s.t. Xi = XiZ + Ei,
where Xi ∈Rdi×n is the data representation for the ith view with di as its feature dimension, n as the number of data objects identical for each view, λ is the
balance parameter, and V is the view set. Z ∈Rn×n is the self-expressive lowrank similarity representation shared by all |V | views, constrained with ||Z||∗
based on Xi(i ∈V ) , which can also be substituted by the other speciﬁc dictionaries; ||Ei||1 is modeled to address the noise-corruption for the ith view-speciﬁc
feature representation. Z ⪰0 ensures the nonnegativity for all its entries. Based
on such optimized low-rank Z, the spectral clustering is ﬁnally conducted. One
signiﬁcant limitation of Eq.(1) pointed out by is that, only one common Z
is learned to preserve the ﬂexible local manifold structures for all views, hence
fails to achieve the ideal spectral clustering result. To this end, various low-rank
Zi are learned to preserve the ith view-speciﬁc local manifold structures, meanwhile minimize their divergence via an iterative-views-agreement strategy for
multi-view consensus, followed by a ﬁnal spectral clustering stage. Despite its
encouraging performance, the following standout limitations are inattentively
overlooked for LRR model: (1) The low-rank data similarity may not well encode the ﬂexible latent cluster structures over primal view-speciﬁc feature space;
worse still for the non-ideal local graph construction over such representation for
spectral clustering; (2) The low-rank data similarities coming from multi-views
may not be within the same magnitude, so that the divergence minimization
may not achieve the ideal multi-view clustering consensus.
Our new perspective. The above facts motivate us to revisit the low-rank
representation Zi to help XiZi reconstruct Xi below for the ith view
Zi∈S ||Xi −XiZi||2
where S denotes the set of Zi ∈Rn×n with low-rankness e.g., cluster number
c far less than di; Instead of narrowing Low-Rank Zi as self-expressive
data similarity from the conventional viewpoint, it is essentially seen
as a special case of a generalized Low-Rank projection, to map feature
representation to a low-dimensional space to reconstruct Xi with minimum error. As discussed, the self-expressive similarity projection equipped
with LRR models still suﬀer from the aforementioned non-trivial limitations.
Here we ask a question: Is there a superior low-rank projection
Zi to minimize Eq.(2), meanwhile address the limitations over the
existing LRR models. Our answer to this question is positive. Speciﬁcally,
we propose to consider Zi as a latent clustered orthogonal projection, via Zi =
1. Clustered orthogonal projection: Ui ∈Rn×c, where each column indicates one cluster to characterize its belonging data objects. Compared
with LRR over original feature space, the latent factor Ui can better preserve the ﬂexible latent cluster structure.
2. Feature reconstruction with cluster basis: Instead of low-rank data
similarity, Zi essentially serves as a mapping to reconstruct the view-
speciﬁc features via the column of Ui to encode the latent cluster structures.
3. Rethinking XiZi: We revisit the intuition of XiZi via (XiUi)U T
i throughout two stages, remind that Xi ∈Rdi×n where
 XiUi is performed to obtain the new projection value for all di features over c orthogonal columns of Ui;
is subsequently the projected representation for all di features spanned by c clustered orthogonal column basis of Ui.
4. Same magnitude for multi-view consensus: All Ui(i ∈V ) enjoy the
same magnitude due to their orthonormal columns. Hence, the feasible
divergence minimization will facilitate the multi-view consensus.
Before shedding light on our technique, we review the typical related work for
multi-view spectral clustering
1.3. Prior Arts
The prior arts can be classiﬁed as per the strategy at which the multi-view
fusion takes place for spectral clustering.
The most straightforward method goes to the Early fusion by concatenating the multi-view feature vectors with equal or varied weights into an uniﬁed
one, followed by the spectral clustering over such uniﬁed space. However, such
method ignores the statistical property belonging to an individual view. Late
fusion may address the limitation to some extents by aggregating the spectral clustering result from each individual view, which follows the assumption
that all views are independent to each other. Such assumption is not eﬀective
for multi-view spectral clustering as they assume the views to be dependent
so that the multi-view consensus information can be exploited for promising
performance.
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is applied for multi-view spectral
clustering by learning a common low-dimensional representations for all
views, upon which the spectral clustering is performed. One salient drawback
lies in the failure of preserving the ﬂexible local manifold structures for different views via such common subspace. Co-training based model learned
the Laplacian eigenmap for each view over its projected data representation
throughout the laplacian eigenmaps from other views, such process repeated till
the convergence, the ﬁnal similarity are then aggregated for spectral clustering.
A similar method is also proposed to coordinate multi-view laplacian eigenmaps consensus for spectral clustering. Despite their eﬀectiveness, they have to
follow the scenario of noise free for the feature representations. Unfortunately, it
cannot be met in practice. The Low-Rank Representation and sparse decomposition models well tackle the problem, meanwhile exhibits the robustness
to feature noise corruptions. However, they still suﬀer from the aforementioned
limitations.
To this end, we make the following orthogonal contributions to
typical LRR model for multi-view spectral clustering.
1.4. Our Contributions
 We revisit the classical Low-Rank Representation (LRR) for multi-view
spectral clustering with a fundamentally novel viewpoint of ﬁnding it as
essentially the latent clustered orthogonal projection based representation
with optimized graph structure, to better encode the ﬂexible latent cluster
structures than LRR over primal data objects.
 We convert the problem of learning LRR into that of simultaneously learning the clustered orthogonal representation and its optimized local graph
structure for each view, rather than directly rely on the local graph construction over original data objects.
 The learned multi-view latent clustered representations and local graph
structures enjoy the same magnitude, so as to facilitate a feasible divergence minimization to achieve superior multi-view consensus for spectral
clustering.
Extensive experiments over multi-view datasets validate the superiority of our
2. Learning Clustered Orthogonal projection with Optimized Graph
In this section, we formally discuss our technique. We get started by revisiting the conventional Low-rank representation model by Eq.(1) of yielding a
low-rank Zi, and revisit that from a novel perspective of clustered orthogonal
projection with optimized graph structure.
2.1. Problem Formulation
As previously deﬁned in section 1.2, Xi is the data representation for the
ith view. Zi ∈Rn×n is low-rank data similarity representation for Xi. The
Eq.(2) is equivalent to computing Ui ∈Rn×c such that Zi = UiU T
i , where Ui
has orthonormal columns with its gth column representing the relevance each
data object belongs to the gth cluster, and c indicates latent cluster number.
We then arrive at the following
Ui ||Xi −XiUiU T
As discussed in section 1.2, XiUiU T
reveals the new projection representation
for all di features spanned by the orthogonal basis of Ui to reconstruct Xi.
Optimizing Eq.(3) w.r.t. Ui is equivalent to computing the principle components of Xi to constitute the orthogonal columns of Ui using the principle
eigenvectors. Inspired by this, we exploit the latent cluster structures of Xi to
form non-overlapping clusters with each characterized by one orthogonal column
basis of Ui, which is equivalent to exploit the ||Zi||∗in Eq.(1), under the condition of Zi = UiU T
i . Before that, we revisit one nice property of low-rank matrix
factorization. Thanks to on low-rank matrix factorization formulated as
Ui,Vi,Zi=UiV T
F + ||Vi||2
where Ui ∈Rn×c and Vi ∈Rn×c are latent factors from Zi. Based on that, we
approximate ||Zi||∗via the clustered orthogonal projection factorization Zi =
i , and convert the problem Eq.(1) of minimizing ||Zi||∗to that of learning
clustered projection representation Ui below
Ui,Zi=UiU T
Another issue for spectral clustering is the local data manifold structure
modeling, we discuss that by the following remark.
Remark 1. Unlike the data similarity over raw data objects, Ui via the lowrank matrix factorization can achieve the ﬂexible latent cluster structures. Another crucial issue left to be addressed lies in its local manifold/graph structure
modeling over Ui, which is crucial for spectral clustering. One may directly
refer to the local graph construction over Xi. However, as previously
stated, it cannot eﬀectively encode the local graph structure over Ui.
Towards this end, we propose to learn an optimized local graph structure over
Ui by solving the following
k Wi(j,k)=1,Wi⪰0
||Ui(j, ·) −Ui(k, ·)||2
where Li = Bi −W T
is Laplacian matrix, Bi is the diagonal matrix with
its gth diagonal entry equaled to the sum of the gth row of W T
. The ideal
Wi reveals the probability of jth and kth data points within the same cluster
according to cluster projection representation Ui.
We impose the constraint
that ∀j, Pn
k Wi(j, k) = 1 and Wi(j, ·) ⪰0 to meet the probability nature of Wi.
Following , we will impose the regularization ||Wi||2
F to avoid that only the
nearest neighbor of each data point is assigned 1 with others 0.
With all the above collected, beyond conventional Low-rank Representation
model as Eq.(1), we ﬁnally propose a novel formulation of clustered orthogonal
representation with optimized local graph/manifold structure for multi-view
spectral clustering as Eq.(7)
Ui,Ei,Wi(i∈V )

i = 1, . . . , V,
Xi = DiU T
i + Ei, Di = XiUi
i Ui = I, Gi = Ui, Gi ≥0, ∀j
Wi(j, k) = 1; Wi ⪰0,
where ||Ui||2
F is omitted due to constraint U T
i Ui = I; all the Ui ∈Rn×c(i ∈V )
share the same cluster number c for multi-view clustering consensus. λ1, λ2
and β are non-negative weights related to learning the clustered orthogonal
representation, its local graph structure and multi-view consensus modeling, and
will be studied in Section 5. The constraint U T
i Ui = I ensures the orthonormal
columns of Ui.
Remark 2. We introduce two auxiliary variables Gi = Ui and Di = XiUi ∈
Rdi×c. As will be shown later, the intuition of introducing Di lies in minimizing
||Xi −DiU T
F w.r.t. Di, where
 it is similar as dictionary learning, while popping up U T
as the corresponding sparse representation learning; moreover, it also enjoys the optimization of the isolated U T
i after merging the other Ui into Di.
3. Optimization
Solving Eq.(7) is equivalent to be a uniﬁed process of simultaneously learning
Ui and Wi for the ith(i ∈V ) view. As will be shown later, learning either of them
will promote the other. Optimizing Eq.(7) is not jointly convex to Ui, Wi and Ei,
we hence alternately optimize each of them with the others ﬁxed. Following ,
we deploy the Augmented Lagrange Multiplier (ALM) together with Alternating
Direction Minimization (ADM) strategy, which is widely known as an eﬀective
and eﬃcient solver. As the optimization process for the above variables within
each view is similar, we only present the optimization process for the ith view,
the same process holds for other jth(j ̸= i)views. The augmented lagrangian
function can be written below
k=1 Wi(j,k)=1,0≤Wi(j,k)≤1,UT
i Ui=I L(Ui, Ei, Di, Gi, Wi)
= ||Ei||1 + λ2

+ Φ(µ, ||Xi −DiUi −Ei||2
F + ||Ui −Gi||2
F + ||Di −XiUi||2
1 ∈Rdi×n, Ki
2 ∈Rn×c, and Ki
3 ∈Rdi×c are Lagrange multipliers.
Φ(·, ·) indicates element-wise multiplication. µ > 0 is a penalty parameter.
Solving Ui: We calculate the partial derivative of Eq.(8) w.r.t. Ui,
0 ∈Rn×c, while ﬁxing others to be constant. After rearranging the terms, it
Ui = (λ2Li + (µ + β(|V | −1))I −µXT
With O(n3) computational complexity
1)T −µUiDT
Eﬃcient Row updating strategy of Ui. As shown in Eq.(9), the bottleneck
of updating Ui lies in the high computational complexity of O(n3) caused by
the matrix inverse operation against the Rn×n. To resolve it, we propose to
update each row of Ui. Without loss of generality, we set the derivative w.r.t.
Ui(l, ·), 1 ≤l ≤n to be 0 ∈Rc. It then yields the following
Ui(l, ·) = (T l
Inﬂuences from other views

Ri = ((1 + µ +
(λ2Li(k, l) −µ(XT
i Xi)(k, l)))I ∈Rc×c
i (l, ·)Ki
 Gi(l, ·) −ET
i (l, ·)Di
2(l, ·) −(Ki
1)T (l, ·)Di
Orthonormalize Ui: After obtaining the whole Ui by updating all rows for
each iteration, the clustering algorithm e.g., fast k-means is performed, which
yields the cluster indicator for each data point/each row, leading to orthogonal
columns then normalize each entry of Ui via the rules as: Ui(j, k) =
|Ck| if xj
is assigned with the kth cluster Ck, it is 0 otherwise. According to the processing
above, it successfully achieves the orthonormal columns of Ui (i = 1, . . . , |V |).
Remark 3. As per the row-update strategy for Ui in Eq.(10), we remark the
followings:
1. We dramatically reduces the computational complexity from O(n3) by
Eq.(9) to O(c3), due to c ≪n.
2. Another note goes to the process of multi-view consensus of Ui via the
row update. Speciﬁcally, during each iteration, the Ui(l, ·) is updated via
the inﬂuence from other views, while served as a constraint to guide the
Uj(l, ·)(j ̸= i) updating, among all of which the divergence is decreased
towards a consensus, which is based on the same magnitude among
Ui(i ∈V ) with orthonormal columns.
Solving Di: We get the partial derivative of Eq.(8) w.r.t. Di, then yields the
following closed form:
3 + µ(2Xi −Ei)Ui)(I + U T
The major computational burden lies in (I + U T
i Ui)−1 ∈Rc×c, resulting into
O(c3), which is identical to that for row-updating of Ui, hence eﬃcient.
Solving Ei : Optimizing Eq.(8) w.r.t. Ei is equivalent to solving the following
Ei ||Ei||1 + µ
2 ||Ei −(Xi −DiU T
According to , the following closed form can be obtained
µ (Xi −DiU T
µ (x) = sign(x)max(||x|| −1
µ, 0), sign(x) = 1 if x is positive, it is 0
otherwise.
Solving Gi: Optimizing Eq.(8) w.r.t. Gi is equivalent to the following
2, Ui −Gi) + µ
2 ||Gi −Ui||2
Based on that, we enjoy the following closed form
Gi = Ui + Ki
Solving Wi: The problem of optimizing Wi can be converted to the following
 λ2||Ui(j, ·) −Ui(k, ·)||2
2Wi(j, k) + λ1Wi(j, k)2
Wi(j, k) = 1, 0 ≤Wi(j, k) ≤1
As the similarity vector for each sample is independent, we only study the jth
 λ2||Ui(j, ·) −Ui(k, ·)||2
2Wi(j, k) + λ1Wi(j, k)2
Wi(j, k) = 1, 0 ≤Wi(j, k) ≤1
We convert Eq.(18) to the following
k=1 Wi(j,k)=1,0≤Wi(j,k)≤1 ||Wi(j, ·) + mj
i ∈Rn×1 is a vector, with its kth entry mj
i(k) = λ2||Ui(j,·)−Ui(k,·)||2
leading to the following closed form:
Wi(j, ·) =
where (v)+ turns the negative entries in v to 0 while with positive entries remained. s denotes the number of data points that have nonzero weight connected to the jth sample. We empirically set s = 5 for all views. Once the ∀j
Wi(j, ·) is obtained, we may update that to be a balanced undirected graph as
Consensus Wi(i ∈V ): As Wi is solely determined by Ui according to Eq.(20),
the consensus on Ui(i ∈V ) in Remark 3 naturally leads to the consensus over
Wi(i ∈V ).
Multiplier updating: The lagrange multipliers Ki
3 are automatically updated as
1 + µ(Xi −DiUi −Ei)
2 + µ(Ui −Gi)
3 + µ(Di −XiUi)
Besides, µ is tuned via the adaptive updating rule according to .
Algorithm convergence: It is worth nothing that ADM strategy converges
to a stationary point yet no guaranteed to be global optimum. Upon that, we
deﬁne the convergence when ∀i ∈V, ||Xi−XiUi−Ei||F ≤θ||X||F with θ = 10−6
or maximum iteration number is reached, which is set to be 25 for our method.
The optimization process is conducted regarding each variable alternatively within each view, the entire process is terminated until the
convergence rule is met for all views.
Multi-view clustering output: After the above updating rule is converged,
we got the ﬁnal multi-view clustered representation U = P
i∈V Ui ∈Rn×c; and
multi-view optimized local graph structure W = P
i∈V Wi ∈Rn×n. The normalized graph cut is applied to generate the c clusters as the multi-view spectral
clustering output.
We summarize the whole updating process in Algorithm 1.
4. Computational Complexity Analysis
We clarify its computational feasibility based on Algorithm 1.
view (ith view) within one iteration, the computational complexity for all major
operations is listed below
1. Updating Ui: According to the Remark 3 about Eq. (10), it is O(c3), and
eﬃcient due to c ≪n.
2. Updating Wi: According to Eq.(20), it is O(s) to update each row of
Wi(j, ·), s is the number of data points having positive similarity for jth
data, far less than n. We empirically set s = 5 for the datasets.
3. Updating Di: According to Eq.(12), the major computational complexity
lies in the matrix inverse computation (I +U T
i Ui)−1 ∈Rc×c, resulting into
4. Updating Ei: According to Eq.(14), computational complexity is O(nd).
As observed, the essential operation is to make comparison between each
entry against 1
µ, therefore it is quite eﬃcient in term of implementation.
Suppose the total iteration number is T, leading to the total computational
complexity of our method as O(T(c3 + nd)).
5. Experimental Validation
The following multi-view data sets and their view-speciﬁc features are selected according to .
 UCI handwritten Digit set1: It consists of features of hand-written digits
(0-9). The dataset is described by 6 features and contains 2000 samples
with 200 in each category. Analogous to , we choose 76 Fourier coeﬃcients (FC) of the character shapes and the 216 proﬁle correlations (PC)
as two views.

 Animal with Attribute (AwA)2: It consists of 50 kinds of animals described by 6 features (views): Color histogram (CQ, 2688-dim), local
self-similarity , pyramid HOG (PHOG, 252-dim), SIFT
 , Color SIFT , and SURF . We
randomly sample 80 images for each category and get 4000 images in total.
 NUS-WIDE-Object (NUS) : The data set consists of 30000 images
from 31 categories. We construct 5 views: 65-dimensional color histogram
(CH), 226-dimensional color moments (CM), 145-dimensional color correlation (CORR), 74-dimensional edge estimation (EDH), and 129-dimensional
wavelet texture (WT).
The following typical multi-view baselines are compared for spectral clustering,
covering Early fusion, Late fusion, CCA, Co-training strategy and LRR models
as reviewed in Section 1.3. All the parameters are tuned to their best performance.

Clustering accuracy (ACC) and normalized mutual information (NMI) are
adopted as the evaluation metric for clustering performance. Pleaser refer to
 for their detailed descriptions. They are deﬁned below:
i=1 δ(map(ri), li)
where ri denotes the cluster label of xi, and li denotes the true class label, n is
the total number of images, δ(x, y) is the function that equals one if x = y and
equals zero otherwise, and map(ri) is the permutation mapping function that
maps each cluster label ri to the equivalent label from the database.
j=1 ni,j log ni,j
i=1 ni log ni
j=1 ˆnj log ˆnj
where ni denotes the number of images contained in the cluster Ci (1 ⩽i ⩽c),
ˆnj is the number of images belonging to the class Lj (1 ⩽j ⩽c), and ni,j
denotes the number of images that are in the intersection between cluster Ci
and class Lj. To demonstrate the robustness superiority over non-LRR methods,
following , we set the feature corruption noise for each view is with sparse
noise as 20% entries with uniformly noise over [−5, 5] for RLRR, LRRGL
and our method, with λ1 = 0.8 in Eq.(7) for our method. All experiments are
repeated 10 times, the average clustering results are shown in Tables 1 and 2,
where our method outperforms the others, especially better than RLRR and
LRRGL, due to its strengthes of
 encoding more ﬂexible latent cluster structures, along with the more ideal
optimized local graph structure based on such latent clustered representation.
 The superior multi-view consensus in terms of both latent clustered representation and optimized local graph structure for all views.
To penetrate the ﬁrst ﬁnding, we illustrate the visualized consensus multi-view
aﬃnity matrix over NUS data set between our method and LRRGL in Fig. 1,
2 
which validates the advantages of our clustered orthogonal representation over
low-rank similarity yielded by LRRGL.
To further showcase the superior consensus of our method, we deﬁne the following consensus metric over the multi-view data similarities yielded once the
algorithm converged

implies Eq.(24) to be averaged pair-wise-views similarity divergence.
Wj(k,l); we choose the maximum value to reveal
the magnitude divergence. The results are shown in Table 3, where our method
enjoys a same magnitude for multi-view similarities by the value nearly to be 1
for all data sets.
Parameter Study: We further study the parameter λ2 (clustered orthogonal
representations and optimized local graph structure) and β (multi-view consensus term) in Eq.(7), and against the clustering accuracy (ACC) over AwA
and NUS data sets; the parameter is tuned via grid search against [0.001, 10]
for λ2 and β, we varied one parameter while ﬁxed the others, and the results
are illustrated in Fig. 2, where increasing either of them can improve the clustering accuracy until meet the optimal pair-wise values, followed by a slight
performance decreasing. To balance Figs.2(a) and (b), we ﬁnalize λ2 = 0.7 and
6. Conclusion
In this paper, we revisit the classical Low-Rank Representation (LRR) for
multi-view spectral clustering, by viewing LRR as essentially a latent clustered
orthogonal projection winged with its optimized local graph structure. Following this, we propose to simultaneously learn clustered orthogonal projection and
optimized local graph structure for each view, while enjoy the same magnitude
over them both for all views, leading to a superior multi-view spectral clustering
consensus. The complexity analysis is also delivered to show the computational
feasibility. Extensive experiments validate its strength.

are randomly selected for each of them. The 10 diagonal block represents the data
samples within the 10 ideal clusters, where the whiter the color is, the ideally aﬃnity
value will be. Meanwhile, for non-diagonal blocks, the more black the color is, the
smaller aﬃnity will be to reveal the diﬀerent clusters.
