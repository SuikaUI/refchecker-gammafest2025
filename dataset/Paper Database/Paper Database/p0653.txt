Chest X-ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Due to the high
availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for image recognition and classification. However, due to the limited availability of annotated medical images,
the classification of medical images remains the biggest challenge in medical diagnosis. Thanks to transfer learning, an
effective mechanism that can provide a promising solution by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition tasks
to domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we validate and a deep CNN, called Decompose, Transfer, and Compose (DeTraC),
for the classification of COVID-19 chest X-ray images. DeTraC can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by
investigating its class boundaries using a class decomposition mechanism. The experimental results showed the capability
of DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 cases from a comprehensive image dataset collected from several hospitals around
the world. High accuracy of 93.1% (with a sensitivity of 100%) was achieved by DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19
X-ray images from normal, and severe acute respiratory syndrome cases.

a positive one with COVID-19, and a positive one with the
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
Several classical machine learning approaches have been
previously used for automatic classification of digitised
chest images . For example, in , three statistical
features were calculated from lung texture to discriminate
between malignant and benign lung nodules using a Support
Vector Machine SVM classifier. A grey-level co-occurrence
matrix method was used with Backpropagation Network
 to classify images from being normal or cancerous.
With the availability of enough annotated images, deep
learning approaches have demonstrated their
superiority over the classical machine learning approaches.
CNN architecture is one of the most popular deep learning
approaches with superior achievements in the medical
imaging domain . The primary success of CNN is due
to its ability to learn features automatically from domainspecific images, unlike the classical machine learning
methods. The popular strategy for training CNN architecture
is to transfer learned knowledge from a pre-trained network
that fulfilled one task into a new task . This method
is faster and easy to apply without the need for a huge
annotated dataset for training; therefore many researchers
tend to apply this strategy especially with medical imaging.

Transfer learning can be accomplished with three major
scenarios : a) “shallow tuning”, which adapts only the
last classification layer to cope with the new task, and
freezes the parameters of the remaining layers without
training; b) “deep tuning” which aims to retrain all the
parameters of the pre-trained network from end-to-end
manner; and (c) “fine-tuning” that aims to gradually
train more layers by tuning the learning parameters until
a significant performance boost is achieved. Transfer
knowledge via fine-tuning mechanism showed outstanding
performance in chest X-ray image classification .
Class decomposition has been proposed with the
aim of enhancing low variance classifiers facilitating more
flexibility to their decision boundaries. It aims to the
simplification of the local structure of a dataset in a way
to cope with any irregularities in the data distribution.
Class decomposition has been previously used in various
automatic learning workbooks as a pre-processing step to
improve the performance of different classification models.
In the medical diagnostic domain, class decomposition
has been applied to significantly enhance the classification
performance of models such as Random Forests, Naive
Bayes, C4.5, and SV M .
In this paper, we adapt our previously proposed convolutional neural network architecture based on class decomposition, which we term Decompose, Transfer, and Compose
(DeT raC) model, to improve the performance of pretrained models on the detection of COVID-19 cases from
chest X-ray images.1 This is by adding a class decomposition layer to the pre-trained models. The class decomposition layer aims to partition each class within the image

dataset into several sub-classes and then assign new labels
to the new set, where each subset is treated as an independent class, then those subsets are assembled back to
produce the final predictions. For the classification performance evaluation, we used images of chest X-ray collected from several hospitals and institutions. The dataset
provides complicated computer vision challenging problems due to the intensity inhomogeneity in the images and
irregularities in the data distribution.
The paper is organised as follow. In Section 2, we review
the state-of-the-art methods for COVID-19 detection.
Section 3 discusses the main components of DeTraC and its
adaptation to the detection of COVID-19 cases. Section 4
describes our experiments on several chest X-ray images
collected from different hospitals. In Section 5, we discuss
our findings. Finally, Section 6 concludes the work.
2 Related work
In the last few months, World Health Organization (WHO)
has declared that a new virus called COVID-19 has been
spread aggressively in several countries around the world
 . Diagnosis of COVID-19 is typically associated with
the symptoms of pneumonia, which can be revealed by
genetic and imaging tests. Fast detection of the COVID-19
can be contributed to control the spread of the disease.
Image tests can provide a fast detection of COVID-19,
and consequently contribute to control the spread of the disease. Chest X-ray (CXR) and Computed Tomography (CT)
are the imaging techniques that play an important role in
the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. The historical conception of image diagnostic systems has been comprehensively
explored through several approaches ranging from feature
engineering to feature learning.
A. Abbas et al.
Convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the
most popular and effective approaches in the diagnosis of
COVD-19 from digitised images. Several reviews have been
carried out to highlight recent contributions to COVID-19
detection . For example, in , a CNN was
applied based on Inception network to detect COVID-19
disease within CT. In , a modified version of ResNet-
50 pre-trained network has been provided to classify
CT images into three classes: healthy, COVID-19 and
bacterial pneumonia. CXR were used in by a CNN
constructed based on various ImageNet pre-trained models
to extract the high level features. Those features were
fed into SVM as a machine learning classifier in order
to detect the COVID-19 cases. Moreover, in , a CNN
architecture called COVID-Net based on transfer learning
was applied to classify the CXR images into four classes:
normal, bacterial infection, non-COVID and COVID-19
viral infection. In , a dataset of CXR images from patients
with pneumonia, confirmed COVID-19 disease, and normal
incidents, was used to evaluate the performance of state-ofthe-art convolutional neural network architectures proposed
previously for medical image classification. The study
suggested that transfer learning can extract significant
features related to the COVID-19 disease.
Having reviewed the related work, it is evident that
despite the success of deep learning in the detection of
COVID-19 from CXR and CT images, data irregularities
have not been explored. It is common in medical imaging
in particular that datasets exhibit different types of irregularities (e.g. overlapping classes) that affect the resulting
accuracy of machine learning models. Thus, this work
focuses on dealing with data irregularities, as presented in
the following section.
3 DeTraC method
This section describes in sufficient details the proposed
method for detecting COVID-19 from CXR images. Starting
with an overview of the architecture through to the different
components of the method, the section discusses the
workflow and formalises the method.
3.1 DeTraC architecture overview
DeTraC model consists of three phases. In the first phase,
we train the backbone pre-trained CNN model of DeTraC
to extract deep local features from each image. Then we
apply the class-decomposition layer of DeTraC to simplify
the local structure of the data distribution. In the second
phase, the training is accomplished using a sophisticated
gradient descent optimisation method. Finally, we use a
class composition layer to refine the final classification of
the images. As illustrated in Fig. 2, class decomposition
and composition components are added respectively before
and after knowledge transformation from an ImageNet pretrained CNN model. The class decomposition layer aiming
at partitioning each class within the image dataset into k
sub-classes, where each subclass is treated independently.
Then those sub-classes are assembled back using the classcomposition component to produce the final classification
of the original image dataset.
3.2 Deep feature extraction
A shallow-tuning mode was used during the adaptation and
training of an ImageNet pre-trained CNN model using the
collected CXR image dataset. We used the off-the-shelf
CNN features of pre-trained models on ImageNet (where
the training is accomplished only on the final classification layer) to construct the image feature space. However, due to the high dimensionality associated with the
images, we applied PCA to project the high-dimension
feature space into a lower-dimension, where highly correlated features were ignored. This step is important for
the class decomposition to produce more homogeneous
classes, reduce the memory requirements, and improve the
efficiency of the framework.
3.3 Class decomposition layer
Now assume that our feature space (PCA’s output) is
represented by a 2-D matrix (denoted as dataset A), and L
is a class category. A and L can be rewritten as
a11 a11 . . .
a21 a22 . . .
an1 an2 . . .
⎥⎥⎥⎦, L = {l1, l2, . . . , lk} ,
where n is the number of images, m is the number of features, and k is the number of classes. For class decomposition, we used k-means clustering to further divide each
class into homogeneous sub-classes (or clusters), where
each pattern in the original class L is assigned to a class
label associated with the nearest centroid based on the
squared euclidean distance (SED):
where centroids are denoted as cj.
Once the clustering is accomplished, each class in L will
further divided into k subclasses, resulting in a new dataset
(denoted as dataset B).

Fig. 2 Decompose, Transfer, and Compose (DeTraC) model for the detection of COVID-19 from CXR images
Accordingly, the relationship between dataset A and B
can be mathematically described as:
A = (A|L) →B = (B|C)
where the number of instances in A is equal to B while
C encodes the new labels of the subclasses (e.g. C =
{l11, l12, . . . , l1k, l21, l22, . . . , l2k, . . . lck}). Consequently A
and B can be rewritten as:
a11 a11 . . .
a21 a22 . . .
an1 an2 . . .
b11 b11 . . .
b21 b22 . . .
bn1 bn2 . . .
3.4 Transfer learning
With the high availability of large-scale annotated image
datasets, the chance for the different classes to be
well-represented is high. Therefore, the learned in-between
class-boundaries are most likely to be generic enough to
new samples. On the other hand, with the limited availability
of annotated medical image data, especially when some
classes are suffering more compared to others in terms of
the size and representation, the generalisation error might
increase. This is because there might be a miscalibration
between the minority and majority classes. Large-scale
annotated image datasets (such as ImageNet) provide
effective solutions to such a challenge via transfer learning
where tens of millions parameters (of CNN architectures)
are required to be trained.
For transfer learning, we used, tested, and compared
several ImageNet pre-trained models in both shallow- and
deep- tuning modes, as will be investigated in the experimental study section. With the limited availability of training data, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can heavily
be fluctuating the objective/loss function and hence overfitting can occur. To improve convergence and overcome overfitting, the mini-batch (MB) of stochastic gradient descent
(mSGD) was used to minimise the objective function, E(·),
with cross-entropy loss
A. Abbas et al.
where xj is the set of input images in the training, yj is the
ground truth labels while z(·) is the predicted output from a
softmax function.
3.5 Evaluation and composition
In the class decomposition layer of DeTraC, we divide
each class within the image dataset into several sub-classes,
where each subclass is treated as a new independent class.
In the composition phase, those sub-classes are assembled
back to produce the final prediction based on the original
image dataset. For performance evaluation, we adopted
Accuracy (ACC), Specificity (SP) and Sensitivity (SN)
metrics. They are defined as:
Accuracy(ACC) = T P + T N
Sensitivity (SN) =
T P + FN ,
Specificity (SP ) =
T N + FP ,
where T P is the true positive in case of COVID-19 case and
T N is the true negative in case of normal or other disease,
while FP and FN are the incorrect model predictions for
COVID-19 and other cases.
More precisely, in this work we are coping with a multiclassification problem. Consequently, our model has been
evaluated using a multi-class confusion matrix of .
Before error correction, the input image can be classified
into one of (c) non-overlapping classes. As a consequence,
the confusion matrix would be a (Nc ×Nc) matrix, and T P ,
T N, FP and FN for a specific class i are defined as:
xjk, j ̸= i, k ̸= i
xji, j ̸= i
xij, j ̸= i,
where xii is an element in the diagonal of the matrix.
3.6 Procedural steps of DeTraC model
Having discussed the mathematical formulations of DeTraC
model, in the following, the procedural steps of DeTraC
model is shown and summarised in Algorithm 1.
DeTraC establishes the effectiveness of class decomposition in detecting COVID-19 from CXR images. The main
contribution of DeTraC is its ability to deal with data irregularities, which is one of the most challenging problems in
the detection of COVID-19 cases. The class decomposition
layer of DeTraC can simplify the local structure of a dataset
with a class imbalance. This is achieved by investigating the
class boundaries of the dataset and adapt the transfer learning accordingly. In the following section, we experimentally
validate DeTraC with real CXR images for the detection of
COVID-19 cases from normal and SARS cases.

This section presents the dataset used in evaluating the
proposed method, and discusses the experimental results.

4.1 Dataset
In this work we used a combination of two datasets:
80 samples of normal CXR images (with 4020 ×
4892 pixels) from the Japanese Society of Radiological
Technology (JSRT) .
CXR images of , which contains 105 and 11 samples
of COVID-19 and SARS (with 4248 × 3480 pixels).
4.2 Parameter settings
All the experiments in our work have been carried out in
MATLAB 2019a on a PC with the following configuration:
3.70 GHz Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6100 Duo, NVIDIA
Corporation with the donation of the Quadra P5000GPU,
and 8.00 GB RAM.
We applied different data augmentation techniques to
generate more samples including flipping up/down and
right/left, translation and rotation using random five different angles. This process resulted in a total of 1764 samples.
Also, a histogram modification technique was applied to
enhance the contrast of each image. The dataset was then
divided into two groups: 70% for training the model and
30% for evaluation of the classification performance.
For the class decomposition layer, we used AlexNet
 pre-trained network based on shallow learning mode
to extract discriminative features of the three original
classes. AlexNet is composed of 5 convolutional layers to
represent learned features, 3 fully connected layers for the
classification task. AlexNet uses 3 × 3 max-pooling layers
with ReLU activation functions and three different kernel
filters. We adopted the last fully connected layer into three
classes and initialised the weight parameters for our specific
classification task. For the class decomposition process, we
used k-means clustering . In this step, as pointed out
in , we selected k = 2 and hence each class in L is
further divided into two clusters (or subclasses), resulting
in a new dataset (denoted as dataset B) with six classes
(norm 1, norm 2, COVID-19 1,COVID-19 2, SARS 1, and
SARS 2), see Table 1.
In the transfer learning stage of DeTraC, we used
different ImageNet pre-trained CNN networks such as
AlexNet , VGG19 , ResNet , GoogleNet ,
and SqueezeNet . The parameter settings for each pretrained model during the training process are reported in
4.3 Validation and comparisons
To demonstrate the robustness of DeTraC, we used different
ImageNet pre-trained CNN models (such as AlexNet,
VGG19, ResNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet) for the
transfer learning stage in DeTraC. For a fair comparison,
we also compared the performance of the different
versions of DeTraC directly with the pre-trained models
in both shallow- and deep- tuning modes. The results are
summarised in Table 3, confirming the robustness and
effectiveness of the class decomposition layer when used
with pre-trained ImageNet CNN models.
As shown by Fig. 3, DeTraC with VGG19 has achieved
the highest accuracy of 97.35%, sensitivity of 98.23%, and
specificity of 96.34%. Moreover, Fig 3 shows the learning
curve accuracy and loss between training and test obtained
by DeTraC. Also, the Area Under the receiver Curve (AUC)
was produced as shown in Fig 4.

experiments is conducted to show the effectiveness of
DeTraC on detecting original Covid-19 cases (i.e. after
removing the augmented test images). Table 4 demonstrates
the classification performance of all the models, used in
this work, on the original test cases. As illustrated by
Table 4, DeTraC outperformed all pre-trained models with
a large margin in most cases. Note that the only case

This explains the notable accuracy boost when applying
DeTraC on the deep-tuned VGG19 architecture (+25.36%).
5 Discussion
Training CNNs can be accomplished using two different
strategies. They can be used as an end-to-end network,
where an enormous number of annotated images must
be provided (which is impractical in medical imaging).
Alternatively, transfer learning usually provides an effective
solution with the limited availability of annotated images
by transferring knowledge from pre-trained CNNs (that
have been learned from a bench-marked large-scale image
dataset) to the specific medical imaging task. Transfer
learning can be further accomplished by three main
scenarios: shallow-tuning, fine-tuning, or deep-tuning.
However, data irregularities, especially in medical imaging
applications, remain a challenging problem that usually
results in miscalibration between the different classes in the
dataset. CNNs can provide an effective and robust solution
for the detection of the COVID-19 cases from CXR images
and this can be contributed to control the spread of the
Here, we adapted and validated a deep convolutional
neural network, called DeTraC, to deal with irregularities in
a COVID-19 dataset by exploiting the advantages of class
decomposition within the CNNs for image classification.
DeTraC is a generic transfer learning model that aims
to transfer knowledge from a generic large-scale image
recognition task to a domain-specific task. In this work, we
validated DeTraC with a COVID-19 dataset with imbalance
classes (including 105 COVID-19, 80 normal, and 11 SARS
cases). DeTraC has achieved high accuracy of 98.23%
with VGG19 pre-trained ImageNet CNN model, confirming
its effectiveness on real CXR images. To demonstrate the
robustness and the contribution of the class decomposition
layer of DeTraC during the knowledge transformation using
transfer learning, we also used different pre-trained CNN
models such as ALexNet, VGG, ResNet, GoogleNet, and
SqueezeNet. Experimental results showed high accuracy in
dealing with the COVID-19 cases used in this work with
all the pre-trained models trained in a deep-tuning mode.

augmented test cases, obtained by DeTraC model when compared to

cases only, obtained by DeTraC model when compared to different
pre-trained models, in shallow- and deep-tuning modes
More importantly, significant improvements have been
demonstrated by DeTraC when compared to the pre-trained
models without the class decomposition layer. Finally, this
work suggests that the class decomposition layer with a
pre-trained ImageNet CNN model (trained in a deep-tuning
mode) is essential for transfer learning, see Figs. 5 and
6, especially when data irregularities are presented in the
6 Conclusion and future work
Diagnosis of COVID-19 is typically associated with the
symptoms of pneumonia, which can be revealed by genetic
and imaging tests. Imagine test can provide a fast detection
of the COVID-19 and consequently contribute to control
the spread of the disease. CXR and CT are the imaging
techniques that play an important role in the diagnosis of
COVID-19 disease. Paramount progress has been made in
deep CNNs for medical image classification, due to the
availability of large-scale annotated image datasets. CNNs
enable learning highly representative and hierarchical local
image features directly from data. However, the irregularities in annotated data remains the biggest challenge in
coping with real COVID-19 cases from CXR images.
In this paper, we adapted DeTraC, a deep CNN architecture, that relies on a class decomposition approach for
the classification of COVID-19 images in a comprehensive
dataset of CXR images. DeTraC showed effective and robust
solutions for the classification of COVID-19 cases and its
ability to cope with data irregularity and the limited number
of training images too. We validated DeTraC with different
pre-trained CNN models, where the highest accuracy has
been obtained by VGG19 in DeTraC. With the continuous
collection of data, we aim in the future to extend the experimental work validating the method with larger datasets. We
also aim to add an explainability component to enhance the
usability of the model. Finally, to increase the efficiency and
allow deployment on handheld devices, model pruning, and
quantisation will be utilised.
