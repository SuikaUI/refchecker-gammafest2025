ABSTRACT… Objectives: To assess the readiness for eLearning in dental institutes of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa. Study Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Three dental institutes affiliated
with three different universities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province. Period: October 2016
to January 2017. Methods: Participants were all the dental students (n=789), postgraduate
trainees (n=167) and faculty members (n=103) of these institutes. Data were collected using
pre-validated ‘Students’ E-Learning Readiness Scale’ and interpreted through descriptive and
non-parametric statistics. Results: The response rate was 54% (568/1059). The respondents
were predominantly female (62.3%), however, most of the faculty members were male. The
mean scores for the undergraduates, postgraduates and the faculty across all the subscales
(technology access, online skills and relationship, motivation, online audio/video preferences,
readiness for online discussions and the importance of e-learning to participants’ success)
were above 3, indicating good readiness. The agreement was relatively lower in the subscales
on motivation and online discussions. The mean scores of the faculty were higher than the
undergraduate and postgraduate students. A comparison among genders also showed
significantly higher readiness for eLearning among males than the female. Both the public
and private institutes have access to technology and internet facilities. Conclusion: The
undergraduate, postgraduate students and faculty from the public and private-sector institutes
of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province have good readiness for eLearning. The female students
need further training in effective use of computer and internet for educational purpose. Course
designers should focus on improving learners’ motivation and online interaction. Future
research should compare our findings with institutions in other provinces of Pakistan.

INTRODUCTION
The trends in medical education are rapidly
evolving with more student-centred learning
approaches.1 Students are encouraged to take
on the driving seat with active construction of
knowledge.2 The adults learners are self-directed
and they resist information being imposed.3
They want to be respected and encouraged
towards expression of ideas. Responding to
these growing changes in higher education and
other global economic constraints, e-learning
is increasingly being used for a broad range of
professional training and educational initiatives
in healthcare around the world.4 Globally, various
undergraduate and postgraduate professional
training programs run via eLearning5 and virtual
medical schools have also been established.6
electronic
communication technologies to deliver text, audio,
image, animation, and video in education.7 The
curriculum organizers encourage online learning
and discussion through several resources such
as learning management systems (LMS), virtual
classrooms, email, Web 2.0 (mainly Wikipedia,
Facebook). eLearning is known to reduce the longterm costs associated with delivering educational
content, facilitate the development and scalability
of educational interventions and improve access
to education.4 In medical education, e-learning
provides a solution for continuously updating and
expanding curriculum. It overcomes the shortage
of faculty and enables them to deliver content
and reach students anywhere at any time inside

and outside classroom.
For rapidly developing countries, the use
of e-learning resources across the medical
education continuum for students and faculty
seems a possibility.8 However, the demographics
and resources vary and even though eLearning
is a success for other countries it may not
be the same for Pakistan. According to our
literature review, no studies have assessed
the needs, abilities and resources required
for implementation of eLearning in Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan. Such a study is
important to uncover the factors that are critical
to successful implementation of well-organized
eLearning structure and tools.9 The Pakistan
Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) is also in the
process of revamping policies for undergraduate,
postgraduate and continuing medical education.
Therefore, this study is timely and particularly
useful to inform policy and practice for universities
and colleges. We assessed the readiness for
e-learning among dental students, trainees and
faculty members of dental institutes from Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa province as a part of learner
analysis in instructional design.
This descriptive cross-sectional survey was
carried out in three dental institutes of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province from October 2016
to January 2017. Each of these dental institutes
are affiliated with three different universities
of KP i.e. Khyber Medical University (public),
Gandhara University (private) and RIPHAH
International University (private) respectively.
The institutes have been approved by Pakistan
Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) and College
of Physician and Surgeons (CPSP), Pakistan for
undergraduate and postgraduate trainings.
Questionnaire
Several instruments have been developed
for assessing learners’ capabilities, attitudes,
accessibility
eLearning.10,11,12,13 In this study, we used ‘Students’
E-Learning Readiness Scale’ developed by
Watkins et al as its validity and reliability has
established.10
instrument
explores the ease of access, necessary technical
skills, issue related to learners’ attitudes and
beliefs in great detail, which is important to the
successful implementation of eLearning.14,15 The
instrument was revalidated in the local context
by four experts. It was then piloted (n=12)
to ensure understanding by the participants,
identifying ambiguities and difficult questions.
No changes were suggested. The questionnaire
includes 27 items that assess participants on
six subscales: technology access, online skills
and relationship, motivation, online audio/video
preferences, readiness for online discussions
and the importance of e-learning to participants’
success.10 A five-point scale (1: strongly disagree
through to 5: strongly agree) was used to ask
participants to rate their readiness for e-learning.
Demographic questions were added to the
questionnaire and it was kept anonymous.
Data Collection
Ethical approval was obtained from one of the
institutes, which was accepted by the other two
institutes. Participants were all the dental students
(n=789), postgraduate trainees (n=167) and
faculty members (n=103) of these institutes in
2016. They were informed about the purpose
of this research and its implication towards
introduction of online dental education resources
in KP. Participation was voluntary, and participants
expressed their consent by completing and
returning the questionnaire.
Data Analysis
Each completed questionnaire was given a unique
ID. All the data from the questionnaire were coded
and entered into SPSS.v.24. Descriptive statistics
(frequencies and averages) were calculated.
The average of each subscale was calculated by
dividing the sum of averages of all the items by the
number of items in each subscale. Averages more
than 3 indicate good readiness, and scores equal
or less than 3 shows inappropriate readiness of
the participants in that subscale. Several factors
including: gender, academic achievement, brain
processing and culture can influence learners

compared respondent subgroups. The data

p=0.000) therefore non-parametric tests such
as Mann–Whitney U, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test
and Kruskal–Wallis were used. P value less than
0.05 was considered as significant.
The response rate was 54% (568/1059). The
respondents were predominantly female (62.3%),
however, most of the faculty members were male.
The respondents had a good amalgamation
of X, Y and Z generation. The undergraduates
were mainly from Generation Z, who grew up
in a highly sophisticated media and computer
environment. The postgraduate trainees belonged
to Generation Y, while the faculty members had a
good mix of both Generation X and Y. One fourth of
the students and trainees were hostelites. Among
our respondents, the public-sector institute had
more postgraduate trainees and faculty members
than the two private institutes combined. (Table-I)

significantly different (p=0.000) perceptions
on all sub-scales, except for their online audio/
video preferences and importance of eLearning
sub-scales (p=0.166), which showed a similar
perception. In general, the respondents rated
their access to technology and online skills higher
than their levels of motivation and readiness
for online discussions, which were less than
all other subscales. The mean scores for the
undergraduates, postgraduates and the faculty
were above 3 across all the subscales. However,
these scores were comparatively lower in the
subscales on motivation and readiness for online
discussions. The mean scores of the faculty were
higher than the undergraduate and postgraduate
students. However, these differences were only
significant for the subscales on online skills and
importance of e-learning. A comparison among
genders showed significantly higher readiness
for eLearning on all the subscales such as in
having online skills and motivation among males
than the female respondents, except in having
access to technology (computer, internet and
softwares). The mean scores of hostelites on
most of the subscales were higher than the day
scholars, however, these differences were nonsignificant. Readiness for online discussions was
significantly higher among respondents from
private institutes than the government funded
(public) institute. The differences in mean score
on all other sub-scales among public and private
institutions were non-significant.

DISCUSSION
The current study assessed the readiness for
eLearning among dental students, trainees and
faculty from three dental institutes of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa province. The scores for the
undergraduates, postgraduates and the faculty
indicated good readiness (mean score above
3) of the participants on all the subscales. The
respondents had high agreement on having
access to technology, internet and possession
of necessary computer skills. These findings
are in line with those reported by Asiry (Saudi
Arabia),9 Suri and Sharma (India)17, Goodwin
et al (Kuwait)18 and Eslaminejad et al (Iran).19
The agreement on ‘motivation’ and ‘readiness
for online discussion’ subscales were less than
other subscales, as also reported by similar
study on postgraduate students from Iran.5 As
the instructor is not present at all times in online
courses, the learners’ motivation and catching up
on different discussion boards simultaneously is
an issue. Motivation of the learners and interactive
discussions are important for efficient online
learning resulting in high retention and better
outcomes.20,21 To improve motivation and maintain
it during an online course, the course designers
should relate course objectives with the learners’
practice as processing relevant information
allows for deeper learning14 and encourage
active participatory learning. On the other hand,
lack of readiness for online discussions may
be related to inexperience and novelty of virtual
learning environment (VLE). Therefore, adding
preparatory activities to the course, including
techniques for establishing and managing VLE
and online discussions is recommended.14
We found that faculty is more motivated
towards e-learning than the undergraduate and
postgraduate students, this may be because
currently faculty have more usage of technology
and internet on day-to-day basis for lecturing and
research purposes. It may also be related to their
thirst for learning new instructional designs that
can help them match the evolving requirements
of teaching. Such an optimistic stance of faculty
members towards e-learning is encouraging, as it
will not only be important for their own learning but
also for the provision of online learning content,
facilitation of learning process and building fruitful
interaction with their students.19
Gender related differences have been found
in many other studies from Pakistan.22,23 The
underlying reason may be related to region specific
socio-cultural traditions and deep-rooted gender
inequalities.24 In this study, male respondents
showed significantly higher readiness than the
female respondents on other subscales including
motivation, online audio/video preferences and
online skills and relationship. Arenas-Gaitán et
al25, Lu and Chiou,26 Wei and Johnes27 and Ong
and Lai28 also found that males prefer and value
using e-learning platforms more than females.
We recommend proactive measures for capacity
building, skill development and training to
neutralize these gender differences.
Online discussion forum provides a platform for
open exchange of views, keeps an evidence
of thoughts and communications, and also
offers observation for everyone29. Readiness
for online discussion was found significantly
less in government funded (public) institute
as compared to private. Although, this might
be perceived that it is due to lack of access to
technology and internet facilities in public-sector
institutions, however, this was not the case in this
study. Hence, this needs further exploration using
qualitative methods.
In the current study, an overriding percentage
of respondents indicated strong willingness and
acceptance towards all the potential benefits
of eLearning. Therefore, eLearning seems a
possibility in future professional development
and education of dental students and faculty.
Jawaid and Ashraf in their study exposed first
year medical students to an e-learning module for
six months at Dow University of Health Sciences,
Karachi.30 They reported good experience
of students, who wanted more topics to be
covered with this modality. Similar response was
observed in the students from Lahore Medical
and Dental College.31 We recommend integration
of e-learning into undergraduate, graduate, and
continuing medical education. As eLearning is
relatively new in Pakistan, therefore, initially it

may be used in combination with traditional faceto-face teaching (blended learning).
Our findings are not generalizable but relevant
only to the institutes of KP, yet its potential value is
that it helped in identifying readiness in the most
developed institutes affiliated with three different
universities of the country. The self-reported
nature of findings is another concern. Despite
these limitations, the findings help understand
the potential challenges towards implementation
of online learning for undergraduate, graduate,
and continuing medical education in Pakistan.
CONCLUSION
undergraduate,
postgraduate
and faculty from the public and private-sector
institutes of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province have
good readiness for eLearning. eLearning across
the medical education continuum for students
and the faculty seems a possibility. The female
students need some motivation and training.
Both the public and private institutes have access
to technology and internet facilities. The female
students need further training in effective use of
computer and internet for educational purpose.
Course designers should ensure adequate
measures for improving learners’ motivation and
interaction. Future research should compare our
findings with institutions in other provinces of
