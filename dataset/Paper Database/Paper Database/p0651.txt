I. The iVat~re o~ Probabilit//.
q '~HE theory of probability suffers at the present time from
the existence of several different points of view, whose
relations to one "mother have apparently never been adequately
discussed. On the one hand some authorities follow de Morgan
and Jevons in regarding probability as a concept compre-
hensible without any definition, and perhaps indefinable,
satisfying cert:Sn definite laws the logical basis of which is
no~ yet clear.
On the other hand, attempts have been nmde
to give definitions of probability in terms of frequency of
occurrence; of these one is due to Laplace, who was largely
followed by Bool% and another to Venn.
Frequency of
occurrence being ~. well-understood mathenmtical concept r
such a definition would be important if it could be carried
ou~; for then the undefined notion of probability would be
expressed in terms of others that are better understood, and
its laws, if true, would become demonstrable theorems in
pure mathematics instead of postulates.
Thus the subject
would acquire the certainty of any other portion of pure
mathematics and it would be unnecessary to investigate its
foundations independently.
It appears, however, as we hope
to show in the first part of the present paper, that the
definitions offered either implicity involve the very notion
they are meant to avoid, or else make assumptions which are
actually erroneous.
We therefore consider it best to regard
prob,bility as a primitive notion not requiring definition.
Laplace defines probability t as the ratio of the number of
favourable eases to that of all possible oases, and then goes
on to say "but that supposes the various cases equally
possible," so that to understand this definition it is necessary
to examine what Laplace meant by equally possible.
expression is meaningless as it stands, for a proposition
relative to a set of data is always either possible or im-
possible; there can be no degrees of possibility.

In fact it seems that by equally possible he meant
equall?! probable.
Thus, as Poincar6 has pointed out, it seems
Useless to attempt to make this definition satisfactory; it
defines the probability of one proposition in terins of those
of a set of others and not in terms of frequency alone, so that
the notion Laplace set out to define reappears in the un-
defined concept of e~uallypossible.
The statement is, in fact,
not a definition, but a simple and important principle ,of,
probability inference.
:Nor does it appear that there is any
prospoc~ of making any modification of it into a definition of
probability ; for .~here will always be the difticulty of deciding
what are to be considered as unit alternatives.
It is clea,"
th'~t even if it were possible to avoid introducing the notion
of equally probable alternatives, some other way of dis-
tinguishing between sets of' mutually exclusive and exhaustive
alternatives would have to be found, and the immense variety
of the circumstances to which it would have to apply seems
to indicate that its scope must be at least as wide as that of
truth ; and it is very unlikely that a lmtion so general is
capable of definition.
The view of Venn* is much more complex.
He considers
that the notion presupposes a series, the terms of which are
indefinitely numerous and represent the cases of an attribute
From these one can pick out a smaller class, the members
of which possess the further attribute ~.
If, then, we have
chosen n members in all and m o[ tilem belong to the smaller
class, the probability of ~ given (h is defined as the limit
of ,~/n when n becomes indefinitely great.
The form of this
definition restricts the field of probability very seriously.
In the first place it seems impossible to apply it to any case
where the number of members of the first series is finite;
one could attach no meaning to a statement that it is probable
that the solar system was formed by the disruptive approach
of a stair larger than the sun, or that it is improbable that
die stellar universe is symmetrical, for the indefinite repetition
of entities of such large dimensions is utterly fantastic.
such cases as these are the very ones where the notion of
probability is particularly valuable in science, and any
definition that will not cover them is not satisfactory.
It may be urged, however, that this theory gives an
adequate treatment of probability as applied to the class of
cases with which it deals.
Serious difficulties nevertheless
present themselves.
The existence of a probability on this
theory requires that a limit shall exist to which a certain
ratio tends in the long run ; and one is led to ask what the
* ' Logic of Chance,' 1)p. 162 et seq~.

evidence is for the existence of such a limit.
Suppose, for
instance, that the probability of 5k given ~ is ~.
numbers of both ~'s and not-~'s are infinite, and selections
of ~b's may therefore be made so that the ratio of ~'s to all
~b's will tend to any limit whatever between 0 and 1; it may
even tend to no limit at all.
If, for instance, every time a
occurs we write 1, and every time a not-~ occurs we write
O, m/n will be the mean of the first n terms of the series thus

where the number of digits in any block of similar digits
after the first is equal to the total number of digits tha~

starting at the (2~'-~+_ 1)th figure.

The r-th block consists of 2 ~-~ zeros, and at the end of it
m[n has fallen to ,~(,1+2 ("-*)).
In the next block it rises
again to }(2 + 2 -(':- )).
~hus, however great r may be, we
can find values of n greater than 2 "-"~ such that m/n is greater
than w and others such that m/n is less than ~ +e, however
small e may be.
Thus m/n tends to no limit whatever.
notion that all series picked from the class of entities with
the property qb will give series of values of m/n tending to
the same limit is therefore incorrect, unless some further
criterion be introduced to exclude all those that do not behave
in this way, whose number is infinite ; and the task will not
be an easy one, for any criterion based on the mode of
occurrence of long runs of ~b's or not-hb's is liable to be
found invalid in instances occurring in practice.
The origin of the idea that such a limit must exist may be
considered at this stage, as it involves ~ theoretical point that
may be of importance in future developments of the subject.
The belief was based on a well-known theorem of James
Bernoulli, a proof of which, based on 8tirling's approximation
to n! for large values of n, is given by Laplace*.

These two proposi~ions bear a elo~e resemblance, to each
other, but they are not equivalent.
In fact, in consequence
Of the existence of modes of selection for which m/n does not
tend to r as a limit, we know that the second proposition
mus~ be false.
The first, on the other hand, has just been
proved true; but it does not even establish a high probability
for the proposition that m/n tends to r as a limit in any
p.trtieular case.
For it has been shown only that a certain
result will have a very high probability when a single value
of e has been assigned ; but there is no reason to infer from
this that the probability is high that it will hold for all values
of e whaf, ever, which would have to be true if m/n were to
tend to a limit.
The difticu]ty is somewhat similar to that in
the theory of infinite series, with regard to series that "con-
verge with infinite slowness."
II. TtLe Mathe~atieal Theory of Probability.
An essential assumption in order that analytical methods
may be applicable to the theory of probabiliLy must now be
stated, namely, that a correspondence can be established
between positive real numbers and the propositions to which
the fundamengal notion of probability is applicable (relative
in each ease to the appropriate data) which shall have the
following properties.
Miss Wrinch and Dr. t~. Jeffreys on some
1. To each combination o[ proposition and data corresponds
one and only one number.
2. 1[ in one combiua~ion the proposition is more probable
relative to the data than in another, the number
corresponding to the first is greater than that corre-
sponding to the second.
3. If two propositions re[erred to the same data are
mutually exclusive, the number corresponding to the,
proposition that one of them is true is the sum or' those
corresponding |o the two original propositions.
4. The greatest "rod least numbers correspond to those
combiuations and only those in which the data imply
that the proposition is true or untrue respectively.
Several writers have defined probability as "quantity of
belief," or somewJmt better, "quantity of knowledge " ; these
are somewhat vague terms, and the transition from these
expressions to the number series has usually been carried out
without any explanation.
Yet the use of numb~rs for the
c,)mparison of probabilities at all was perhaps the greatest
advance ever made in the theory.
The above assumptions are independent ; they are involved
implicitly in every theory of probability yet introduced ; and
with their aid it is possible to make some progress with a
logical theory.
In the first place, we can show that the
nuniber corresponding to a proposition incompatible with the
data is zero.
For let a datum be that a,=l ; then on this
datum the propositions x= 2 and x= 3 are both false, and each
corresponds to the number a, where a is the least possible
number of L.hose involved in the correspondence.
is incompatible with x=3;
hence by axiom 3 the
probability that one of them is true is 2 a.
But the proposi-
tion "x=2 or x--=3" is incompatible with the datum "x= 1,"
and theret0re corresponds to a.
Thus 2 a is equal to a, and
a is therefore zero.
U, then, probabdities are to be repre-
sented by numbers, zero must be the least number involved;
but adjustments could be made in our assumptions which
would allow any other number to represent the nfinimum on
the scale.
If we divide all numbers of the series by that corresponding
to a proposition implied by the data, all tim above axioms will
apply equally to the numbers of the new series.
henceforth use the notation P (p:q) to denote the number of
tiffs series corresponding to the proposition 79 on the data q;
we have P(q:q)=l, and P(not-q:q)=O.

Then the following four

The second axiom vielfls as an obvious corollary tile famous
" principle of suffie[en~ reason"; according f.o this, equal
probabilities are assigned to propositions relative to data when
the data give no reason for expecting any one rather than any
Zn discussing the prot)lems o~ probability ~ Poincard,
after disposing of the view of Laplace and Boole, seems in-
clined to consider this principle as the only possible basis of"
the theory.
Substantially the same view is held by Jevons.
There is, however, an objection to basing the whole theory on
the principle of sufficient reason.
For the only way of passing
from the notion ot~ " more probable" to the numerical esti-
mate of probability in any particular case is to discover some
set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive alternatives, from
which we can pick out some by our judgment as more
probable than others; the most probable on the data then
receives the greatest numerical estimate.
But if we restrict
ourselves to cases where we can obtain a set o~ alternatives
tha~ shall be all equally probable, we are arbitrarily limiting
the field to which the theory can be applied.
indeed, only deal wi~h those~cases where some proposition
is certain on the data can be expressed as the disjunction
of a number of' equally probable and mutually exclusive
propositions; the probability of any proposition fhat can be
expressed as, or is implied by, the disjunction o~ 'my sub-class
of these eouhl then be assessed by means o~ the principle of
sufficient reason and axioms 3 an , we must assume
that axiom 2 is correct.
The assumption that information
can be obtained from the notion of " equally probable" alone
without that of " more probable," which seems as intelligible
c~ priori anyhow, demands that propositions can be decomposed
in this way in all these cases, whether there is any warrant
for assuming this possibility or not.
Thus axiom 2 is prefer-
able to the principle of sufficient reason as a primitive
proposition, since it covers as much ground and involves
fewer assumptions.
The use of the principle of sufficient reason in the cases
where it is applicable leads to a proof of another proposition
which is an axiom in Jevons's theory.
Suppose we have g
class o~ n proposi~ions, of which we know that one and only
one is true, and any oue is as likely to be true as any other.
Then if any m of them are selected, the probability that one
of these m is true is ~/.n.
Let q then denote the proposi~ion
that one of these m is true.
Consider another class of the
original propositions, and let t: denote the probability that
some member of this class is true.
The probability that p
and q are both true is then the probability that some member
of the common part of the two sub-classes is true.
number of propositions in this common part be 1.
denote the data we have at the beginning, we have
=P (p: q. :,). P(q: 70.
We see tha~ all cases where the probabilities of propositions
can be determined by decomposing a certain proposition into
a finite number of equally probable alternatives can be
treated in this way, so that the relation
P(p.q: h) =P(7,: q.h).l )(q:h)
is always true when the principle of sufficient reason is
appiieal~le.
Bu~ is there ;my reason to suppose that this relation still

holds when the principle is not applicable?
Some further
assumption is necessary before it can be proved in these cases,
and various suggestions could be offered that would bridge
the gap without making it necessary to suppose that the
relation is known a priori in these cases.
There seems,
however, to be little or no ground for deciding between them,
and the proposition may as well be assumed to hold in general
without further discussion.
From the propositions so far
assumed or proved, with judgments of greater, equal, or less
probability in particular cases, the mathematical theory of
probability can be developed.
Another point iu connexion with the them'y may be briefly
mentioned.
All that is strictly necessary in order that the
notions of probability may be capable of logical treatment is
that combinations of propositions and data can be arranged
in a series so that whenever a combination A is not more
probable than another, B, B shall n:)t precede A in the series.
With suitable assumptions regarding the position in the
series of a combination, such as the disjunction of two contra-
dictory prop)sitions referred to the same data, a theory could
be constructed.
There is no reason save convenience why
the number series should be the one employed for this
So long as we confine ourselves to those cases
where a proposition certain on the data can be decomposed
into a finite number of equally probable alternatives, and the
proposition whose probability is to be estimated is expressible
as or equivalent to the disjunction of a class of these, the
number series is obviously adequate ; in fact the series of all
rational proper fractions in ascending order of magnitude
would be adequate.
This latter series is, however, at once
found to be insufficient when we attempt to deal with cases
where the number of equally probable alternatives required
to cover the case considered is infinite.
This difficulty was
thought to be removed by using the series of all the real
numbers less than unity instead of that of the rational
But the question that arises now is, whether the
series of all the real numbers is itself adequate for the purpose,
and the answer seems to be in the negative, for there are
evidently cases where the use of infinitesimals is necessary to
a complete theory, and the discovery of others, necessitating
the introduction of infinitesimals of different orders, is practi-
cally certain.
For instance, suppose we are given that x is
a whole number, and that all whole numbers are equally
probable values of x.
What is the probability of any
particular value of x, say 1053 ?
Clearly it is not finitely
different from 0 ; for if it were X say, we could find a whole

number M whose reciprocal would be less than ~ ; bu~ I[M
is the probability of M being 1053 when there are only M
possible alternatives, and the probability cannot be increased
by increasing the number of alternatives.
Hence the pro-
bability that x is 1053 is less than any finite number, contrary
to what was assumed.
It is nevertheless different from zero,
for then there would be no nleans of distinguishing between
the probability of this, which is a perfectly possible pro-
position on the data, and that of' a proposition known to be
impossible on the data.
Hence this probability is less than
any finite number, and yet is different from zero; in other
words, it is an infinitesimal, in the original sense of the term ~.
Again, we can see that the probability of' a particular real
number chosen at random being rational is infinitesimal ; so
is the probability th'lt a function is analytic, given that all
functions are equally probable.
5Tow a complete theory of
probability must cover all these cases ; but so long as we are
confined to the series of the real numbers that is impossible ;
for if this has C members, the number of possible functions
whose values are real nmnbers is C c, which is greater ; hence
problems arising in connexion with the probability of func-
tions demand tim use of a series for comparison whose
members are more numerous than the real numbers.
series are known ; and perhaps one suitable for the purpose
may be constructed which will include among its members
:the real numbers themselves.
III. On Probabilitj Inference.
The characteristic feature of the type of3nference with
which classical logic is primarily concerned is that given the
premises it is possible to establish the conclusions with
absolute certainty from them.
In many cases, however, such
a result is unobtainable when it is nevertheless possible to

were the true number of white balls in the bag the probability
that p white balls and q others would he picked in p+q
trials would be "Cp =-"Cq
It follows that the prior
probability of a particular pair of values of i9 and g for a
given n is /~(n)--~cw---

probability, which follows easily from the proposition
e(l'.q:10=P
(P: q.l').P(9:G
the probabilities on the data o[ particular numbers of white
balls arc in the ratio of the probabilities of the actual values
of" p and q for these numbers of white balls; thus we find
that the probability that any particular value of n is the true
number of white balls in the bag, given the composition of
the sample, is
f(~) '%, "~-"cq+x,~f(,O '%, "-'%,
where the summation is to be extended to all possible values
Miss Wrinch and Dr. H. Jeffreys on some
This gives the solution of the problem in the most general
case, but in most cases more concise information, even though
it may be only approximate, is desirable.
The ease ex-
clusively considered in the discussions hitherto given is the
very simple one where f(n) is the same for all values of ~.
'~he ground for this evaluation may be either complete
ignorance of the relative number of white balls among the
balls ill the world, or knowledge tbat white and other balls
have occurred equally frequently in all the ratios possible in
this problem.
On this hypothesis it can be shown that the
probability of a white ball at the (p+q+l)th
drawing is
(p+l)/(p+q+2); and if q is 0, the probability that all the
balls in the bag are white is (p + 1)/(m+ 1).
It is however very rarely, it" ever, possible to assume, on the
data awdlable before the sample is taken, that f(n) is inde-
pendent of n, and cases where it has other values are much
more interesting.
For instance, we know that there is a
strong tendency for similar individuals to be associated, so
that the greatest and least values of n are more probable on
the initial data than the intermediate ones.
Or suppose we
are considering balls of another colour, say green.
be absurd to suggest that a bag is as likely to contain green
balls alone as to contain no green balls, for we know that in
~act green balls are no~ nearly so common as balls of all
othor colours together.
On ~he other hand in these cases it
is not usually possible to decompose the propositions, whose
probabilities we wish to assess in order to find f(n), into
equally probable alternatives, so that the principle of sufficient
reason cannot be applied; thus though we may be confident
thatf(n) lies within certain limits, we cannot say that it has
any particular value.
It will, however, be shown that unless
the form of this function is something very remarkable the
probabilities to be assigned to particular values of n are
practically independent of tlm prior probabilities, depending
almost wholly on the composition of the sample taken, pro-
vided this is large enough.
To show how this comes about
we need an approximation to '~Cp .... Cq when p and q are
fairly large.
This is best obtained by a method analogous
to that adopted by Dr. Bromwich*.
If r and s are both
large and v is large compared with s, formula (2) of
Dr. Bromwich's paper yields the approximation

which gives on substituting tile above approximation, pro-
vided mx is not so great as to invalidate it, an expression
that simI)lifies to

Hence the function considered is t~ maximum for ~=no, and
its values for other values of n are distributed about this
according to the G.uss law.
The given sample is said to be a fair o]e if p/(p+q) is
equal to the ratio of the true number of ~hite balls to the
whole number of balls in the bag.
The deviation from
fairness is therefore represented by x.
Substituting the
approximation (5) in the formula (1), we find by summation
that the probability that x lies between +__ e is

2~(p + q)+e is greater than h, the exponential is less than e -~,
which is very small even when h is not remarkably smM1.
Outside of the range the exponential factor is even smaller,
and unless f(n) is so great that its greatness can counteract
the smallness o[ tile expouential factor, the contribution to
the denominator from the values of x not between +e is
Thus the numerator and denominator are nearly
equal and the probability that x lies between + e is nearly 1.
Miss Wriuch and Dr. H. Jeffreys on son~e
We therefore ]lave the theorem: if a selection ofp+q mem-
bers from a class of m a's consists of p •'s and (! not-fl's, and
.f(n) the prior probability of there being n fi's and m--n not-B's
in the class a is such that when x is numerically greater than
e,f(n) is never so great that .f(n) exp--2(p+q)(x2--e ~ is
comparable with f{mp/(p+q)},
then the probability th:~t
n/m lies within e ofp/(p + q) differs from unity by a quantity
of order not greater than exp--2(p+q)e ~.
Thus, unless the
distribution of prior probability among various values of n
is very remarkable, i~s precise form does not produce much
effect on the probability that the true value lies within a
certain range determined wholly by the constitution of the
sample itself.
It is worthy of note that the range within which it is
probable that n/m must lie is of length proportion'd to
tp + c/)-~ ; it does not depend on m to any great extent, but
if p and q are very different the range may be much shorter
than this.
]:his leads to the result that there is a strong
presumption that a large sample is approximately a fair one
even it' it is small compared with the whole of the class; and
that the range within which the fractional composition is as
likely as not to lie is much the same however great the
whole number of individuals may be.
The fact that the error
likely to be committed in san(piing is, except in extreme
cases, limited by the size of the sample itself; may be of some
importance in electoral and economic questions.
]t is also
easy to infer from the results obtained that 1he probability
of drawing a ~3 at the next trial is not likely to be far from
p/(p+q), agreeing with sufficient accuracy with the result of
the ordinary theory.
In a recent paper* Mr. (L D. Broad has given a suggestive
discussion el th~ problem of inductive inference, in which he
adopts the ordinary theory, according to which when ~! is 0
the probability that all the members are/Ys is (p + 1)/(m + 1).
This is not necessarily true, for the reasons given above, but
this does not affect Mr. Broad's main point, which is that
in all ordinary cases the number of ohserved instances is so
small compared with the total number of instances that it is
impossible to arrive by this means at any noteworthy prob-
ability for a general law.
General laws are, however, of
-carious kinds.
The type to which Mr. Broad devotes most
attention is the statement that "all crows are hlack," based
on the fact that all observed crows have been black.
crow is an object defined by tlle conjunction of a number of
properties, which may or may not include bl,ckness.

former case tlle inference beconms tautologous, and we are
concerned only with the latter.
But it has been shown above
that if" ~ be the number of black crows in tile world, n/m is
not likely to deviate from p/(t~ + q) by more than a quantity
of the order of (p+q)-'~ ; anti in this case, "~s p is great and
q is zero, we are justified in inferring that the number of
crows tlmt are. not black is a small f,'action of the whole,
which is :dl that is inferred in practice ; for lhe possibility in
exceptio,ml cases of sport, albinos, and so on is well known.
The other type of general law is one that is held to he true
in ever, q instance of the entities to which it is held to apply.
Such a law cannot be derived by means of probability in-
ference, for it deals only with certainties.
Here Mr. Broad's
argument is valid, and uo such law can derive a reasonable
probahility from experience alone; some further datum is
One way of arriving at such laws may be sug-
gested here.
Suppose we have an a priori belief that, either
every x has the property ~b or every ;c has the property 4/'.
If then a single x, say c, is found to satisfy q) but not 5b, we
can infer deductively the Ulfiversal proposition that all x's
satisfy 6.
Such cases are fairly frequent: if [or instance
we consider that either Einstein's or Silberstein's form of the
principle of general relativity is true, a single fact contra-
dictory to one would anlount to a proof of the other in every
Before leaving the important, question of induction, we
propose to consider it, in relation to the Venn view.
Vmm's definition of probability be adopted the existence of a
numerical estimate of probability depends on the possibility
(at least, imagined) of indefinite l'epetition of the data, the
trut,h or falsehood of the proposilAon whose probability
relative to the data is to be es*imated being recorded a t each
repetition.
The probability is then the limit of the ratio of
the number of favourable eases to the number of all eases.
Now on this basis it is never possible, by what has been said
alre:tdy, to prove that in any given case such a limi~ will
All the axioms of the "undefined concept" fi~eory are
therefore indemonstrable, and must be assumed a priori in
the same way.
Even iu the simple cage of picking indis-
tinguishable balls out of a bag the probability of picking
any particular individual cannot be assessed without some
hypothesis about the limit of the results obtained by making
an indefinite number of selections, each ball being replaced
after being drawn.
In the problem of sampling induction
we can therefore by making enough assumptions of this
characeel', which tl!ere seems little or no reason to believe,
Miss Wrineh and Dr. H. Jcffreys on some
obtain a proof of ~ proposition superficially the same as the
chief theorem of this section ; but let us consider what this
result means on the Velm view.
It would mean that if we
had a large number of classes, each or" m members, and from
each we had picked out p + q members, of which p were/3's
and q not-/3's, then when the nmnber of such classes is in-
definitely increased the fraction of them in which the .lctual
number of 2's does not lie within certain limits wouht tend
to zero as a limit.
Thus the already hopeless task of pro-
ceeding to the limi~ of an infinite numbel" of observations
becomes in this case the still more complex one of repeating
similar classes indefinitely.
Such indefinite repetition ot' i~!finlte classes is called by
Venn the construction of "cross-serles" and forms an
essential ])art of his theory of inference.
It is necessary, for
instance, in giving a meaning to the proposition connecting
the probabilities of' a proposition referred to different data
P(l~.q:/~)=P(p:q.h).P(q:/O.
For an infinite series is
needed to give an account of P(p : q. ],), which is the limit
derived from the frequency of the h'uth of p among entities
for which q and h are true.
Such entities, however, are only a
part of those for which l~ holds.
Thus to establish a meaning
for the number P(p.q:]~) we must consider all entities
satisfying h, whether they sat~isfy q or not.
Thus further
series must be constructed which will show how often q is
actually true, and this requires, according to Venn, an infinite
number oF series of entities all satisfying h} so that we can
examine in one direction to find the f'requency of p given q
and h and in the other to find that of q given h.
difficulty of obtaining enough terms, acute in the simple case,
is here intensified ; further, there is no more reason to believe
in the existence of limits in this case than there was in the
The difficulties are merely complicated and not re-
moved by the use of cross-series.
There is no evidence that Venn ever attempted to meet
these difficulties.
Indeed, we may conclude from some
passages of his work that they ]tad never suggested then,-
The following passage, for example, occurs in the
third edition of his 'Logic of Chance,' page 208.
opinion according to which certain inductive formalin are
regarded as composing a portion of probability cannot, I
think, be maintained.
It would be more correct to say ....
that induction is quite distinct from probability, yet co-
operates in almost all its inferences.
By induction we
de~ermine for example whether and how far we can safely
generalise the proposition that 4 men in 10 live to be 56:

supposing such a proposition to be safely generalised we hand
it over to Probability to say what sort of inferences can be
deduced from it."
The "undefined concept" view of probability can be
devehTed so as to yield a theory of induction adequate for
scientific purposes.
There are difficulties in the way of
obtaining such a theory from the frequency view, and we
conclude that the balance is in favour of the "undefined
concept" view.
It is shown that the attempt to give a definition of
probability in terms of frequency is unsuccessful.
definition, apparently in these terms, really involves im-
plicitly the concept of probability and is therefore circular
in character.
Venn's definition in terms of the limit of a
series is unsatist'actory because there is no reason to believe
that his series do in fact usually tend to a limit ; it is shown
that there are many cases where they do not; and as his
process is incapable of being carried out, the existence of
such a limit can in any case only be known a priori if at all,
so tha~ his method offers no advantage over that of regarding
probability as an entity known to exist independently ot:
definition, intelligible without such definition, and perhaps
indefinable.
A set of axioms on which a mathematical theory of
probability can be based is then given, which seems to oiler
certain advantages over the current ones.
In particular it is
capable of covering cases where the principle of sufficient
reason cannot be applied to assess probability.
I~ is also
shown that a complete theory of probability must allow for
the use of infinitesimals.
A discussion of sampling induction is given, in which it
is shown that when the sample is large enough ~he prior
probabilities of differen~ constitutions of the whole do not
usually affect appreciably the probabilities inferred after the
samples have been taken.
Also the range within which
the fractional constitution is as likely as not to lie includes
the fi'actional constitution of the sample, and its extent is
inversely proportional to the number of the sample itself,
whatever be the number of the whole.
