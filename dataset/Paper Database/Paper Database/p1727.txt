Purpose: To establish and evaluate multiregional T2-weighted imaging (T2WI)based clinical-radiomics model for predicting lymph node metastasis (LNM)
and prognosis in patients with resectable rectal cancer.
Methods: A total of 346 patients with pathologically conﬁrmed rectal cancer
from two hospitals between January 2019 and December 2021 were
prospectively enrolled. Intra- and peritumoral features were extracted
separately, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression
was applied for feature selection. Radiomics signatures were built using the
selected features from different regions. The clinical-radiomic nomogram was
developed by combining the intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics
signatures score (radscore) and the most predictive clinical parameters. The
diagnostic performances of the nomogram and clinical model were evaluated
using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The
prognostic model for 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was constructed
using univariate and multivariate Cox analysis.
Results: The intratumoral radscore (radscore 1) included four features, the
peritumoral radscore (radscore 2) included ﬁve features, and the combined
intratumoral and peritumoural radscore (radscore 3) included ten features. The
AUCs for radscore 3 were higher than that of radscore 1 in training cohort (0.77
vs. 0.71, P=0.182) and internal validation cohort (0.76 vs. 0.64, P=0.041). The
AUCs for radscore 3 were higher than that of radscore 2 in training cohort (0.77
vs. 0.74, P=0.215) and internal validation cohort (0.76 vs. 0.68, P=0.083). A
clinical-radiomic nomogram showed a higher AUC compared with the clinical
model in training cohort (0.84 vs. 0.67, P<0.001) and internal validation cohort
(0.78 vs. 0.64, P=0.038) but not in external validation (0.72 vs. 0.76, P=0.164).
Multivariate Cox analysis showed MRI-reported extramural vascular invasion
(EMVI) (HR=1.099, 95%CI: 0.462-2.616; P=0.031) and clinical-radiomic
nomogram-based LNM (HR=2.232, 95%CI:1.238-7.439; P=0.017) were

Introduction
Rectal cancer ranks eighth among all cancers worldwide (1).
Lymph node metastasis (LNM) has been conﬁrmed to be a poor
prognostic factor in rectal cancer (2, 3). Preoperative prediction
of LNM can provide useful information for determining the
need for adjuvant therapy or surgical resection. Therefore, an
accurate prediction of LNM plays an important role in clinical
decision-making and improved prognosis (2, 4). Traditional
imaging methods mainly focus on the size, shape and edge of
lymph nodes to determine the lymph node status. However,
these morphological features alone are not sufﬁcient to reliably
identify LNM in rectal cancer because reactive or inﬂammatory
lymph nodes can be enlarged, normal-sized, or even small and
account for a signiﬁcant proportion of malignancy (5–7). An
alternative technical approach is needed to complement the
routine imaging tools used in the assessment of LNM.
Radiomics is a noninvasive method that allows the
extraction of quantitative features from medical images (8).
Several studies reported that CT- or MRI-based radiomics
features could predict LNM in other malignant tumors (9–11).
For rectal cancer, some studies reported that CT or MRI
radiomics signature-based nomograms of the primary tumor
have attained the ability to discriminate colorectal cancer
patients with or without LNM (12–14). However, these
previous reports only measured intratumoral regions, and the
peritumoral region, which may contain valuable information
about the tumor, was excluded. Tumor heterogeneity is not only
solely limited to cancer cells but also relates to nonmalignant and
inﬁltrating cells surrounding the tumor, commonly referred to
as the microenvironment. It is the interaction between tumor
cells and the surrounding microenvironment that inﬂuences
tumor evolution and progression (15). Several studies have
shown that radiomics based on peritumoural regions improves
the diagnostic performance for identifying LNM in other cancers
(16–18). Therefore, we can presume that radiomics derived from
intratumoral and peritumoral regions could also predict LNM in
rectal cancer. Furthermore, previous studies had small sample
sizes and lacked complete external validation cohorts. To the
best of our knowledge, there has been no study investigating
associations between preoperative MRI-radiomics signatures on
LNM and 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS). A recently study
reported that the advantage of radiomics offering better disease
characterization might allow better performance of radiomics
models based on T2WI alone, that is, without combining with
diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) (19). Therefore, the purpose
of this study was to develop and validate a T2WI-based clinicalradiomics model from intratumoral and peritumoral tissues for
the preoperative prediction of LNM and prognosis in patients
with resectable rectal cancer using a multicenter database.
Materials and methods
Study population
This prospective study was approved by the institutional
review board in our institution, and the requirement for
informed patient consent was obtained. From January 2019 to
December 2021, we prospectively recruited 431 patients with rectal
cancer from two hospitals who underwent radical surgery. We
included the following patients: (1) patients who underwent MRI
examination two weeks before surgery; (2) rectal adenocarcinoma
diagnosis based on pathology of surgical specimens; and (3) 12 or
more regional lymph nodes in the surgical specimen that needed to

be examined. We excluded the following lesions: (1) small lesions
invisible on T2-weighted images (T2WI) (n=7); (2) patients
underwent neoadjuvant therapy before surgery or MRI (n=50).
(3) suboptimal MR images due to movement artifacts or poor
resolution (n=6); (4) nonresectable and/or metastatic disease
(n=14); and (5) incomplete clinical data, such as lack of
presurgical carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] data (n=8). These
patients were divided into three groups, namely, the training
cohort (n=134) from hospital 1, the internal validation cohort
(n=56) from hospital 1 at a ratio of 7:3 based on the scanning date,
and an external validation cohort (n=156) from hospital 2. A
ﬂowchart of the study population is shown in Figure 1.
MRI acquisition
A 1.5-T MR scanner (MAGNETOM Aera, Siemens
Healthineers) was used at hospital 1, whereas a 3.0-T MR
scanner (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens, Healthineers) was
used at hospital 2. Before the MRI scan, 20 mg of scopolamine
butylbromide (Buscopan, Boehringer Ingelheim) was
intramuscularly injected to reduce bowel motion. Rectal
distention was not performed before MR examinations. For
hospital 1, the axial T2WI (perpendicular to the long axis of
the rectum) without fat saturation was performed with the
following protocol: TR/TE, 4600/75; ﬁeld of view (FOV), 220
mm2; matrix size, 256 × 512; and 3-mm thickness without an
interslice gap. For hospital 2, the following protocol was
employed: TR/TE, 4960/89; FOV, 200 mm2; matrix size, 320 ×
320; and 3-mm thickness without an intersection gap.
MRI evaluation
Two radiologists (the ﬁrst author and second author with 5
years and 12 years of experience in reporting rectal cancer
MRI, respectively) blinded to the histopathology results
reviewed the MR images in consensus. The tumor length
and tumor thickness were measured on the sagittal and
oblique axis T2WIs, respectively. extramural vascular
invasion (EMVI) positivity on MRI was deﬁned as follows:
(1) tumor signal intensity in a vascular structure, (2) dilated
vessels, and (3) tumoral extension through the vessel wall
invading the vessel border. Qualitative criteria of MRIreported lymph node metastasis were based on the 2016
European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal
Radiology consensus meeting (7). Disagreements between
two radiologists in the assessment of these features were
resolved through discussion.
Tumor segmentation and feature
extraction
A ﬂowchart of the radiomics process is shown in Figure 2.
One radiologist (the ﬁrst author) segmented the volumes of
interest of tumors on T2WI images with the AK software
(Artiﬁcial Intelligence Kit, version 3.3.0, GE Healthcare)
blinded to the histopathology results and a senior author
(the last author) with 20 years’ experience scrutinized them.
To acquire information at the invasive margin, peritumoral
regions were obtained with automated dilation of the tumor
boundaries by 2 mm on the outside and shrinkage of the
tumor boundaries by 1 mm on the inside, resulting in a ring
with a thickness of 3 mm (20). We carefully excluded obvious
vessels, peritumoral organs, and air cavities. Intraclass
correlation coefﬁcients (ICCs) were calculated to assess the
interobserver correlation coefﬁcient reproducibility of the
radiomic feature extraction. The reproducibility of radiomic
features between two observers (the ﬁrst author and second
author) was evaluated with ICC based on the ﬁrst 30 patients’
data. The subsequent feature extraction was performed by a
radiomic module (backed by Pyradiomics) embedded in the
open-source software package 3D Slicer (version 4.9, 107
 Gray level of T2WI was quantized to
25 gray levels. Seven radiomic features categories included 14
ﬁrst-order statistical features, 18 shape-based features, 22 gray
level co-occurrence matrix, 16 gray level size zone matrix, 16
gray level run length matrix, 14 gray level dependence matrix,
and 5 neighboring gray tone difference matrix. Moreover, two
image ﬁlters, wavelet and Laplacian of Gaussian were applied
to original images, respectively. Before the feature extraction, z
score normalization of the MRI signal intensities for T2WI.
Consequently, 1409 features were obtained for each of
intratumoral region and peritumoral region. The time
required for a senior radiologist to take segmentation was
controlled to 300 seconds while for a junior radiologist to take
segmentation was controlled to 600 seconds.

Feature selection and model building
The values of the features with ICC >0.75 were included for
subsequent analysis. ComBat harmonization was ﬁrst used to
remove batch effects that caused by the handling of samples by
different centers or different scanner/protocol that can obscure
individual variations (21). Feature selection and model building
were performed using R software (version 2.15.3 www.r-
114project.org).
The radiomics features were initially screened by
maximum relevance and minimum redundancy, and then
least absolute shrinkage selection operator regression was
used to select the most useful predictive features from the
training cohort. A radiomics signature score (radscore) was
calculated for each patient as a linear combination of the
selected features weighted by their respective coefﬁcients. The
predictive accuracy of the radscore was evaluated by the area
under the curve (AUC) in the training and validation cohorts.
The highest AUC value among the radscores was included in
the subsequent analysis.
Wilcoxon test was ﬁrst applied to all clinical risk factors
and radscore, and then the factors with P<0.05 in univariate
logistic regression was performed to choose the independent
predictors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was
performed to construct the combined model. The
nomogram and clinical model for predicting LNM were
constructed using the selected predictors. The Hosmer–
Lemeshow test was performed to assess the goodness-of-ﬁt
of the nomogram. Calibration curves were generated to
evaluate the calibration of the nomogram. The AUC was
calculated to assess the discrimination performances of the
clinical model and the nomogram for predicting LNM. The
clinical utility of the nomogram was evaluated by decision
curve analysis (DCA).
Patients with rectal cancer at pathological T1-2N0M0 after
surgery received “follow-up and watch” strategy, without giving
any adjuvant treatment. For patients at pathological T3-4N0M0 or
T1-4N1-2M0 after surgery, these patients received 5-ﬂuorouracilbased adjuvant therapy. Relapse was assessed every 3–6 months
based on clinical or radiological locoregional or distant
progression after surgery. The primary endpoint was 3-year RFS.
Statistical analysis
SPSS 23.0 (IBM) and R software were used for statistical
analysis. The baseline characteristics of patients with rectal
cancer were compared using Student’s t test, nonparametric
test, chi-squared test, and Fisher’s exact test (where appropriate).
The diagnostic performance was compared by ROC analysis,
and the difference in AUCs between these models was compared
using Delong’s test. The prognostic model for 3-year RFS was
constructed using univariate and multivariate Cox analysis.
Patient characteristics
A total of 346 patients (mean age 61.86 years, age range 26-
88 years) were included in this study population. Among the 346
patients with rectal cancer, 134 patients were in the training
cohort (66 pathologically reported LNM+ and 68 LNM-), 56
patients were in the internal validation cohort (27 pathologically
reported LNM+ and 29 LNM-), and 156 patients were in the
external validation cohort . Among these three cohorts, signiﬁcant
differences were found in MRI-reported EMVI (P= 0.031) and
tumor length (P=0.030), as shown in Table 1.
MR-reported LNM correlation with
pathologic results
MR-reported LNM correlation with pathologic results is
summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The correlation of
MR-reported LNM with pathologic results were validated with
Kappa of 0.248, with a sensitivity of 62.4% and speciﬁcity of
62.4%. Therefore, the correlation of MR-reported LNM with
pathologic results indicated poor consistency because the Kappa
value was less than 0.4.
Radscore evaluation
The intratumoral radscore (radscore 1) included four
features. The peritumoral radscore (radscore 2) included ﬁve
features. The combined intratumoral and peritumoural
radscore (radscore 3) included ten features (Supplementary
Figure 1). The ROC curves of radscore 1, radscore 2 and
radscore 3 were generated for predicting LNM in training and
internal validation cohorts (Figure 3). The radscore 3 achieved
a higher AUC compared with radscore 1 in training cohort
(0.770 vs. 0.710, P=0.182) and internal validation cohort
(0.760 vs. 0.640, P=0.041). The AUCs for radscore 3 were
higher than that of radscore 2 in training cohort (0.77 vs. 0.74,
P=0.215) and internal validation cohort (0.76 vs.
0.68, P=0.083).

visualizing the combined model, as shown in Figure 4. The
calibration curves and DCA results of the clinical-radiomics
nomogram are shown in Figure 5. Good calibration in training
cohort and validation cohort was identiﬁed using the Hosmer–
Lemeshow test (all P>0.05).
The AUCs for the clinical model were 0.67 (95% CI: 0.58-
0.76) and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.49-0.79) in training cohort and
internal validation cohort, respectively (Table 3). AUCs were
improved by adding the clinical model to the radscore 3. The
AUCs for the clinical-radiomic nomogram were higher than that
of the clinical model in training cohort (0.84 vs. 0.67, P<0.001)
and internal validation cohort (0.78 vs. 0.64, P=0.038). However,
the nomogram failed to outperform the clinical model in
external validation cohort (0.72 vs. 0.76, P=0.164).
Subgroup analyses
Subgroup analyses of the nomogram are shown in Figure 6.
Extranodal extension (ENE), which is deﬁned as the extension of
tumor cells through the nodal capsule into the perinodal fatty
tissue, is an adverse prognostic factor in rectal cancer (22–24).
Pathological specimens of 93 patients with LNM were reviewed
by a pathologist to determine the ENE status. In total, 38 patients
were ENE positive. The nomogram had a higher AUC than the
clinical model for identifying ENE (0.837 vs. 0.715, P=0.004).
Lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM) has a signiﬁcantly higher
risk of lateral pelvic recurrence compared to those who had
negative LLNM. LLNM is considered as distant metastasis that is
treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed
by surgery. Forty patients underwent dissection. There were 16
patients with LLNM conﬁrmed by pathological specimens.
Although the nomogram had a higher AUC than the clinical
model for identifying LLNM, the difference was not signiﬁcant
(0.752 vs. 0.715, P=0.538). Patients with N2 stage had worse
prognosis than the patients with N0 and N1 stage. In total, 56
patients with N2 stage were conﬁrmed by pathological specimen.
The nomogram had a higher AUC than the clinical model for
differentiating N2 stage from LNM-negative patients, but the
difference was not signiﬁcant (0.688 vs. 0.606, P=0.109). For
patients at T1-T2 stage without LNM, these patients can receive
surgery without giving preoperative nCRT. At T1-T2 stage
patients, there were 18 patients with LNM and 42 patients
without LNM. The nomogram had a higher AUC than the
clinical model for identifying LNM (0.813 vs. 0.697, P=0.034).
For patients at T3 stage without high risk factors such as LNM,
these patients can receive surgery and then giving postoperative
adjuvant therapy. At T3 stage patients, there were 103 patients
with LNM and 93 patients without LNM. The nomogram had a
higher AUC than that of the clinical model for identifying LNM
(0.739 vs. 0.629, P=0.003).

Survival analysis
The median follow-up in the event-free population was 26
months (range, 5–36 months) in training cohort, 26 months
(range, 6–36 months) in testing cohort, and 36 months (range,
5–36 months) in external validation cohort. The rate of
recurrence in patients with LNM was higher than that of those
without LNM (31.8% vs. 16.9%). Among the 134 patients in the
training cohort, locoregional or distant relapse occurred in 30
patients (22.4%) after a median duration of 21 months (4–36
months). Among the 56 patients in validation cohort,
locoregional or distant relapse occurred in 14 patients (25%)
after a median duration of 22 months (4–36 months). Among
the 156 patients in external validation cohort, locoregional or
distant relapse occurred in 41 patients (26.2%) after a median
duration of 31.5 months (3–36 months). Kaplan−Meier survival
curves showed that the patients with low clinical-radiomic
nomogram score had better 3-year RFS than those with high
scores in training cohort, internal validation cohort, external
validation cohort, and at T3-T4 stage (all P<0.05) (Figure 7). In
the training cohort, univariate Cox analysis revealed age, MRIreported EMVI and clinical-radiomic nomogram-based LNM
were correlated with 3-year RFS (all P<0.05). Multivariate Cox
analysis showed MRI-reported EMVI (HR=1.099, 95%CI: 0.462-
2.616; P=0.031) and clinical-radiomic nomogram-based LNM
(HR=2.232,95%CI:1.238-7.439; P=0.017) were independent risk
factors for 3-year RFS (Table 4). The prognostic model for 3-year
RFS prediction was constructed with MRI-reported EMVI and
clinical-radiomic nomogram-based LNM and indicated good
performance, with AUC of 0.748 in training cohort, 0.706 in
internal validation and 0.688 in external validation cohort.
Discussion
In the current study, the radscore 3 outperformed the radscore
1 and radscore 2 for identifying LNM. After adding the radscore 3
model to the clinical model, our study revealed that the clinicalradiomics nomogram could signiﬁcantly improve diagnostic
performance compared to the clinical model in training cohort
and internal validation cohort. However, the clinical-radiomic
nomogram failed to outperform the clinical model in external
validation cohort, but the difference was not signiﬁcant. Moreover,
prognostic model constructed by MRI-reported EMVI and
clinical-radiomic nomogram-based LNM indicated good
performance for predicting 3-year RFS.
The radscore 3 consisting of 10 radiomics features could
predict LNM with acceptable performance in training cohort
(AUC of 0.77) and internal validation cohort (AUC of 0.76). Of
the 10 radiomics features, peritumoral features accounted for most
of the features in radscore 3 (6/10, 60%). In this study, the two
important positive coefﬁcients of radiomics features included
interquartile range and skewness extracted from peritumoral
region. Interquartile range is the 25th and 75th percentile of the
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the nomogram and clinical model for differentiating extranodal extension (ENE) positive from
lymph node metastasis (LNM) negative (A), lateral lymph node positive from LNM negative (B), and N2 stage from LNM negative (C). At T1-T2
stage subgroup analysis, ROC curves of nomogram and clinical model for predicting LNM (D). At T3 stage subgroup analysis, ROC curves of a

the greater difference between the range of gray values in the region
of interest, which implies the inhomogeneous intensity of tumor.
Therefore, the two positive coefﬁcient of radiomic features
indicating the tumor heterogeneity suggested that the
peritumoral region around the rectum is important in the
formation of LNM. Our study found that radscore 3 model
showed minor improvements in diagnostic efﬁcacy compared
with radscore 1 and radscore 2 model. Wavelet features are
extracted from the images transformed by a wavelet ﬁlter.
Consistent with a previous study (25), the selected radiomic
signature in this study was mainly constructed by wavelet

features (6/10, 60%). Another study also reported the effectiveness
of wavelet features on T2WI in predicting lymph node status (26).
Therefore, these results conﬁrmed that wavelet features better
reﬂected tumor heterogeneity. Some studies have reported that
some clinical characteristics are related to LNM (27–29). Our study
found that cT stage, MRI-reported EMVI and CEA were
independent predictors for LNM, suggesting that patients with
rectal cancer with LNM are more likely to have a high T stage, CEA
level or EMVI+. Moreover, a model derived from these clinical
characteristics had a slightly higher AUC than that of the
nomogram in external cohort (0.76 vs. 0.72). This result could be
attributed to the characteristics of the study population itself as
greater than half of patients in external cohort have LNM (88/
156, 56.4%).
Most previous studies based on radiomics have mainly
focused on features from intratumoral regions in rectal cancer.
Huang et al. showed that a CT-based radiomics nomogram can be
used to facilitate the preoperative prediction of LNM with a
concordance index of 0.736–0.778 (12). Meng et al. reported
that incorporating a multiparametric radiomic signature and
MRI-reported LN status had an AUC of 0.697 (29). Compared
with these studies, the AUC of the nomogram in our study was
slightly higher. This ﬁnding could be explained by the
multiregional radiomics feature extraction in our study. Other
previous studies reported that a multiparametric MRI-based
radiomics nomogram for the tumor region alone showed a
slightly improved diagnostic performance compared with that
noted in our study (14, 25). However, the sample size in these
studies was relatively small, and these retrospective studies lacked
independent external validation. Moreover, multiparametric
MRI-based radiomics, especially for incorporating DWI-based
radiomics features that could be inﬂuenced by MRI systems or bvalues, is not stable and typically exhibits different diagnostic
performance. Total mesorectal excision was introduced to reduce
the local recurrence because the probable microtumors around the
cancer have been completely removed. Therefore, the importance
of the perirectal tissue status may possess some crucial biological
information, including potential predictive markers. Liu et al.
demonstrated that clinical data combined with multiregionalbased MRI radiomics can improve the diagnostic efﬁcacy in
predicting LNM (30). Jayaprakasam et al. reported that
radiomics features of mesorectal fat can predict tumor response
after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (31). However,
peritumoral regions in this study were deﬁned the region along
the mesorectal fascia and the outer edge of the tumor and rectal
wall. Several previous studies in other tumors indicated that
peritumoral regions were deﬁned as the area immediately
surrounding the tumor (18, 20, 32, 33). Some studies also
reported metabolic changes in the peritumoral region, including
increased uptake of FDG by the tissues adjacent to the tumor
compared with distant tissues (34, 35). Therefore, we chose a 3mm area around the tumor boundary as the peritumoral region
according to previous studies (18, 20).
Regarding subgroup analyses, patients with LNM≥4 (stage
N2) had at least stage III rectal cancer (36). Different treatments
and outcomes are noted between stage I-II and III rectal cancer
patients. Our results showed that the nomogram had moderate
value for differentiating N2 stage from LNM-negative patients.
ENE was associated with a poorer prognosis in colorectal cancer
patients (37). The nomogram had good diagnostic performance
(AUC, 0.837) for differentiating ENE-positive from LNMnegative patients. Our study showed that the nomogram had
moderate diagnostic performance (AUC, 0.752) for
differentiating LLN-positive from LNM-negative patients. At
T1-T2 stage subgroup analysis, we found that the nomogram
had good diagnostic performance for identifying LNM (AUC,
0.813). In T3 stage subgroup analysis, the nomogram had
moderate diagnostic performance for identifying LNM (AUC,
0.739). Although the sample size in these subgroup analyses was
small, our study provided preliminary evidence to conﬁrm that
the nomogram could potentially assess these subgroups. In
addition, we further reported that the rate of recurrence
in patients with LNM was increased compared with that noted
in those without LNM (51.9% vs. 8.3%). We found the patients
with low clinical-radiomic nomogram score had better 3-year
RFS than those with high scores. MRI-reported EMVI has been
conﬁrmed to be strongly associated with distant recurrence (38).
In this study, multivariate Cox analysis showed MRI-reported
EMVI and clinical-radiomic nomogram-based LNM were
shown to be adverse prognostic factors for 3-year RFS.
Prognostic model constructed by these two indicators
indicated good performance for predicting 3-year RFS. These
results may indicate T-stage and N-stage are not enough for
classifying the patient, while combination of more indicators,
such as clinical-radiomic nomogram-based LNM and MRIreported EMVI, is more sensible.
Our study has several limitations. First, the sample size was
relatively small, especially in the subgroup analysis. It is still
necessary to expand the sample size in further study. Second,
although a dilation distance of 3 mm around the tumor was
deﬁned as the peritumoral region in this study, we did not
compare the different dilation distances. Third, the data were
obtained from two different centers with different scanning
devices. However, ComBat harmonization was used to
efﬁciently remove the scanner/protocol effect. Fourth, even
though DWI is routinely included in rectal MRI protocols and
offers several beneﬁts in various applications, it also has multiple
possible shortcomings. Manual drawing of ROIs onto the tumor
for quantitative or qualitative assessment may result in
interobserver variation. Furthermore, image distortion due to
artifacts is common on DWI, particularly around air tissue
interfaces. These shortcomings may interfere with radiologists
in drawing tumor ROI. Finally, our ﬁndings are applicable to
resectable rectal cancer, whereas patients who had a
contraindication for surgery were excluded. Therefore, a
selection bias might exist.

In conclusion, our study conﬁrmed clinical-radiomics
nomogram exhibits good clinical potential for predicting
preoperative LNM. Prognostic model constructed by MRIreported EMVI and clinical-radiomic nomogram-based LNM
indicated good performance for predicting 3-year RFS. These
results can assist predicting preoperative LNM and
identifying high-risk patients with rectal cancer for
assessing 3-year RFS.
