Pasteurized, it is possible to produce only a
mild butter. In order to procure the more pronounced flavor as desired here, the cream is
allowed to ripen and a 'starter' removed for
the followring day. In this way butter having a
characteristic flavor may be produced without
the use of a pure culture.
Professor Corn believed that the ripening of cream takes place
in two stages; the first being the rapid growth
of certaini albumen-destroying bacteria; and
the second, the rapid growth of lactic-acidproducing bacteria.
In completely ripened
cream the latter only are present and constitute the pure Danish cultures which give mild

It is interesting to note that
pure cultures are used in this country to a
greater extent by the producers of oleoinargarine and 'process' butter than by the dairymen.

DISCUOSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE.
AN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS.
I AM not aware whether any discussion has
been published, but it must have been keenly
felt by everybody associated with the physical

It seems to me that what
we nieed is a clearing house or, better, a trust
of American research literature, and the pooling in the present instance will be all the more
justifiable as it will be nearly pure altruism.
Few of the higher order of journals-I mean
those which offer non-popular scientific articles-really pay.

at a loss.

There is some reason for this state- of things.
If we were brutally frank we might agree that
a man with us is hardly eininent until he has
been acknowledged as an intellectual commodity
in some foreign market.
From some points of
view this self-distrust and lack of independent
judgment is laudable; but there is also a habtt

The question to
consider is whether it is not now high time for
us, in turn, to awake to a spirit of scientific
patriotism.
One does not have to read many
books to learn with what enthusiasm an Englishman, a Frenchman or a German refers to
the real intellectual accomplishments of his
countrymen.
Is there such pride among us?
I doubt it.
There is rather a tendency to exhaust all other bibliography first.
Somebody has wisely said that for the English-speaking race there is but one aristocracy,
and that it has taken the vigor of England to
Certainly the daughters of our millionaires offer much convincing
if not eloquent testimony. In a somewhat similar sense,
it seems to me that the aristocracy of Anierican scientists also resides in England, though
one cannot deny that the continent has somne
fascination.
Our efficient scientific men are
apt to outgrow the American Association first,
then they outgrow the iNTational Academy, and
finally the country itself is altogether too small
Their voices reach us in this final

It is all very nice as a well-devised
scheme of gradation, but where is the spirit
of patriotism in all this? Can we ever hope to
reach intellectual maturity in the eyes of the
world if we belittle the dignity of our own
institutions? Self-confessed incompetency may
be a virtue, but one should at least first be
sure that the incompetency really exists.

birth of their distinguLished countryman by
erecting in the town of his birth a permanent
memorial of his work and worth.
It is now hoped that this proposition will
ineet a response sufficiently cordial and generous to justify the foundation of a Hugh

as a resting place for the personal relics of the
man, but the home of scientific collections and
a library.
