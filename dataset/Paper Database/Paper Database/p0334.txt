To understand the impact of spatial heterogeneity of environment and movement of individuals
on the persistence and extinction of a disease, a spatial SIS reaction-diﬀusion model is studied,
with the focus on the existence, uniqueness and particularly the asymptotic proﬁle of the steadystates. First, the basic reproduction number R0 is deﬁned for this SIS PDE model. It is shown
that if R0 < 1, the unique disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotic stable and there is no
endemic equilibrium. If R0 > 1, the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and there is a unique
endemic equilibrium.
A domain is called high (low) risk if the average of the transmission rates is greater (less)
than the average of the recovery rates. It is shown that the disease-free equilibrium is always
unstable (R0 > 1) for high-risk domains. For low-risk domains, the disease-free equilibrium is
stable (R0 < 1) if and only if infected individuals have mobility above a threshold value. The
endemic equilibrium tends to a spatially inhomogeneous disease-free equilibrium as the mobility
of susceptible individuals tends to zero. Surprisingly, the density of susceptible for this limiting
disease-free equilibrium, which is always positive on the subdomain where the transmission rate is
less than the recovery rate, must also be positive at some, but not all, places where the transmission
rates are greater than the recovery rates.

Introduction
There have been some recent theoretical studies on SI-type reaction-diﬀusion models. For references to other spatial deterministic epidemic models, we refer the reader to excellent surveys by
Fitzgibbon and Langlais (to appear), Ruan (to appear), and Thieme .
In two papers, Fitzgibbon et al. study a family of SIR (susceptible-infectedrecovered) models that can include spatially-dependent terms for diﬀusion, convection, disease
transmission, and population demography. They include novel model features such as the presence
of an additional state variable to denote the fraction of the environment which is contaminated
(and can therefore cause infection) as well as the inclusion of “compartmental” or “diﬀractive
diﬀusion” appropriate for populations living in fragmented habitats. Some of their results include
the existence of unique solutions which are nonnegative and bounded, gradient estimates, and the
existence of global attractors.
Beardmore and Beardmore model disease dynamics on a one-dimensional interval for
a species which moves both randomly according to spatially-dependent diﬀusion and also by
spatially-dependent convection towards a “focal point” (or den). Their model incorporates population demography and their main theoretical results concern the outcome of the disease for
diﬀerent relative values of birth rate, uninfected death rate, and infected death rate. They numerically simulated diseases which can make infected individuals “dumb” (reducing their diﬀusion
coeﬃcients) or “furious” (increasing their diﬀusion coeﬃcients), a theme which we consider in
depth in this paper. Gudelj et al. and Gudelj and White combine social structure
and movement by including two mutant species which diﬀer only in the location of their focal
points. These species are social in that an infected individual of either group can infect any susceptible individual by making contact according to a mass action law. They study the stability of
steady-state solutions and the existence of invariant regions. These papers are based on an earlier
non-spatial model by Beardmore and White .
In theoretical investigations of a continuous time SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) epidemic patch model, Allen et al. showed that when susceptible and infected individuals
can move between patches, then an endemic equilibrium is reached in every patch. But if the
movement pattern is changed so that only infected individuals disperse between the patches a
surprising result occurs. The disease does not persist in any patch at equilibrium. Moreover,
at equilibrium, all low-risk patches (where the patch reproduction numbers are less than one)
contain susceptibles, and in some cases, high-risk patches (where the patch reproduction numbers
are greater than one) can also contain susceptibles. In this paper, we investigate these phenomena
in a continuous-time and continuous-space SIS model that includes both low-risk and high-risk
Here, we consider a frequency-dependent SIS reaction-diﬀusion model for a population inhabiting a continuous spatial habitat. The habitat is characterized as low-risk (or high-risk) if the
spatial average of the transmission rates is less than (or greater than) the spatial average of the
recovery rates, respectively. Individual site is also characterized as low-risk (or high-risk) if the
local transmission rate is less than (or greater than) the local recovery rate, which is equivalent
to the local reproduction number being less than (or greater than) one, respectively.
Our results link spatial heterogeneity and rates of movement to disease persistence and extinction. In our ﬁrst theorem, a unique disease-free equilibrium is shown to exist, a basic reproduction number R0 is determined by a variational problem, and we show that if R0 < 1 then the
disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. The second theorem relates the basic
reproduction number to the heterogeneity of the spatial domain. It is shown that for low-risk
domains, the disease-free equilibrium is stable (R0 < 1) if and only if the mobility of infected
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
individuals lies above a threshold value. For high-risk domains the disease-free equilibrium is
always unstable (R0 > 1). In the third theorem we show that if the disease-free equilibrium is
unstable (R0 > 1) then a unique endemic equilibrium exists. The fourth theorem demonstrates
that when the endemic equilibrium exists, it approaches a spatially inhomogeneous disease-free
equilibrium as the mobility of susceptible individuals approaches zero. This limiting disease-free
equilibrium has a positive number of susceptible individuals at all low-risk sites and also on some
(but not all) high-risk sites. These results have important implications for disease control. If the
spatial environment can be modiﬁed to include low-risk sites (i.e., low transmission rates or high
recovery rates) and if the movement of susceptible individuals can be restricted then it may be
possible to eliminate the disease.
Let Ωbe a bounded domain in Rm (m ≥1) with smooth boundary ∂Ω(when m > 1). Consider
the SIS reaction-diﬀusion model
∂t = dS∆¯S −β ¯S ¯I
¯S + ¯I + γ ¯I,
∂t = dI∆¯I + β ¯S ¯I
¯S + ¯I −γ ¯I,
where ¯S(x, t) and ¯I(x, t) denote the density of susceptible and infected individuals at location x
and time t; dS and dI are positive diﬀusion coeﬃcients for the susceptible and infected populations;
and β(x) and γ(x) are positive H¨older-continuous functions on Ωthat represent the rates of
disease transmission and recovery at x, respectively. Because ¯S ¯I/( ¯S + ¯I) is a Lipschitz continuous
function of ¯S and ¯I in the open ﬁrst quadrant, we extend its deﬁnition to the entire ﬁrst quadrant
by deﬁning it to be zero when either ¯S = 0 or ¯I = 0. We will assume no-ﬂux boundary conditions
and that there are initially a positive number of infected individuals, i.e.,
Ω¯I(x, 0) dx > 0, with ¯S(x, 0) ≥0 and ¯I(x, 0) ≥0 for x ∈Ω.
By the maximum principle , both ¯S(x, t) and ¯I(x, t) are positive
for x ∈Ωand t ∈(0, Tmax), where Tmax is the maximal existence time for solutions of (1.1).
Again by the maximum principle, both ¯S(x, t) and ¯I(x, t) are bounded on Ω× (0, Tmax). Hence,
it follows from the standard theory for semilinear parabolic systems that Tmax = ∞and that a
unique classical solution ( ¯S, ¯I) of (1.1) exists for all time . Let
 ¯S(x, 0) + ¯I(x, 0)
be the total number of individuals in Ωat t = 0. Summing (1.1a) and (1.1b) and then integrating
over Ωgives
 dS ¯S + dI ¯I
 dS ¯S + dI ¯I
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
We conclude that the total population size is constant, i.e.,
We say that x is a low-risk site if the local disease transmission rate β(x) is lower than the
local disease recovery rate γ(x). A high-risk site is deﬁned in a similar manner. Let
H−= {x ∈Ω: β(x) < γ(x)}
H+ = {x ∈Ω: β(x) > γ(x)}
denote the set of these low- and high-risk sites, respectively. For reference, these sets are illustrated
in Figure 1. Let R0(x) = β(x)/γ(x) be the local reproduction number at x ∈Ω. Then R0(x) < 1
for low-risk sites (x ∈H−) and R0(x) > 1 for high-risk sites (x ∈H+). It is well-known that
without movement, the disease can persist at high-risk sites but not at low-risk sites. We say that
Ωis a low-risk domain if
Ωγ and a high-risk domain if
We assume that β −γ changes sign on Ω, i.e.,
(A2) H−and H+ are nonempty.
By continuity, the set H◦= {x ∈Ω: β(x) = γ(x)} is also nonempty. We will sometimes assume
(A3) H◦consists of ﬁnitely many disjoint C1-surfaces (or ﬁnitely many points if m = 1, each of
which is a simple root of β −γ).
The equilibrium problem
We will be interested primarily in equilibrium solutions of (1.1), i.e., solutions of the elliptic
dS∆˜S −β ˜S ˜I
+ γ ˜I = 0,
dI∆˜I + β ˜S ˜I
−γ ˜I = 0,
with boundary conditions
Here, ˜S(x) and ˜I(x) denote the density of susceptible and infected individuals, respectively, at
x ∈Ωat equilibrium. In view of (1.3), we impose the additional condition
We are only interested in solutions ( ˜S, ˜I) of (1.4) which satisfy ˜S ≥0 and ˜I ≥0 on Ω. A
disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is a solution in which ˜I(x) = 0 for every x ∈Ω. An endemic
equilibrium (EE) is a solution in which ˜I(x) > 0 for some x ∈Ω. To distinguish between these
two types of equilibria, we will for notational convenience denote a DFE by ( ˆS, 0) and an EE by
( ˜S, ˜I).
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
Statement of the main results
We consider in Sect. 2 properties of the DFE, including its existence, uniqueness, and stability.
We also deﬁne a basic reproduction number R0 for (1.1).
Theorem 1. Suppose that (A1)-(A2) hold and N is ﬁxed. There exists a DFE, it is unique, and
it is given by ( ˆS, 0) = (N/|Ω|, 0). Let
ΩdI|∇ϕ|2 + γϕ2
If R0 < 1 then the DFE is globally asymptotically stable, but if R0 > 1 then it is unstable.
Our variational characterization of the basic reproduction number R0 is in keeping with the
next generation approach for heterogeneous populations which occupy a continuous spatial habitat, and it was inspired by earlier disease
models with movement between discrete patches . It is also interesting to note that R0 does not depend on the value of the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient dS for susceptibles.
In Sect. 2, we also show that the basic reproductive number R0 is a monotone decreasing
function of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient dI for infected individuals which tends to the maximum local
reproduction number as dI becomes arbitrarily small and to the average transmission rate divided
by the average recovery rate as dI becomes arbitrarily large. We also ﬁnd an equivalent characterization for the stability of the DFE in terms of dI rather than R0. In particular, the DFE in a
low-risk domain is stable if and only if dI lies above a certain threshold value, but in a high-risk
domain, the DFE is always unstable.
Theorem 2. Suppose that (A1)-(A2) hold and N is ﬁxed.
(a) R0 is a monotone decreasing function of dI with R0 →max{β(x)/γ(x) : x ∈Ω} as dI →0
Ωγ as dI →∞;
(b) In a low-risk domain (
Ωγ), there exists a threshold value d∗
I ∈(0, ∞) such that
R0 > 1 for dI < d∗
I and R0 < 1 for dI > d∗
(c) In a high-risk domain (
Ωγ), we have R0 > 1 for all dI.
Some comments about d∗
: ϕ ∈W 1,2(Ω) and
(β −γ)ϕ2 > 0
We refer to Cantrell and Cosner for such characterizations and related references. Observe
Ωγ then the right-hand side of (1.5) is equal to zero. In this case, we can deﬁne
In Sect. 3, we show that when the DFE is unstable, then there exists a unique EE. Moreover,
the disease persists everywhere.
Theorem 3. Suppose that (A1)-(A2) hold and N is ﬁxed. An EE exists if and only if the DFE
is unstable (R0 > 1). Furthermore, when it exists, the EE is unique and both ˜S and ˜I are positive
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
Observe from (1.4) that in the limiting case dS = 0 there also exists a family of inﬁnitely many
spatially inhomogeneous DFEs ( ˆS, 0), each of which satisﬁes
ˆS ≥0 on Ω,
∂n = 0 on ∂Ω,
It is natural to inquire about the connection between these spatially inhomogeneous DFEs and the
unique EE as dS approaches zero. In Sect. 4, we show that if R0 > 1 then the EE approaches such
a spatially inhomogeneous DFE as the mobility of susceptible individuals becomes very small. We
write this limiting DFE as (S∗, 0) and also consider the distribution of sites for which S∗is either
positive or zero (see Figure 2).
Theorem 4. Suppose that (A1)-(A2) hold and N is ﬁxed.
(a) ( ˜S, ˜I) →(S∗, 0) in C1(Ω) as dS →0 for some S∗(x) ∈C1(Ω) satisfying (1.6);
= {x ∈Ω: S∗(x) > 0} contains H−;
(c) J+ def
= {x ∈Ω: S∗(x) = 0} has positive measure and is contained in H+;
(d) If (A3) also holds, then J−contains H−, and the set J−\ H−has positive measure. Moreover, if m = 1, then the measure of J−\ H−tends to zero as dI →0.
Some comments about Theorem 4. First, this theoretical study is motivated primarily by the
question of how the long time behavior of ( ¯S, ¯I) depends upon the susceptible diﬀusion coeﬃcient
dS. We conjecture that if dS is suﬃciently small, then the EE is globally asymptotically stable and
it closely approximates some spatially inhomogeneous DFE. Theorem 4 (a) conﬁrms the second
part of this conjecture. Another prediction of Theorem 4 is that, in the limiting DFE, susceptibles
will not only occupy all low-risk sites but will also occupy some high-risk sites. It remains to show
the global asymptotic stability of the EE for small values of dS. However, it is unknown whether
the EE is even locally stable, and we hope that Theorem 4 will guide future attempts to prove
stability of the EE when dS is very small.
Second, it can be shown that the function S∗belongs to C1(Ω) ∩C2(J−) and satisﬁes the free
boundary problem
dI∆S∗+ (S∗−C)(β −γ) = 0
S∗= ∇S∗= 0
where C is a positive constant. One technical diﬃculty to extend Theorem 4 (d) to m ≥2 is our
lack of understanding of the regularity of the free boundary ∂J−.
The Disease-Free Equilibrium
Throughout this section, we assume that (A1) and (A2) hold and that N is ﬁxed. Theorem 1
follows from Lemmas 2.1, 2.4, and 2.5, and Theorem 2 is a consequence of Lemmas 2.3 and 2.4.
Existence and uniqueness of the DFE
Eq. (1.4) has a unique disease-free solution, and it is spatially homogeneous.
Lemma 2.1. A DFE ( ˆS, 0) exists, it is unique, and it is given by ˆS ≡N/|Ω| on Ω.
Proof. It is clear from (1.4) that (N/|Ω|, 0) is a DFE. Now, let ( ˜S, 0) be any DFE. It follows from
(1.4) with ˜I = 0 that ∆˜S = 0 for x ∈Ωand ∂˜S/∂n = 0 for x ∈∂Ω. The maximum principle
implies that ˜S is constant on Ω. In view of (1.4d) with ˜I = 0, we obtain ˜S ≡N/|Ω| on Ω.
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
An eigenvalue problem
So that we may study the stability of the DFE in Lemma 2.1, it will be useful to consider ﬁrst
an eigenvalue problem which is associated with (1.1). We linearize (1.1a) and (1.1b) around the
DFE to obtain
∂t = dS∆η −(β −γ)ξ,
x ∈Ωand t > 0,
∂t = dI∆ξ + (β −γ)ξ,
x ∈Ωand t > 0.
Here, η(x, t) = ¯S(x, t) −ˆS(x) and ξ(x, t) = ¯I(x, t). Suppose that (η, ξ) = (e−λtφ, e−λtψ) is a
solution of the linear system where λ ∈R, φ = φ(x), and ψ = ψ(x). We substitute this solution
into the linearized equations and divide by e−λt to get the following linear eigenvalue problem
dS∆φ −(β −γ)ψ + λφ = 0,
dI∆ψ + (β −γ)ψ + λψ = 0,
Observe that (2.1b) decouples from (2.1a). In view of (1.1c), we must have that
Observe from (1.3) and Lemma 2.1 that
(η + ξ) = 0.
Therefore,
(φ + ψ) = 0.
By the Krein-Rutman Theorem , if (λ, ψ) is a solution of (2.1b)
with ψ ̸≡0 on Ωthen λ is real. Furthermore, there exists a least eigenvalue λ∗, its corresponding
eigenfunction ψ∗can be chosen to be positive on Ω, and no other eigenvalue λ has an eigenfunction
ψ which is positive everywhere. Observe that (λ∗, ψ∗) satisﬁes
dI∆ψ∗+ (β −γ)ψ∗+ λ∗ψ∗= 0 for x ∈Ω
∂n = 0 for x ∈∂Ω.
It is well-known that λ∗is given by the following variational characterization:
dI|∇ϕ|2 + (γ −β)ϕ2
: ϕ ∈W 1,2(Ω) and
It can be shown also that λ∗and ψ∗are both diﬀerentiable functions of dI (Cantrell and Cosner
Lemma 2.2. The following statements about λ∗= λ∗(dI) hold.
(a) λ∗is a strictly monotone increasing function of dI > 0;
(b) λ∗→min{γ(x) −β(x) : x ∈Ω} < 0 as dI →0;
Ω(γ −β) as dI →∞;
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
Ωγ then λ∗< 0 for all dI > 0;
Ωγ then the equation λ∗(dI) = 0 has a unique positive root denoted by d∗
Furthermore, if dI < d∗
I then λ∗< 0 and if dI > d∗
I then λ∗> 0.
Proof. We need only to prove parts (a)-(c), because parts (d) and (e) follow immediately from
(a) The fact that λ∗is a monotone increasing function of dI is clear by inspection of (2.3). We
now show that this dependence is strict. We diﬀerentiate both sides of (2.2) by dI to get
∆ψ∗+ dI∆(ψ∗)′ + (β −γ)(ψ∗)′ + (λ∗)′ψ∗+ λ∗(ψ∗)′ = 0,
and ∂(ψ∗)′/∂n = 0 for x ∈∂Ω. Here, the prime notation denotes diﬀerentiation by dI.
We now multiply (2.2) by (ψ∗)′ and (2.4) by ψ∗, subtract the resulting equations, and then
integrate by parts over Ωto get (λ∗)′ R
Ω|∇ψ∗|2. Since ψ∗> 0 on Ω, it follows
that (λ∗)′ ≥0, with equality possible only if ψ∗is constant on Ω. But if ψ∗is constant on
Ωthen it must be a positive constant. Eq. (2.2) implies then that β(x) −γ(x) + λ∗= 0 for
every x ∈Ω, a contradiction because the function β −γ changes sign on Ω. We conclude
that (λ∗)′ > 0.
(b) This result appears as Lemma 3.1 in .
(c) It is easy to see from (2.3) with ϕ2 ≡1/|Ω| that λ∗≤max{γ(x) −β(x) : x ∈Ω} for all
dI > 0. By part (a), λ∗is uniformly bounded for dI ≥1. Thus, it has a ﬁnite limit ˆλ as
dI →∞. We divide both sides of (2.2) by dI to get
∆ψ∗+ β −γ + λ∗
By elliptic regularity , ψ∗→¯ψ in C(Ω) as dI →∞for some
positive constant ¯ψ. We integrate (2.2) by parts over Ωto get
Ω(β −γ)ψ∗+ λ∗R
Letting dI →∞produces the desired relation ˆλ =
Stability of the DFE and properties of R0
Applying Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2, and the linear eigenvalue problem just described, we can deﬁne
a basic reproduction number R0 for the system (1.1) using the next generation approach for
heterogenous populations . It is known
in non-spatial models and in patch models that if R0 < 1
then the DFE is locally asymptotically stable, and if R0 > 1 then the DFE is unstable. We now
extend this theory to our reaction-diﬀusion model.
Lemma 2.3. Deﬁne the basic reproduction number R0 for (1.1) by
ΩdI|∇ϕ|2 + γϕ2
(a) R0 is a positive and monotone decreasing function of dI > 0;
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
(b) R0 →max{β(x)/γ(x) : x ∈Ω} as dI →0;
Ωγ as dI →∞;
(d) R0 > 1 when λ∗< 0, R0 = 1 when λ∗= 0, and R0 < 1 when λ∗> 0.
Proof. The right-hand side of (2.5) exists and is positive because the functions β and γ are positive
on Ω. The rest of part (a) is clear by inspection of (2.5). The proof for part (b) is similar to
that of Lemma 3.1 , and the argument for part (c) is similar to the one
given in Lemma 2.2 (c). It remains to establish part (d). It is a well-known fact that there exists
a positive function Φ(x) ∈C2(Ω) such that
−dI∆Φ + γΦ = β
Φ for x ∈Ω
∂n = 0 for x ∈∂Ω.
Now consider (2.2) and (2.6),
dI∆ψ∗+ (β −γ)ψ∗+ λ∗ψ∗= 0,
dI∆Φ −γΦ + β
Recall that ψ∗and Φ are both positive on Ωand that ∂ψ∗/∂n = ∂Φ/∂n = 0 on ∂Ω. We multiply
(2.7) by Φ and (2.8) by ψ∗, integrate by parts on Ω, and subtract the resulting equations to obtain
Ωψ∗Φ are both positive, we conclude that 1 −(1/R0) and λ∗have opposite
signs. That is, R0 > 1 when λ∗< 0, R0 = 1 when λ∗= 0, and R0 < 1 when λ∗> 0.
We now show that the stability of the DFE is determined entirely by the magnitude of R0.
Lemma 2.4. If R0 < 1 then the DFE is stable, but if R0 > 1 then it is unstable.
(a) Suppose ﬁrst that R0 < 1. We will show that the DFE is linearly stable, that is, if (λ, φ, ψ)
is any solution of (2.1), with at least one of φ or ψ not identically zero on Ω, then Re(λ)
must be positive. We argue by contradiction. Suppose that (λ, φ, ψ) is a solution of (2.1),
with at least one of φ or ψ not identically zero, and that Re(λ) ≤0. We ﬁrst show that
ψ ̸≡0 on Ω. For suppose otherwise. Then φ ̸≡0 on Ω. Furthermore, (2.1a) with ψ ≡0 and
(2.1c) imply that
dS∆φ + λφ = 0 for x ∈Ω
∂n = 0 for x ∈∂Ω.
This equation implies that λ is real and nonnegative, and therefore that λ = 0. We conclude
from the maximum principle that φ takes a constant value, say φ0, on Ω. It follows from
(2.1d) with ψ ≡0 that φ0 = 0. But this implies that φ ≡0 on Ω, a contradiction. We
conclude then that ψ ̸≡0 on Ω. Thus, λ must be real and nonpositive in (2.1b) because
dI∆+ β −γ is a self-adjoint operator. It follows from this and the minimality of λ∗that
λ∗≤λ ≤0. Lemma 2.3 (d) implies that R0 ≥1, a contradiction. We conclude that if
(λ, φ, ψ) is a solution of (2.1), with at least one of φ or ψ not identically zero on Ω, then
Re(λ) > 0. This proves linear stability of the DFE. Stability of the DFE follows from its
linear stability .
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
(b) Suppose now that R0 > 1. We will show that the DFE is linearly unstable. In fact, we
will establish that there exists a solution (λ, φ, ψ) of (2.1) with Re(λ) < 0 and ψ > 0 on Ω.
Recall that (λ∗, ψ∗) satisﬁes (2.2) and that we may take ψ∗> 0 on Ω. Lemma 2.3 (d) implies
that λ∗< 0. Hence, the inhomogeneous linear equation (2.1a) with (λ, ψ) = (λ∗, ψ∗), i.e.,
dS∆φ + λ∗φ = (β −γ)ψ∗,
has a unique solution φ∗satisfying ∂φ∗/∂n = 0 for x ∈∂Ω .
Finally, we add (2.9) with φ = φ∗to (2.2) and then integrate by parts over Ωto get
Ω(φ∗+ ψ∗) = 0. Since λ∗is negative, we conclude that
Ω(φ∗+ ψ∗) = 0. Thus, (2.1)
has a solution (λ∗, φ∗, ψ∗) satisfying λ∗< 0 and ψ∗> 0 on Ω. Hence, the DFE is linearly
unstable. Instability of the DFE follows from its linear instability .
We now show that if R0 < 1 then the disease always becomes extinct, i.e., the DFE is globally
asymptotically stable.
Lemma 2.5. If R0 < 1 then ( ¯S, ¯I) →( ˆS, 0) in C(Ω) as t →∞.
Proof. Suppose that R0 < 1. We will use the comparison principle to show that ¯I(x, t) →0 as
t →∞for every x ∈Ω. To begin, observe from (1.1b) that
∂t ≤dI∆¯I + (β −γ)¯I,
x ∈Ωand t > 0.
Next, let us deﬁne u(x, t) = Me−λ∗tψ∗(x) where λ∗> 0 by Lemma 2.3(d), ψ∗> 0 on Ω, and M
is chosen so large that ¯I(x, 0) ≤u(x, 0) for every x ∈Ω. It can be easily shown, by making use of
(2.2), that u satisﬁes
∂t = dI∆u + (β −γ)u,
x ∈Ωand t > 0
and ∂u/∂n = 0 for x ∈∂Ωand t > 0. By the comparison principle, ¯I(x, t) ≤u(x, t) for every
x ∈Ωand t ≥0. Since u(x, t) →0 as t →∞for every x ∈Ω, we also have that ¯I(x, t) →0 as
t →∞for every x ∈Ω.
We now show that ¯S tends to ˆS as t →∞. Observe from (1.1a) that
∂t −dS∆¯S =
x ∈Ωand t > 0.
The continuity of β and γ on Ω, together with the preceding remarks about ¯I(x, t) and u(x, t),
imply that
x ∈Ωand t > 0,
for some positive constant C1. Since the right-hand side tends to 0 exponentially, it follows that
¯S(x, t) tends to a positive constant as t →∞.
To see this, write ¯S(x, t) = S1(t) + S2(x, t),
where S1(t) =
Ω¯S(x, t) dx. Observe that |∂S1/∂t| ≤C2e−λ∗t for some positive constant C2.
Therefore, S2 satisﬁes ∂S2/∂t = dS∆S2 + f(x, t) on Ω× (0, ∞) with |f(x, t)| ≤C3e−λ∗t for some
positive constant C3, ∂S2/∂n = 0 on ∂Ω× (0, ∞), and
ΩS2(x, t) dx ≡0 for every t ≥0. By (1.3)
and ¯I(x, t) →0 as t →∞, we have S1(t) →ˆS as t →∞. Let 0 = λ0 < λ1 ≤λ2 ≤· · · denote
the eigenvalues of −∆with zero Neumann boundary condition, and {ϕk}∞
k=0 be corresponding
normalized eigenfunctions.
Set S2 = P∞
k=0 ak(t)ϕk(x) and f = P∞
k=0 fk(t)ϕk(x).
a0 = f0 = 0 as
ΩS2(x, t) dx ≡0. Since |fk(t)| ≤C4e−λ∗t for every k ≥1, we see that |ak(t)| ≤
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
C5e−λ∗∗t for every k ≥1, where C4 and C5 are positive constants and λ∗∗= min{λ∗, λ1} > 0.
Hence, S2(x, t) →0 for x ∈Ωas t →∞for every x ∈Ω. We conclude that ¯S(x, t) →ˆS as t →∞
for every x ∈Ω.
The global asymptotic stability of the DFE when R0 < 1 implies that there can be no EE in
this case. In Sect. 3, we consider what happens when R0 > 1.
The Endemic Equilibrium
Throughout this section, we again assume that (A1) and (A2) hold and that N is ﬁxed. Theorem
3 follows from Lemma 3.4.
Equivalent problems
We will consider several alternative statements of the equilibrium problem. The ﬁrst such statement is as follows.
Lemma 3.1. The pair ( ˜S, ˜I) is a solution of (1.4) if and only if ( ˜S, ˜I) is a solution of
κ = dS ˜S + dI ˜I,
0 = dI∆˜I + ˜I
( ˜S + ˜I),
where κ is some positive constant that is independent of x ∈Ω.
(a) Suppose ﬁrst that ( ˜S, ˜I) is a solution of (1.4). Eqs. (1.4a)–(1.4c) imply that
 dS ˜S + dI ˜I
= 0 for x ∈Ω
 dS ˜S + dI ˜I
= 0 for x ∈∂Ω.
By the maximum principle, dS ˜S + dI ˜I = κ on Ωfor some constant κ. Since ˜S, ˜I ≥0 on Ω
and N > 0, it must be that dS ˜S + dI ˜I > 0 for some x ∈Ω. Therefore, κ > 0. The fact that
( ˜S, ˜I) satisﬁes (3.1b)–(3.1d) is clear by inspection.
(b) Suppose now that ( ˜S, ˜I) is a solution of (3.1) for some κ > 0. To see that ( ˜S, ˜I) satisﬁes
(1.4a), observe from (3.1a) and (3.1b) that if x ∈Ωthen
dS∆˜S = −dI∆˜I = ˜I
Thus, (1.4a) is satisﬁed. The fact that ( ˜S, ˜I) satisﬁes (1.4b)–(1.4d) is clear by inspection.
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
For our second equivalent formulation, let
= dI ˜I(x)
where κ is as in Lemma 3.1, and let
f(x, u) def
dI + (dS −dI)u
x ∈Ωand u ∈ .
Observe that f strictly decreases from β(x) −γ(x) to −γ(x) as u increases from 0 to 1. The next
result follows from a direct calculation.
Lemma 3.2. The pair ( ˜S, ˜I) is a solution of (3.1) if and only if (S, I) is a solution of
1 = dSS + I,
0 = dI∆I + If(x, I),
Existence and uniqueness of the EE
Lemma 3.3. Suppose that R0 > 1. Then (3.4) has a nonnegative solution (S, I) which satisﬁes
S(x), I(x) ∈C2(Ω) and I ̸≡0 on Ω. Furthermore, this solution with I ̸≡0 is unique, S(x) > 0,
and 0 < I(x) < 1 for x ∈Ω.
Proof. In view of (3.4b) and (3.4c), consider the boundary value problem
= dI∆I + If(x, I) = 0 for x ∈Ω
∂n = 0 for x ∈∂Ω.
If I and I is a sub-solution and super-solution of (3.5), respectively, i.e., G(I) ≥0 ≥G(I) on Ω
and ∂I/∂n = ∂I/∂n = 0 on ∂Ω, and they are ordered, i.e., I ≤I on Ω, then there must exist some
I ∈[I, I] satisfying (3.5), where [I, I] def
= {I ∈C2(Ω) : I(x) ≤I(x) ≤I(x) for x ∈Ω} (Smoller
Recall that (λ∗, ψ∗) satisﬁes (2.2) and that ψ∗> 0 on Ω. We now show that I = ϵψ∗and
I ≡1 are sub- and super-solutions for (3.5) if ϵ is chosen to be positive and suﬃciently small.
Lemma 2.3(d) implies that λ∗< 0. In view of (3.3), deﬁne
dI + (dS −dI)u,
u ∈ .
We remark that g increases from 0 to 1 as u increases from 0 to 1. Observe from (3.3) and (2.2)
G(I) = dI∆(ϵψ∗) + ϵψ∗f(x, ϵψ∗)
= ϵ [dI∆ψ∗+ ψ∗(β −γ) −βψ∗g(ϵψ∗)]
= ϵψ∗[−λ∗−βg(ϵψ∗)]
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
is positive for x ∈Ωwhen 0 < ϵ ≪1. Also, ∂I/∂n = 0 on ∂Ωby (2.2). Therefore, I is a
sub-solution of (3.5) for ϵ positive and suﬃciently small. Next, since G(I) = f(x, 1) = −γ(x) is
negative on Ω, and ∂I/∂n = 0 on ∂Ω, it follows that I is a super-solution of (3.5). Also, it is
obvious that I ≤I on Ωif ϵ is chosen suﬃciently small. We conclude from the remarks above that
there must be an I ∈[I, I] satisfying (3.5). That is, there exists some I(x) ∈C2(Ω) satisfying
(3.4b) and (3.4c) with 0 < I(x) ≤1 for x ∈Ω. We argue by contradiction to show that I is strictly
less than 1 on Ω. Suppose that I(x) = 1 for some x ∈Ω. As I achieves its maximum on Ωat x, it
must be that ∆I(x) ≤0. But then G(I(x)) = dI∆I(x) −γ(x) < 0, a contradiction. We conclude
that 0 < I(x) < 1 for every x ∈Ω. In view of (3.4a), let us deﬁne S by 1 = dSS + I. Then
S(x) ∈C2(Ω) and S > 0 on Ω. Thus, (S, I) is a positive solution of (3.4) with I(x), S(x) ∈C2(Ω)
and I(x) < 1 for x ∈Ω.
To show uniqueness, we argue by contradiction.
Suppose that (3.4) has two nonnegative
solutions (S1, I1) and (S2, I2) with I1, I2 ̸≡0 and I1 ̸≡I2 on Ω.
It follows from (3.4a) that
0 ≤I1, I2 ≤1 on Ω. From the maximum principle, we obtain that 0 < I1, I2 ≤1 on Ω. Therefore,
we may choose ϵ small enough so that I ≤I1, I2 ≤I on Ω. Let Im and Im denote the minimal and
maximal solutions of (3.4b) and (3.4c), respectively, within the set [I, I]. Since I1 ̸≡I2, we have
Im ≤Im and Im ̸≡Im. The maximum principle now implies that Im < Im on Ω. Multiplying
(3.4b) with I = Im by Im and (3.4b) with I = Im by Im, subtracting the resulting equations, and
then integrating by parts over Ωgives
f(x, Im) −f(x, Im)
The fact that ∂f/∂u < 0 for x ∈Ωand u ∈ implies that f(x, Im) −f(x, Im) > 0 on Ω. But
this result contradicts (3.6) because Im and Im are both positive functions. We conclude that
(3.4) has a unique nonnegative solution (S, I) with I ̸≡0 on Ω.
The next result follows from Lemmas 3.1–3.3 and (3.2).
Lemma 3.4. Suppose that R0 > 1. Then (1.4) has a nonnegative solution ( ˜S, ˜I) which satisﬁes
˜S(x), ˜I(x) ∈C2(Ω) and ˜I ̸≡0 on Ω. Furthermore, this solution is unique, it is given by ( ˜S, ˜I) =
(κS, κI/dI) where κ is as in (3.4d), and both ˜S and ˜I are positive on Ω.
We have shown that a unique EE exists when R0 > 1 and that both ˜S and ˜I are positive. In
the next section, we consider the asymptotic behavior of the EE as dS →0.
Asymptotic Behavior of the Endemic Equilibrium
Throughout this section, we still assume that (A1) and (A2) hold and that N is ﬁxed. We also
assume that R0 > 1, so that Lemma 3.3 for (S, I) and Lemma 3.4 for ( ˜S, ˜I) always apply. Theorem
4 is a combination of Lemmas 4.2–4.7 and Lemma 4.9.
The limiting DFE
Observe that ˜S, ˜I, and κ are all functions of dS in (1.4) and (3.1). To determine their behavior
as dS →0, we must ﬁrst establish some asymptotic properties of I in (3.2).
Lemma 4.1. I is a monotone decreasing function of dS.
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
Proof. Suppose that 0 < dS1 < dS2 and let I1 and I2 be corresponding solutions to (3.4b) and
(3.4c) with 0 < I1, I2 < 1 on Ω. Then
dI∆I1 + I1f(x, I1, dS1) = 0 for x ∈Ω
∂n = 0 for x ∈∂Ω,
dI∆I2 + I2f(x, I2, dS2) = 0 for x ∈Ω
∂n = 0 for x ∈∂Ω,
f(x, u, dS) = β(x)
dSu + dI(1 −u)
x ∈Ωand u ∈ .
It is easy to see that ∂f/∂dS ≤0. It follows from this fact and (4.1b) with dS1 in place of dS2
dI∆I2 + I2f(x, I2, dS1) ≥0 for x ∈Ω
∂n = 0 for x ∈∂Ω.
Thus, I2 is a sub-solution of (4.1a). Again, I ≡1 on Ωis a super-solution of (4.1a). Also, I2 < I
on Ω. By the sub-solution and super-solution method, (4.1a) has a unique solution I1 ∈[I2, I].
We conclude that I1 ≥I2 on Ω.
Lemma 4.2. I →I∗in C1(Ω) as dS →0 for some I∗(x) ∈C1(Ω) with 0 < I∗(x) ≤1 on Ωand
∂I∗/∂n = 0 on ∂Ω.
Proof. Recall from Lemma 3.3 that 0 < I(x) < 1 for x ∈Ω. It follows from Lemma 4.1 that
exists for every x ∈Ωand that 0 < I∗(x) ≤1 for x ∈Ω. Since I and f(x, I) are uniformly
bounded for all dS > 0, it follows from (3.4b) and Lp-estimates that ∥I∥W 2,p(Ω) is bounded for
every dS > 0 and p > 1 . Consequently, ∥I∥C1,α(Ω) is bounded for
every dS > 0 and α ∈(0, 1) by the Sobolev embedding theorem .
Passing to a subsequence if necessary, we obtain that I →I∗in C1(Ω) as dS →0. We see from
(4.2) that this property holds for the whole sequence. The fact that ∂I∗/∂n = 0 on ∂Ωfollows
from ∂I/∂n = 0 on ∂Ωfor every dS > 0 and I →I∗in C1(Ω) as dS →0.
It remains to determine where 0 < I∗< 1 and where I∗= 1 on Ω. Let
J−= {x ∈Ω: 0 < I∗(x) < 1}
J+ = {x ∈Ω: I∗(x) = 1}.
Observe that J−∪J+ = Ω. It turns out that J−and J+ are both nonempty. We ﬁrst show this
for J−by demonstrating that it contains H−and therefore has positive measure.
Lemma 4.3. H−⊆J−.
Proof. We argue by contradiction. Suppose that there exists some x0 ∈H−such that x0 /∈J−,
i.e., I∗(x0) = 1. We see from (3.4b) and the properties of f that ∆I(x) > 0 for all x ∈H−.
Hence, there exists some τ > 0 such that B(x0, τ) ⊂H−and
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
where B = B(x0, τ). We let dS →0 and apply Lemma 4.2 to get
Since I∗(x0) = 1 and I∗(x) ≤1 on B, it follows that I∗≡1 on B.
We now choose some
0 (B) such that ϕ ≥0 on B, ∂ϕ/∂n = 0 on ∂B, and ϕ(x) > 0 for some x ∈B. Multiplying
(3.4b) by ϕ, integrating over B, and making use of the properties of f, we obtain
I(β −γ)ϕ ≥0.
We integrate by parts to get
I(β −γ)ϕ ≥0.
Since I →I∗≡1 on B as dS →0, and
B ∆ϕ = 0, we must have that
(β −γ)ϕ ≥0.
But this is a contradiction because β −γ < 0 on B, ϕ ≥0 on B, and ϕ(x) > 0 for some x ∈B.
We now determine the asymptotic behavior of κ and ˜I.
Lemma 4.4. As dS →0, κ →0 and ˜I →0.
Proof. We ﬁrst show that κ →0 as dS →0. By (1.4d), the positivity of ˜I on Ω, (3.1a), and (3.2)
( ˜S + ˜I) >
It follows from Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3 that
H−(1 −I∗) > 0.
This inequality and Lemma 4.2 again implies that if dS is suﬃciently small then
As the right-hand side is constant, we conclude that κ →0 as dS →0. It now follows from (3.1a)
and the positivity of ˜S and ˜I on Ωthat ˜I →0 as dS →0.
We are now in a position to determine the asymptotic behavior of ˜S.
Lemma 4.5. The following statements hold:
(a) κ/dS →N∗def
Ω(1 −I∗) as dS →0;
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
(b) ˜S →S∗def
= (1 −I∗)N∗in C1(Ω) as dS →0;
(c) S∗≥0 on Ω, ∂S∗/∂n = 0 on ∂Ω, and
(a) Eqs. (3.1a), (3.1d), and (3.2) imply that
Lemmas 4.2 and 4.4 imply that
This limit is well-deﬁned because J−has positive measure.
(b) Again, (3.1a) and (3.2) imply that
˜S = κ −dI ˜I
= (1 −I) κ
Lemma 4.2 and part (a) imply that ˜S →(1 −I∗)N∗in C1(Ω) as dS →0.
(c) This part follows immediately from parts (a) and (b), the positivity of N, and Lemma
Properties of the set J+
Observe from (4.3) and Lemma 4.5 (b) that S∗= 0 on J+.
Lemma 4.6. The set J+ is nonempty and has positive measure.
Proof. We argue by contradiction.
Suppose that J+ is empty or has measure zero, i.e., 0 <
I∗(x) < 1 a.e. on Ω. We multiply both sides of (3.1b) by dI/κ and make use of (3.2) to get
Since I →I∗on Ωas dS →0, and I∗∈(0, 1) a.e. on Ω, we have from (3.4a) that
Hence, by (3.2),
Letting dS →0 in (4.4), we see from Lemma 4.2 that I∗is an H1 weak solution of
dI∆I∗+ I∗(β −γ) = 0 for x ∈Ω
∂n = 0 for x ∈∂Ω.
By elliptic regularity, the weak solution I∗is a classical solution, that is, I∗∈C2(Ω). We conclude
that (λ, φ) = (0, I∗) is a solution of (2.1b). Since I∗> 0 on Ω, it must be that λ∗= 0. But this
contradicts Lemma 2.3 (d) with R0 > 1. Hence, J+ is nonempty and has positive measure.
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
Properties of the set J−
Lemma 4.7. Suppose that (A3) holds. Then the following statements hold:
(a) H−⊆J−;
(b) J−\ H−is nonempty, open, and has positive measure;
(c) I∗(x) ∈C2(J−) and dI∆I∗+ I∗(β −γ) = 0 for x ∈J−.
(a) We argue by contradiction. Suppose that J−does not contain H−. By Lemma 4.3, it must
be that J−does not contain ∂H−. Thus, there exists some x0 ∈∂H−such that x0 /∈J−,
i.e., I∗(x0) = 1. Observe that I∗attains its maximum on Ωat x0. If x0 ∈∂Ωthen the Hopf
Boundary Lemma implies that
∂n (x0) > 0,
with n being the outward unit normal vector on ∂Ω. But this inequality contradicts Lemma
4.2. We conclude that x0 /∈∂Ω, and that instead x0 ∈Ω. As Ωis open, it must be that
∇I∗(x0) = 0. Since H−⊆J−, it follows from an argument similar to the one given in the
proof of Lemma 4.6 that I∗(x) ∈C2(H−) and that dI∆I∗+ I∗(β −γ) = 0 for x ∈H−.
Lemma 4.3 implies that I∗(x) ∈(0, 1) for every x ∈H−, and therefore that ∆I∗> 0 on
H−. With n now as the outward unit normal vector on ∂H−, the Hopf Boundary Lemma
implies that
∂n (x0) > 0,
which is again a contradiction. We conclude that H−⊆J−.
(b) Since J−is an open set (it is the inverse image of an open interval) and H−is closed, we
see that J−\ H−is nonempty, open, and has positive measure.
(c) By an argument similar to the one in Lemma 4.6, we see that I∗is an H1 weak solution of
dI∆I∗+ I∗(β −γ) = 0 for x ∈J−. By elliptic regularity, the weak solution I∗is a classical
solution, that is, I∗∈C2(J−). This completes the proof.
For δ > 0, let H+
= {x ∈H+ : β(x) −γ(x) > δ}, let Kδ denote any connected component
of the open set H+
δ ∩J−, and let λ∗
δ denote the smallest eigenvalue of −∆with zero Dirichlet
boundary condition on Kδ.
Lemma 4.8. Suppose that (A3) holds. Then λ∗
δ ≥δ/dI for every δ > 0.
Proof. We argue by contradiction.
Suppose that λ∗
δ < δ/dI for some δ > 0.
Let Iδ be an
eigenfunction of λ∗
δ chosen in such a way that 0 < Iδ(x) ≤I∗(x) for every x ∈Ω. Then −∆Iδ =
δIδ < (δ/dI)Iδ for x ∈Kδ and Iδ = 0 for x ∈∂Kδ. Lemma 4.7 (c) implies that −dI∆I∗=
(β −γ)I∗≥δI∗for x ∈Kδ and I∗≥0 for x ∈∂Kδ.
Therefore, Iδ and I∗are sub- and
super-solutions, respectively, of the boundary value problem
ϕ for x ∈Kδ
ϕ = 0 for x ∈∂Kδ.
Also, Iδ ≤I∗on Kδ. By the sub-solution and super-solution method we see that (4.5) has a
solution ϕ satisfying 0 < Iδ ≤ϕ ≤I∗on Kδ. This implies that λ∗
δ = δ/dI, which contradicts our
assumption that λ∗
δ < δ/dI. We conclude that λ∗
δ ≥δ/dI for every δ > 0.
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
Lemma 4.9. Suppose that (A3) holds and m = 1. Then |J−\ H−| →0 as dI →0.
Proof. Let ϵ > 0. By assumption (A3), the set H◦is a union of ﬁnitely many points. Hence,
there exists δ∗> 0 such that the set Mδ
= H◦∪(H+ \ H+
δ ) = {x ∈Ω: 0 ≤β(x) −γ(x) ≤δ}
satisﬁes |Mδ| < ϵ whenever 0 < δ ≤δ∗. Also, (A3) implies that the open set H−is a union of
ﬁnitely many disjoint open intervals, i.e, H−= Sr
j=1(αj, βj), where r denotes the total number
of intervals.
We now show that J−is also a union of at most r disjoint open intervals. Since J−is open,
it is a union of countably many disjoint open intervals, i.e, J−= S∞
k=1(ak, bk).
Recall from
Lemma 4.7 (a) that J−contains H−= Sr
j=1[αj, βj]. Since an interval is connected, every [αj, βj]
is contained in some (ak, bk). We claim that every (ak, bk) contains some [αj, βj]. For suppose
otherwise. Then there exists some (al, bl) which does not contain any [αj, βj]. Since every [αj, βj]
is contained in some (ak, bk), it must be that (al, bl) lies entirely outside of H−, i.e., (al, bl) ⊆H+.
Integrating the equation for I∗in Lemma 4.7 (c) over (al, bl), and using the fact that the derivative
of I∗vanishes at al and bl, we obtain
al (β −γ)I∗= 0. But this contradicts β > γ and I∗> 0
on (al, bl) ⊆H+. We conclude that every (ak, bk) contains some [αj, βj]. Since there are only r
intervals of the form [αj, βj], we conclude that there are at most r intervals of the form (ak, bk).
That is, J−is a union of at most r disjoint open intervals.
By (A3), there exists δ∗∗such that if 0 < δ ≤δ∗∗then the open set Ωδ
also a union of ﬁnitely many disjoint open intervals, i.e., Ωδ = Ss
k=1(ck, dk), with s ≤2r. Let
k denotes the smallest eigenvalue of −∆subject to zero Dirichlet boundary conditions on the
interval (ck, dk). By the comparison principle for eigenvalues and Lemma 4.8, µ∗
δ ≥δ/dI for
every k. Therefore,
(dk −ck) ≤sπ
Since r is independent of dI, we have |Ωδ| ≤ϵ for 0 < δ ≤δ∗∗and 0 < dI ≪1. Therefore,
|J−\ H−| = |J−∩H+| = |J−∩(Mδ ∪H+
δ )| ≤|Mδ| + |Ωδ| ≤2ϵ for 0 < δ ≤min{δ∗, δ∗∗} and dI
suﬃciently small.
Discussion
Connections to a related patch model
Many of these results agree with those obtained in our paper on discrete patch SIS-model . The model studied here, with a continuous spatial habitat, can be viewed as consisting
of inﬁnitely many discrete patches. Theorems 1 to 4 are concerned mainly with the eﬀect of
the spatial heterogeneity of the environment and the diﬀerence in movement of susceptible and
infected individuals on disease persistence and extinction. Similar questions are addressed in Allen
et al. and most of the results in this paper have analogues in Allen at al. , although
the techniques are rather diﬀerent. Furthermore, the two papers provide ideas and intuitions for
each other. In particular, in both papers it is shown that when the disease-free equilibrium is
stable (R0 < 1), then it is globally asymptotically stable; and when it is unstable (R0 > 1), then
there exists a unique endemic equilibrium. A surprising result is also established in both papers:
as dS →0, the disease cannot persist (i.e., ˜I →0) while ˜S converges to some S∗which must be
positive at all low-risk sites. However, for high-risk sites, there is a big diﬀerence: for the patch
model in Allen at al. , S∗can be zero on all high-risk sites, while for the PDE model S∗
must be positive at some high-risk sites. However, if dI is suﬃciently small, the two papers have
Allen et al. - SIS epidemic reaction-diﬀusion model
some similar results (again proved by completely diﬀerent techniques): for the patch model, S∗
is equal to zero on all high-risk patches if dI is small; for the PDE model, as dI →0, the measure
of the set J−\ H−(i.e., where S∗is positive on H+) tends to 0.
Open Questions
We conjecture that for each ﬁxed N, the unique EE from Theorem 3 is globally asymptotically
stable among all initial data satisfying (1.2). While this result is diﬃcult to prove, the following
problems are more approachable.
(i) Local stability of EE when dS is suﬃciently small. The results in Theorem 4 provide the
asymptotic proﬁle of the EE and such information is likely to be useful in establishing the
linear stability of the EE, but a much better understanding of the free boundary problem
as described in the Introduction seems to be needed.
(ii) Clearly, the global attractivity of the unique EE and Theorem 4 will imply that for any
ϵ > 0, there exists d∗
S > 0 such that if dS < d∗
S, then lim supt→∞¯I(x, t) ≤ϵ for every x ∈Ω.
A direct proof of this result without invoking the global asymptotic stability of the unique
EE would be very interesting.
