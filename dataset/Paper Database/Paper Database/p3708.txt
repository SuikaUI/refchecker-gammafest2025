This article investigates inconsistency and invalid statistical inference that often characterize dynamic panel
analysis in international political economy. These econometric concerns are tied to Nickell bias and
cross-sectional dependence. First, we discuss how to avoid Nickell bias in dynamic panels. Second, we
put forward factor-augmented dynamic panel regression as a means for addressing cross-sectional
dependence. As a specific application, we use our methods for an analysis of the impact of terrorism on
economic growth. Different terrorism variables are shown to have no influence on economic growth for five
regional samples when Nickell bias and cross-dependence are taken into account. Our finding about
terrorism and growth is contrary to the extant literature.
Introduction
Dynamic panel analysis is a prevalent methodology in international relations, international
political economy, and other areas of political science. For example, dynamic panel analysis are
used to discern the impact of globalization on transnational terrorism , the
eﬀect of government ideology on military spending , the inﬂuence
of a dominant state on the military burdens of subordinate states , the diﬀusion of
democracy to neighboring states , the eﬀects of globalization on the
welfare state , or the determinants of militarized interstate disputes
 . These and many other applications in international political
economy are investigated with time-series, cross-sectional panels with a lagged dependent variable.
Another recent example includes an analysis of the eﬀects of terrorism on economic growth
 .
Surely, the application of dynamic panel will grow in importance, because relationships involving
the dependent variable and its past values are relevant when analyzing investment behavior (e.g.,
foreign direct investment), ﬁnancial crises, bilateral trade, and conﬂict.

Dynamic panel analysis often suﬀers from two econometric concerns—inconsistency and invalid
statistical inference. These concerns are tied to Nickell bias, which arises from dynamic
models with ﬁxed eﬀects. In addition, these issues may stem from cross-sectional dependence,
where cross-country observations are inﬂuenced by common considerations. This dependence
may arise because countries respond to similar political, economic, or spatial stimuli. For
instance, transnational terrorism is shown to display considerable cross-country dependence presumably because of terrorist networks, common terrorist training camps, common grievances, and
demonstration eﬀects . This means that dynamic panels with
transnational terrorism as an independent variable must correct for this dependence for proper
statistical inference. Cross-sectional dependence is apt to aﬀect other variables, such as democracy,
threat, military spending, and ﬁnancial measures. Nevertheless, dynamic panel studies have not
properly accounted for cross-sectional dependence.
The primary purpose of this article is to present procedures for correcting for Nickell bias and
cross-sectional dependence in dynamic panels. For Nickell bias, we highlight its implications and
how to avoid its consequences. For cross-sectional dependence, we put forward factor-augmented
regressions as a method for accounting for this dependence. Our secondary purpose is to apply
our methods and, in particular, factor-augmented regression to re-evaluate the impact of terrorism
on economic growth. Although the literature found a negative and signiﬁcant impact, we show
that, when Nickell bias and cross-sectional dependence are addressed, terrorism has no inﬂuence
whatsoever on economic growth for ﬁve regional subsamples. This includes a Western European
subsample that previously was shown by Gaibulloev and Sandler to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect
when cross-sectional dependence had not been addressed.
The remainder of the article contains three main sections. Section 2 discusses the methodological
issues associated with dynamic panels, and indicates ways to address Nickell bias and crosssectional dependence. In the latter case, the method of factor-augmented regression is indicated.
In Section 3, we present the application of our methodology to the analysis of the impact of
terrorism on economic growth. Section 4 contains concluding remarks.
Nickell Bias and Cross-Sectional Dependence
Dynamic panel regressions have two thorny statistical problems: Nickell bias and cross-sectional
dependence. We provide a short review of these two problems and oﬀer some solutions.
Inconsistency and Invalid Statistical Inference Due to Nickell Bias and Cross-Sectional
Dependence
Consider the following dynamic panel regression:
yit ¼ ai þ t þ yit1 þ Xitb þ uit,
where yit is the dependent variable for the ith cross-sectional unit at time t;  is the coeﬃcient on
the lagged dependent variable; Xit is a vector of exogenous variables for the ith cross-sectional unit
at time t; b is the vector of coeﬃcients for the exogenous variables; ai is an individual dummy to
eliminate ﬁxed eﬀects; and t is a time dummy to control for cross-sectional dependence in the
regression error, uit.
First, we consider the econometric consequences of Nickell bias. It is well established that the
ﬁxed-eﬀects estimator in equation (1) is inconsistent as N ! 1 for any ﬁxed T . The
inconsistency occurs because the within-group (WG) transformed regressors become correlated
with the WG transformed regression errors. To highlight Nickell bias, we rewrite equation (1)
for the time being without the exogenous variables Xit and t. Further, we assume that yit is not
cross-sectionally dependent; that is,
yit ¼ ai þ yit1 þ eit, eit  iid 0,2
The least squares estimator in equation (2) is the WG estimator, which is also called the ﬁxedeﬀects (FE) estimator, or the least squares dummy variables (LSDV) estimator. Nickell

showed that as N ! 1, the WG estimator in equation (2) is inconsistent. The formula for this
inconsistency is given by
plimN!1 ^  
Þ ¼  1 þ 
(see Appendix A1 for details). At this point, readers may conclude that Nickell bias disappears as
T ! 1, or can be resolved by including a larger time-series sample. For example, let T ¼ 10 and
 ¼ 0.8. The empirical distribution of the WG estimator ^ then moves to the left by 1.8/10 ¼ 0.18.
On average, the WG point estimate becomes 0.62 rather than 0.8. When T ¼ 30, the magnitude of
the bias decreases from 0.18 to 1.8/30 ¼ 0.06. For a panel with a large T, the Nickell bias problem
is thus less of an issue in terms of inconsistency. However, even with a large T, Nickell bias is still
a serious concern because the usual t-statistic remains invalid as long as T < N: Alvarez and
Arellano showed that as N,T ! 1 jointly but N=T ! 1, the ordinary t-statistics for
^ grows larger in absolute value (see Appendix A1 for details). In other words, when the total
number of cross-sectional units (N) is larger than the total number of time-series observations (T),
the standard deviation for ^ becomes smaller than its true value, so that its t-statistic is typically
biased upward in absolute value.1
Nickell bias diﬀers from the typical inconsistency that results from ignoring ﬁxed eﬀects—also
known as unobserved heterogeneity bias—in general panel regressions. Unobserved heterogeneity
bias arises when FE are correlated with the means of the explanatory variables. In this case, the
pooled ordinary least squares (POLS) estimator is inconsistent, but the WG estimator may solve
this inconsistency. However, for dynamic panel regressions, the WG estimator produces Nickell
bias. Alternatively, unobserved heterogeneity bias can be addressed by including the time-series
means of explanatory variables, as suggested by Honda and Arellano . Recently,
Bafumi and Gelman put forward a similar treatment and called it a multilevel modeling.
However, such treatment does not reduce Nickell bias in dynamic panel regressions, because the
inclusion of the time-series mean of the lagged dependent variable can control for the randomeﬀects bias, but, at the same time, this inclusion leads to an additional bias due to the correlation
between the time-series mean and the regression error, which is the source of the Nickell bias. Thus,
the ﬁnal bias formula does not change. We also note that the random-eﬀects estimator is inconsistent in dynamic panel regressions, because ﬁxed eﬀects are always correlated with the lagged
dependent variable. This inconsistency does not disappear even when T goes to inﬁnity.
When the exogenous variables are included in the dynamic panel, the WG estimator for
these variables is also inconsistent. The probability limit of ^b in equation (1) is
plimN!1 ^b  b
¼ plimN!1 ~X0 ~X
1 ~X0 ~y1
plimN!1 ^  
where ~X ¼ ~X1, . . . ,~XN
0, ~Xi ¼ ~Xi1, . . . ,~XiT
0, ~y1 ¼ ~y1,1, . . . ,~yN,1
0, and ~yi,1 ¼ ~yi1, . . . ,~yiT1
The overhead tilde indicates that the variables are transformed into deviations from their timeseries means. Because the sign of plimN!1 ^  
Þ is negative, the direction of this inconsistency
depends on the correlation between yit1 and Xit. If, for example, Xit is negatively correlated with
yit1, then ^b is downwardly biased. So, even when the true b is zero, the expected value of ^b becomes
negative. Moreover, the t-statistic of ^b grows larger in absolute value as N increases with a ﬁxed T,
1To evaluate the upward bias of the t-statistics, we perform Monte Carlo simulation based on the following datagenerating process: yit ¼ ai þ yit1 þ eit, with the variable of interest being xit ¼ bi þ xit1 þ ’yit1 þ it. We set
 ¼ ’ ¼ 0:3,T ¼ 40, and generate all innovations from i.i.d. N(0,1). After generating pseudo xit and yit, we run the
following dynamic panel regression: yit ¼ ai þ yit1 þ xit1 þ eit. The null hypothesis of interest becomes
Regardless of the size of N, the bias of ^ is around –0.01, which can be ignored. However, the rejection rate of the
null hypothesis is dependent on the size of N. When N is 20, the rejection rate is around 0.067, close to the nominal rate
of 0.05. However, as N increases, the false rejection rate also rises. When N ¼ 200, the rejection rate is 0.173, which is
far higher than the nominal rate of 0.05. In other words, if N > T, the null hypothesis is too often rejected even when
the null is true. This is a concern for international political economy applications that sometimes include almost two
hundred countries and many fewer than two hundred periods. See the supplementary appendix on the Political Analysis
Web site for further details of the Monte Carlo study.

so that its t-ratio becomes large enough in absolute value to reject the null hypothesis for N
suﬃciently larger than T: Hence, as the number of cross-sectional units increases, the frequency
of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of b ¼ 0 increases.
Next, we consider the impact of cross-sectional dependence on consistency and statistical inference. We allow for cross-sectional dependence in the regression error in equations (1) and (2). In the
presence of this dependence, the limiting distribution of ^ becomes unknown. As the positive crosssectional correlation with the regression error grows stronger, the true critical value of the ordinary
t-statistic becomes larger in absolute value, so that we do not know the proper critical values.
If, moreover, cross-sectional dependence in the error term is correlated with the regressors,
which may be the case for many practical applications in international political economy, then
the estimated coeﬃcients will be biased and inconsistent. To illustrate, we write the common factor
representation in the regression error as
iFt þ eit,
where Ft is a k  1 vector of unknown common factors and li is a k  1 vector of unknown factor
loadings. Similarly, the regressors Xit have the common factor structure
it ¼ x,iFx,t þ Xo0
it is the idiosyncratic component of Xit. If the common factor from Xit is correlated with the
common factor from uit, then the regressors are no longer exogenous so that the WG estimator
becomes inconsistent. Including the common time eﬀects may reduce the degree of such inconsistency, but does not eliminate it.
Solution for Nickell Bias and Cross-Sectional Dependence
The standard solution for Nickell bias is to use the GMM/IV estimator for a panel when N is large
and T is small. Unfortunately, the GMM/IV method performs poorly when  is near unity because
instrumental variables become very weak. When, however, T is large, Nickell bias is less of a
concern in terms of inconsistency, as shown earlier and recognized by Beck and Katz , but
the problem of the statistical inference still remains if N is relatively larger than T. A simple
practical solution is the use of subgroups—for example, allow the panel to consist of regions
instead of the world. For N ¼ 100 and T ¼ 40, the Nickell bias can be ignored, but the standard
t-statistic becomes invalid since N > T. Suppose that we form ﬁve subgroups so that Nj ¼ 100/5 ¼ 20
for all j, where Nj is the total number of cross-sectional units for the jth subgroup. Then, since
Nj < T, the standard t-statistic becomes valid so that the standard critical value can be used for
Next, we allow for cross-sectional dependence but keep the strong exogeneity assumption. In this
situation, the invalid statistical inference problem due to cross-sectional dependence2 can be
handled by using a sieve bootstrapping method, which pins down the empirical critical values
when T > N: If, however, N > T, the limiting distribution of the resulting estimator is not
pivotal due to Nickell bias, so that the bootstrapping method does not work asymptotically. For
strictly exogenous regressors, the sieve bootstrapping method may provide a good approximation
of the unknown empirical distribution.
Now consider the inconsistency problem due to the correlation between common factors from
the regressors and the regression errors. In this case, all bootstrap methods fail due to inconsistency. Pesaran , Bai , and Greenaway-McGrevy, Han, and Sul provided solution
to this problem by adding common factors to the panel regressions:
yit ¼ ai þ yit1 þ Xitb þ l0
iFt þ eit:
2Beck and Katz recognized the problem of cross-sectional dependence, but do not provide the factor-augmented
regression method to fix the problem.

The regression in equation (7) is called a common correlated regression , or interactive FE regression , or factor-augmented regression , and the associated estimators are called common correlated eﬀects (CCE) estimator,
iterative principal component (IPC) estimator, and projected principal component (PPC) estimator,
respectively.3 Hereafter, we call equation (7) the factor-augmented regression and refer to the
corresponding estimator as PPC.
There are advantages associated with the factor-augmented regression. First, equation (7) nests
equation (1); that is, when the error term is not cross-sectionally dependent, the former reduces to
the latter. Second, there is no need to perform a pre-test for endogeneity between Xit and Ft, since
the factor-augmented regression becomes valid regardless of the correlation between Xit and Ft.
Third, the factor-augmented regression is more eﬃcient than the sieve bootstrapping method, even
when Xit is not correlated with Ft. This follows because by including common factors as additional
regressors, the factor-augmented regression reduces the variance of the WG estimator in equation
(7) and sharpens statistical inference.
Since the components of Ft are not observable, they must be estimated. The estimated common
factors, ^Ft, are used for Ft in equation (7). The CCE estimator uses the cross-sectional averages of
yit, yit1, and Xit as the proxy variables for Ft, whereas both the IPC and PPC estimators use the
principal component estimators for Ft. The IPC estimator calculates the common factor Ft directly
from the WG residuals, ^uit, whereas the PPC estimator computes the common factor indirectly
from the regressors and regressand.
The CCE is very simple but requires the identiﬁcation condition that the number of common
factors is smaller than the number of regressors. Neither the PPC nor the IPC estimator has this
requirement. Since the PPC estimator projects out all common factors from Xit, this estimator is
sometimes less eﬃcient than the IPC estimator. However, the IPC estimator requires the initial
value for ^b and uses the inconsistent WG estimator as the initial value. Even though Bai 
showed that the IPC estimator becomes consistent as N,T ! 1, the IPC estimator may not be
eﬃcient for ﬁnite samples due to the use of the inconsistent WG estimator as the initial value.
Therefore, we combine the merits of the IPC and PPC estimators as GHS suggested. In
the ﬁrst stage, we use the PPC estimator to obtain consistent regression residuals. In the second
stage, we apply the IPC estimator. Asymptotically, this combined estimator shares the same
limiting distribution as the IPC estimator. We call this estimator the modiﬁed PPC estimator
(see Appendix A2 for a more detailed explanation).
Specific Application to the Impact of Terrorism on Economic Growth
In this section, we illustrate our methods and the diﬀerences that they make by considering terrorism as a potential determinant of economic growth. Past studies on this issue have applied
dynamic panel analysis without a concern for Nickell bias or cross-sectional dependence.
Table 1 provides a brief summary of the recent empirical studies of the impact of terrorism on
per-capita income growth. In Table 1, the leftmost column indicates the study; the second column
displays the terrorist data source; the third column denotes the sample; the fourth column depicts
the studies’ time period; the ﬁfth column indicates the type of analysis; the sixth column lists some
key (select) controls other than a measure of terrorism; and the rightmost column highlights the
inﬂuence of various measures of terrorism on per-capita income growth. Two studies—Blomberg,
Hess, and Orphanides and Tavares —used a world sample. The other studies,
including the latter half of Blomberg, Hess, and Orphanides , analyzed regional samples.
All previous studies utilized panel data; three of these studies performed additional cross-sectional
analysis. Blomberg, Hess, and Orphanides and Blomberg, Broussard, and Hess found
a signiﬁcant negative impact of terrorism on per-capita income growth in their cross-sectional
estimates for the world and an African sample, respectively. For their panel estimates,
Blomberg, Hess, and Orphanides found mixed results for their regional samples—for

framework; however, the CCE and IPC estimators are easily extended to this framework.

example, terrorism did not have a signiﬁcant negative impact on growth in the Middle East. Some
studies distinguished between transnational (Trans) and domestic (Dom) terrorism, whereas others
 did not. Studies that relied on terrorism data drawn from International
Terrorism: Attributes of Terrorist Events (ITERATE) used just transnational terrorist events,
since this data set does not include domestic incidents. Most of the previous studies found that
one or more measures of terrorism had a negative and signiﬁcant impact on per-capita income
growth regardless of the choice of empirical speciﬁcations, regions, and types of terrorism.
Gaibulloev and Sandler found a negative and signiﬁcant impact of total and transnational
terrorism on Western European per-capita income growth.
Terrorism comes in two forms. Transnational terrorism occurs when an incident in one country
involves perpetrators, victims, institutions, governments, or citizens of another country. The data
on transnational terrorist events come from ITERATE . Among other variables, ITERATE records the incident’s date and its country location, which we use for the number
of incidents for each country during 1970–2009. For domestic terrorist events, the perpetrators and
victims are all from the host or venue country. We draw our data on domestic terrorism from the
Global Terrorism Database (GTD), maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of
Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism . We identify domestic terrorist incidents
for 1970–2009 by applying a breakdown procedure of GTD incidents into transnational and
domestic attacks, devised by Enders, Sandler, and Gaibulloev . Because we have more con-
ﬁdence in ITERATE’s tally of transnational terrorist events, we rely on ITERATE for runs using
just these attacks. We also use the total number of terrorist incidents, which is the sum of transnational and domestic terrorist incidents obtained from GTD.

per capita real GDP, and population from Penn World Table Version 7.0 . The investment share is converted into 2005 international dollars using per-capita
Our world sample covers ninety-nine countries during 1970–2009. Using World Bank deﬁnitions,
we construct ﬁve regional balanced panel data sets. Appendix B presents the list of sample countries
by regions. The important consideration for choosing a particular country for our sample is data
availability. Our main econometric method—the factor-augmented panel estimator—requires a
balanced panel data set. Therefore, we do not include countries with missing information over the
sample period. We focus at the regional level to ensure that the number of years is suﬃciently larger
than the number of countries, essential for a proper econometric speciﬁcation.
We believe that using regional balanced panel data does not drive the diﬀerences between our
results and those in the literature. First, ﬁve of the six studies, listed in Table 1, performed regional
investigations of the impact of terrorism on economic growth. Each of these ﬁve articles emphasized
the importance of regional analysis in isolating terrorism’s impact on growth because, in part, each
region had unique and essential considerations. Second, we compare the conventional method and
our method using the same regional samples to show that the results still diﬀer and that this diﬀerence is driven by methodology, not by the data. Third, we replicate a speciﬁc study from the literature
to demonstrate the sensitivity of its ﬁndings to ignoring the econometric concerns raised here.
Impact of Nickell Bias on Point Estimates
Previous panel regression studies of terrorism and growth are based on the following augmented
Solow growth regression model:
 ln yit ¼ ai þ ln yit1 þ it þ zitc þ uit,
which can be written as
ln yit ¼ ai þ  ln yit1 þ it þ zitc þ uit,
Khusrav Gaibulloev et al.
 Published online by Cambridge University Press
where  ln yit indicates the ith country’s per-capita real GDP growth rate at time t; ln yit1 is
the log of lagged per-capita income for country i; it denotes the ith country’s terrorist events
at time t; zit is a vector of control variables for country i at time t; and uit is an error term. The
ai is a country-speciﬁc intercept; and  are coeﬃcients for log of lagged per-capita income and
terrorism, respectively; and c is a vector of parameters for the control variables. In equation (9),
For now, we exclude control variables, zit. Section 2 shows that ^ associated with equations (8)
and (9) is inconsistent. This inconsistency is dependent on the true value of  and the correlation
between the lagged dependent variable and regressors (see equation (4)). As  approaches unity,
the inconsistency becomes more serious. A typical solution is to use the GMM/IV method as long
as  is not near unity (Section 2). Christopoulos and Tsionas found that the log of per-capita
GDP follows an I(1) process; hence, we are not able to utilize the GMM/IV approaches to correct
for Nickell bias.
When the dependent and independent variables are I(1), the cointegration approach has been
used . However, Enders and Sandler and Enders,
Sandler, and Gaibulloev found that the number of terrorists attack is stationary, so that
cointegration analysis is not germane for the study of the impact of terrorism on growth. Instead,
we impose a nonstationary restriction of  ¼ 1 on equations (8) and (9), and use the ﬁrst diﬀerence
of the log of per-capita GDP (i.e., economic growth) as the dependent variable. By imposing the
unit root restriction, we avoid Nickell bias.4 Our speciﬁcation is
 ln yit ¼ ai þ it þ t þ uit,
where t is the time FE.
Table 2 shows the empirical results based on equations (8) and (10). We also control for time FE
in equation (8)—see conventional speciﬁcation in Table 2. We consider two measures of terrorism—the total number of terrorist attacks divided either by one thousand or by population—and
perform separate regressions for total (domestic and transnational), domestic, and transnational
terrorism. We report estimates for the whole sample and for the regional subsamples. To the right
of the column for the samples, the ﬁrst three columns of Table 2 report the point estimates of 
in equation (8). The boldface coeﬃcients indicate that they are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero at
the 5% level (see supplementary tables for p-values). Consistent with previous empirical studies
(Table 1), these point estimates are generally negative, including for the regional subsamples.
When per-capita terrorism data are used, the t-statistics become larger in absolute value. The
second three right-hand columns show the point estimates of  in equation (10), and the last
three columns display the diﬀerence between the estimates of  in equations (8) and (10). Since
equation (10) is free of Nickell bias, the diﬀerence between the  coeﬃcients in equations (8)
and (10) represents the Nickell bias in equation (8). Evidently, the unit root restriction usually
produces smaller point estimates of  in absolute value so that the bias is positive in absolute terms.
Moreover, the absolute values of the t-statistics (p-values) become generally smaller (larger); hence,
there are many fewer statistically signiﬁcant cases with the unit root restriction in equation (10)
than in equation (8).
Interestingly, imposing the unit root restriction does not always reduce the point estimates,
because the inclusion of common time eﬀects or time FE does not properly control for crosssectional dependence. With cross-sectional dependence, Phillips and Sul showed that
Nickell bias becomes random even when N is very large. If the time FE properly controlled
for cross-sectional dependence, the point estimate in equation (10) would have always been
smaller than that in equation (8). More important, we cannot rely on the conventional critical
value for the t-statistics (Section 2).
4The log of per-capita GDP has an upward deterministic trend, whereas the terrorism data do not. Therefore,
equation (9) becomes unbalanced. By imposing the unit root restriction, we can avoid the unbalanced regression

Factor-Augmented Approach
Before applying the factor-augmented approach, we address further speciﬁcation issues. First,
per-capita income growth rates are possibly serially correlated. To account for serial correlation,
we include the lagged dependent variable,  ln yit1, as an extra regressor, so that
 ln yit ¼ ai þ  ln yit1 þ it þ uit,
where  stands for the autocorrelation between the GDP growth rates, which is diﬀerent from in
equation (8). The regression model in equation (11) has been widely used in the empirical growth
literature ; however, this speciﬁcation does not reveal the true causal relationship
between past terrorism and current economic growth. In other words, the empirical evidence of
 6¼ 0 does not imply that E it ln yitþk
Þ 6¼ 0 for any k  1: To appreciate this insight, without loss
of generality, consider the following VAR(1) model:
 ln yit ¼ ai1 þ 11 ln yit1 þ 12it1 þ uit,
it ¼ ai2 þ 21 ln yit1 þ 22it1 þ vit,
where we assume that the innovation of economic growth, uit, is contemporaneously correlated
with the innovation of terrorism, vit; that is, uit ¼ vit þ eit: We also assume that 12 ¼ 21 ¼ 0, so
that there is no causal relationship between terrorism and economic growth. Furthermore, for
simplicity, let 22 ¼ 0. Economic growth can then be rewritten as
 ln yit ¼ ai1  ai2
Þ þ 11 ln yit1 þ it þ eit:
Based on equations (11)–(13),  ¼ when 12 ¼ 21 ¼ 22 ¼ 0: Hence, even in the absence of any
causal relationship, economic growth can still be correlated with current terrorism as long as 6¼ 0.
This is why recent empirical studies 
considered dynamic panel regressions with lagged explanatory variables. Therefore, our speciﬁcation becomes

We address Nickell bias by only estimating regional panels for which the biggest N is 24, whereas
T is 40; hence, T is always greater than N. To overcome cross-sectional dependence, we initially
applied a sieve nonparametric bootstrapping method to compute the t-statistics using various
measures of terrorism. The impact of terrorism is statistically signiﬁcant only in a few cases and
the statistical signiﬁcance is sensitive to the choice of terrorism measure.5 Such nonrobust results
may arise due to possible correlation between the common factors of regressors and those of the
regression error, which results in invalid bootstrapped critical values. Therefore, we implement
the factor-augmented panel regression to accommodate cross-sectional dependence. Combining
the causal relationship with common factors yields

We apply the modiﬁed PPC method to estimate equation (15), as discussed in Section 2.2. The
maximum number of common factors is set at ﬁve, and the convergence criterion for the iterative
procedure is 0.0001. The estimated factor numbers are slightly diﬀerent across the regions; for most
of the cases, the estimated factor numbers are between one and two. We also use Pesaran’s CCE
estimation and ﬁnd that our conclusion still holds.6
Table 3 shows the factor-augmented panel regression results. Separate analysis is performed
for total, domestic, and transnational terrorism. Furthermore, terrorism is measured as the
number of terrorist incidents divided by one thousand and, alternatively, as the number of
terrorist incidents divided by population. We report empirical results with both level and ﬁrstdiﬀerenced terrorism. The boldface and italic numbers indicate the rejection of the null hypothesis that the parameter of interest is zero at the 5% and 10% level of signiﬁcance, respectively.
Moreover, the total number of countries for each region diﬀers—see Appendix B. The domestic
GTD sample for Western Europe does not include Iceland, whereas the ITERATE sample does
not include Macau (Asia), Morocco (Middle East and North Africa), and Finland (Western
Europe). We excluded these countries because they had no terrorist incidents over the sample
period, which does not allow us to perform the factor-augmented panel regression. In terms of
magnitudes, the terrorism estimates in Table 3 are mostly smaller than the terrorism estimates
from equation (8) in Table 2. Notably, there is no statistically signiﬁcant impact of terrorism on
economic growth, which holds across all cases. Even though we do not report their p-values
except in supplementary tables, most of them are far from 0.5, so that the terrorism coeﬃcients
are not signiﬁcant even at the 50% level. In our estimates, the common factor is explaining the
variation of the dependent variable in equation (15). Notice that the signiﬁcant regional terrorism coeﬃcients in Table 2 become insigniﬁcant when we account for cross-sectional dependence
and Nickell bias in Table 3. This strongly suggests that the results from the previous literature
are sensitive to model speciﬁcation.
Robustness Checks
So far we did not include any control variables in the dynamic panel regressions. We check the
sensitivity of our results to the inclusion of control variables by including the ﬁrst diﬀerence of
log investment  ln I
Þ and population growth rates n
Þ as additional regressors in equation (15).
The empirical results with alternative measures of terrorism are reported in Table 4. Evidently, the
inclusion of other key growth variables in equation (15) does not impact our main conclusion.
The point estimates on the terrorism coeﬃcients vary in their magnitude and, sometimes, their sign,
but there are no consistent patterns to these changes. Most importantly, all terrorism estimates
remain statistically insigniﬁcant. To conserve space, we do not report the point estimates in Table 4
on lagged economic growth and other control variables (some of which are signiﬁcant); these results
are available upon request.

Dynamic Panel Analysis
 Published online by Cambridge University Press
We also examine alternative partitioning of the data based on per-capita income in US
dollars and on the number of terrorist attacks. In particular, we split our sample into three subsamples of countries with average per-capita GDP of less than $3000 (thirty countries), between
$3000 and $15,000 (twenty-eight countries), and over $15,000 (twenty-three countries), respectively.
For all estimates, terrorism is never a statistically signiﬁcant determinant of growth. We also
re-estimate Table 3 for the thirty most attacked sample countries for 1970–2009, based on the
number of total, transnational, and domestic terrorist attacks, respectively. Additionally, we
analyze a panel of the thirty most attacked sample countries (in terms of total terrorism) with
average per-capita GDP of less than $15,000, and a panel of the thirty most frequently attacked
sample countries based on the number of years of at least one terrorist attack. For all factoraugmented dynamic panels, terrorism is never a signiﬁcant determinant of growth (estimates available upon request).
Finally, we have chosen a data set used by Gaibulloev and Sandler to further show that
econometric speciﬁcation issues are behind the diﬀerences between our results and those of the
previous literature. Their original data covered eighteen Western European countries for 1971–2004
and satisﬁed the N < T condition. We dropped Finland, since it had no terrorism over the sample
period. Gaibulloev and Sandler used trade openness and investment as control variables,
and found that total and transnational terrorism reduced economic growth. We are able to replicate
their results. However, when we revise their model speciﬁcation and apply the factor-augmented

Concluding Remarks
For dynamic panel analysis, this article highlights inconsistency and invalid statistical inference that
arise from Nickell bias and cross-sectional dependence. These concerns are particularly relevant for
dynamic panel studies in international political economy, where N > T and countries’ variables are
driven by common factors. These econometric concerns are also germane to dynamic panels in
other ﬁelds of political science. We begin with a straightforward explanation for why Nickell bias
may result in inconsistent estimates. Although a large number of time periods can ameliorate the
inconsistency concern, Nickell bias may still be associated with invalid statistical inference owing to
biased t-statistics. Cross-sectional dependence can also cause invalid statistical inference and inconsistency. As cross-sectional correlation with the regression error increases, the true critical value
of the t-statistic becomes larger in absolute value, so that the proper critical value is not known.
Inconsistency arises when common factors in the error term are correlated with the regressors.
We show practical ways of avoiding Nickell bias in dynamic panel regression. For many international political economy applications, this may necessitate running regional rather than global

dynamic panels to ensure that the number of periods, T, exceeds the number of sample countries,
N. Other ﬁxes are discussed. To address cross-sectional dependence, we put forward factoraugmented regressions, where common factors are explicitly taken into account to eliminate
inconsistency worries.
The importance of our exercise is illustrated by applying our methods to the study of the impact
of various forms of terrorism on economic growth. In so doing, we provide estimates of dynamic
panel regressions for ﬁve regional conglomerates. Even though the extant literature found a
negative and signiﬁcant eﬀect of terrorism on economic growth for these regional aggregates,
our factor-augmented regressions do not ﬁnd any such signiﬁcant impact. Our speciﬁc application
highlights that avoiding Nickell bias and correcting for cross-sectional dependence may yield much
diﬀerent dynamic panel ﬁndings than those in the literature. This may also be true for other
dynamic panel applications, especially when cross-country dependence looms large.

ð Þ represents the order of magnitude. In fact, the dominant bias in equation (A3) is

Hence, the WG estimator becomes inconsistent as N ! 1:

implies that the term goes to
zero in probability as T ! 1: The ﬁrst right-hand term in (A5) has the limiting distribution of

, whereas the second right-hand term becomes purely random and depends on an N=T
ratio . If T > N, then the N=T term becomes small, so that the second
term can be ignored. However if N > T, then the limiting distribution of ^ cannot be deﬁned. In
other words, the ordinary t-statistic for ^ becomes large in absolute value as N,T ! 1 but
A.2 Factor-Augmented Regression
The CCE estimator is obtained by running the following regression with simple augmented crosssectional averages :
yit ¼ ai þ yit1 þ Xitb þ 1i yt þ 2i yt1 þ Xt 3i þ eit,
where yt, yt1, and Xt are cross-sectional averages of yit, yit1, and Xit, respectively.
The IPC estimator is obtained as follows :
1. Estimate the regression in equation (1), yit ¼ ai þ t þ yit1 þ Xitb þ uit, and obtain the
residuals, ^uit ¼ yit  ^ai  ^yit1  Xit^b.
2. Obtain the (estimated) common factors ^F
t from the residuals ^uit by the principal component
3. Run the following regression: yit ¼ ai þ yit1 þ Xitb þ l0
4. Repeat steps 1–3 until ^b converges.
The original PPC estimator is obtained by running the following regression:
yit ¼ ai þ yit1 þ Xitb þ l0
