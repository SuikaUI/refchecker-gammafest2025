Background: The cancer of colon is one of the important cause of morbidity and mor-
tality in adults. For the management of colonic carcinoma, the definitive diagnosis depends
on the histological examination of biopsy specimens. With the development of whole slide
imaging, the convolutional neural networks are being applied to diagnose colonic carcinoma
by digital image analysis.
Aim: The main aim of the current study is to assess the application of deep learning
for the histopathological diagnosis of colonic adenocarcinoma by analysing the digitized
pathology images.
Materials & Methods: The images of colonic adenocarcinoma and non neoplastic colonic
tissue have been acquired from the two datasets. The first dataset contains ten thousand
images which were used to train and validate the convolutional neural network (CNN) ar-
chitecture. From the second dataset (Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Gland (CRAG) Dataset)
40% of the images were used as a train set while 60% of the images were used as test

1 Introduction
Cancers are an important cause of mortality and mortality in the developed countries as
well as in the developing nations after the better control of infectious diseases. The estimated
number of new cases of cancer is more than eighteen million with more than 9 million deaths in
2018 (1). The colorectal (colon and rectum) cancer ranked number 3 according to the number
of malignant tumors and it is the 2nd common cause of death due to cancer in both genders
(male and female) all over the world (1). A difference in the occurrence of malignant tumors
among the different countries has been documented in the literature (2). This variation in the
prevalence rate of different types of cancers may be attributed to genetic and environmental
A rising trend in the incidence of malignant tumors has been observes around the globe
which may be attributed to the increase in the population as well as increase in the elderly
population. Malignancy may occur at any age but most common histological types of cancer are
diagnosed in old age. The most common age group is 51 – 60 years (3). It has been predicted
that the death number may rise by sixty percent until 2035 (4).
The common clinical features of colorectal cancers include rectal bleeding, altered bowel
habits, anemia and weight loss (5). Carcinoembryonic antigen is commonly used as a tumor
marker and as a screening test but definitive diagnosis requires tissue biopsy for histopathologi-
cal examination. The adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type of malignant tumor
of colon and rectum. The adenocarcinoma is characterized by large neoplastic cells with nuclear
pleomorphism and hyperchromasia. The tumor cells attempt to make glandular structures.

The important risk factors of colonic tumors are high intake of meat, old age, family history,
obesity and smoking (6-7).
With the increase in exposure to number of risk factors, the incidence of colonic cancer is
expected to rise which will generate more work load on the histopathologists. The application
of smart technology such as artificial intelligence may be helpful in this regards. The aim of the
present study is to assess the application of deep learning for the histopathological diagnosis of
colonic adenocarcinoma by analysing the digital pathology images.
2 Materials & Methods:
Total of ten thousand digital images, of histopathology slides, were obtained from LC25000
datasets. The data set is composed of 500 total images of colon tissue (250 benign colonic
tissue and 250 colon adenocarcinomas) and augmented to 5,000 images of each using the Aug-
mentor package . As the dataset is augmented, mixed, and the author did not provide any
information regarding augmentation; it was nearly impossible to split it into the train, and test
sets as such. To use this dataset, we need to evaluate a different dataset for testing purpose.
For this purpose, we used Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Gland (CRAG) Dataset . The CRAG
data set was developed for segmentation purpose, and in this study, we were working on a
classification problem. Two histopathologists labeled and divided the CRAG dataset images into
two categories , benign colonic tissue and colon adenocarcinomas. There were Forty-five (45)
images of benign colonic tissues, and one hundred forty-eight (148) images of colonic adeno-
carcinoma. Three variants of ResNet architectures, ResNet-18, ResNet-34 and ResNet-50 were
used to perform the classification (10). Following steps were taken to get the results.
Using FastAI API (11), pretrain ResNet models (ResNet-18, ResNet-34, and ResNet-50) on
ImageNet (12) were downloaded.
LC25000 dataset was split into two sets, train with 80% of dataset and valid with 20% of the
dataset. Train set contained 8000 images of both classes where valid set contained 2000 images
of both classes.
All three ResNet variances were trained on LC25000 dataset using the learning rate :1e-
2, momentum = 0.9-0.8. To use both weights learned from ImageNet and our dataset; only
weights of last ten layers were trained on LC25000 dataset.

New labeled CARG dataset was split into two sets, train with 40%, and test with 60% of the
dataset. Train set contained 78 images of both classes, where test set contained 115 images.
This unusual split where test set is larger than the train set was done to show the performance
of the self-supervised learning step, in which we trained our networks on LC25000. Reason to
retrain the network is that our CRAG dataset resolution is different from the LC25000 dataset
which is shown in figure 2.
All three ResNet variances were trained on new labeled CRAG dataset using the learning
rate:1e-4, momentum = 0.9-0.8. To use both weights learned from self-supervised learning step
and training set new labeled CRAG dataset; only the last two layers’ weights were adjusted.
The results show that in scenarios, where we have a small dataset, and standard deep learning
algorithm will end up over-fitting the data, the self-supervised learning step can be used.
In the present study, three variants of convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, ResNet-
30, and ResNet-50) have been applied to assess the digital images for the diagnosis of colonic
adenocarcinoma. The results of ResNet-50 revealed that there was discrepancy in the diagnosis
in seven digital images with the diagnostic accuracy of 93.91% while in case of ResNet -18 and
ResNet-30, the diagnostic discrepancy was in eight digital pathology images with a diagnostic
accuracy of 93.04 % and 93.04% respectively. The results are shown in table 1 & 2.

4 Discussion
The analysis of results of the present study revealed that the diagnostic discrepancy of con-
volutional neural network (CNN) was less than 7% and the computer aided diagnostic system
was able to diagnose and differentiate colonic adenocarcinoma from the non neoplastic colonic
tissue in 93% of digitized pathology images of colonic tissue.
In a study conducted by Chen PJ et, the computer aided diagnostic system revealed 96.3%
sensitivity with a negative predictive value of 91.5% for the detection of neoplastic or non neo-
plastic colorectal polyps (13). Another study performed on the image analysis of colorectal
lesions by computer aided diagnostic system showed the sensitivity of 83.9 % and specificity
of 82.6% (14). The accuracy of different deep learning models for the classification of colonic
lesions varies from 80% to 99.2% (15-18). A study carried out by Chen M et al for the classifica-
tion of benign and malignant tumors of liver by analysing the H&E images with the application
of neural network revealed the accuracy of 96% (19).

In the present study, three CNN architectures(ResNet-18, ResNet-30, and ResNet-50) were
applied for the classification of digitized images of colonic tissue. The sensitivity (96.77%) of
ResNet-50 was the highest which is followed by ResNet-30 and ResNet -18 with the sensitivity
of 95.74% and 94.79% respectively.
Recent advances in the artificial intelligence (AI) have revealed the astonishing performance
of AI in many domains where it has surpassed human being (20). Since accurate diagnosis of
the malignancy is of vital importance for the effective management of it. In spite of high clinical
suspicion of malignancy, the final diagnosis can only be established after histopathological ex-
amination of the tissue. The surgical pathology is providing diagnostic services to the clinicians
for the last hundred years. The key feature in the pathological evaluation for the diagnosis of
cancers is the microscopic examination of tissue sections. The slides are made from tissue blocks
and these slides are most commonly stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain. The basophilic
structures of cells are stained with hematoxylin which appear as blue while eosinophilic struc-
tures take up the pinkish color after staining with eosin. The basophilic structures in the cells
includes nucleus, rough endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes while majority of extracellular
structures are stained with eosin (21). Hematoxylin and eosin stain has been used for the last
one century for the diagnosis of cancer (22). This stain is used to visualize the detailed feature
of nuclei and cytoplasm which have got vital importance in the differentiation of different type
of cells and classification of neoplastic lesions (22). Hyperchromasia and pleomorphism along
with arrangement of malignant cells are characteristic features of colonic adenocarcinoma which
provide diagnostic clue to the histopathologists. The development of deep learning (a subset of
artificial intelligence) made a breakthrough in the analysis of digital images with extraction of
characteristic features. Marked improvement has been made in the image analysis with the
development of s convolutional neural network (23) .
Based on the present study findings and previously reported observations, The development
of computer aided technology to evaluate the surgical specimens for the diagnosis of malignant
tumors is expected to provide a significant assistance to the pathologists.
One of the limitation of the present study is that the proposed system is not marking the
segmented part of lesion which could further assist the pathologist. Further studies in this
regards are recommended.
