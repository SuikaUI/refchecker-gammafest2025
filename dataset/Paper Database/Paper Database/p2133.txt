The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a tremendous impact on patients and healthcare systems around the world. In the ﬁght
against this novel disease, there is a pressing need for rapid and effective screening
tools to identify patients infected with COVID-19, and to this end CT imaging
has been proposed as one of the key screening methods which may be used as a
complement to RT-PCR testing, particularly in situations where patients undergo
routine CT scans for non-COVID-19 related reasons, patients with worsening respiratory status or developing complications that require expedited care, and patients
suspected to be COVID-19-positive but have negative RT-PCR test results. Early
studies on CT-based screening have reported abnormalities in chest CT images
which are characteristic of COVID-19 infection, but these abnormalities may be dif-
ﬁcult to distinguish from abnormalities caused by other lung conditions. Motivated
by this, in this study we introduce COVIDNet-CT, a deep convolutional neural
network architecture that is tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest
CT images via a machine-driven design exploration approach. Additionally, we
introduce COVIDx-CT, a benchmark CT image dataset derived from CT imaging
data collected by the China National Center for Bioinformation comprising 104,009
images across 1,489 patient cases. Furthermore, in the interest of reliability and
transparency, we leverage an explainability-driven performance validation strategy
to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVIDNet-CT, and in doing so
ensure that COVIDNet-CT makes predictions based on relevant indicators in CT
images. Both COVIDNet-CT and the COVIDx-CT dataset are available to the
general public in an open-source and open access manner as part of the COVID-Net
initiative. While COVIDNet-CT is not yet a production-ready screening solution,
we hope that releasing the model and dataset will encourage researchers, clinicians,
and citizen data scientists alike to leverage and build upon them.
Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), continues to have a tremendous impact on patients and healthcare systems around the
 
 
world. In the ﬁght against this novel disease, there is a pressing need for fast and effective screening
tools to identify patients infected with COVID-19 in order to ensure timely isolation and treatment.
Currently, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is the primary
means of screening for COVID-19, as it can detect SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in sputum
samples collected from the upper respiratory tract . While RT-PCR testing for COVID-19 is
highly speciﬁc, its sensitivity is variable depending on sampling method and time since onset of
symptoms , and some studies have reported relatively low COVID-19 sensitivity .
Moreover, RT-PCR testing is a time-consuming process which is in high demand, leading to possible
delays in obtaining test results.
Chest computed tomography (CT) imaging has been proposed as an alternative screening tool for
COVID-19 infection due to its high sensitivity, and may be particularly effective when used as a
complement to RT-PCR testing . CT imaging saw extensive use during the early stages of
the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in Asia. While cost and resource constraints limit routine
CT screening speciﬁcally for COVID-19 detection , CT imaging can be especially useful as a
screening tool for COVID-19 infection in situations where:
• patients are undergoing routine CT examinations for non-COVID-19 related reasons. For
example, CT examinations may be conducted for routine cancer screening, monitoring
for elective surgical procedures , and neurological examinations . Since such CT
examinations are being conducted as a routine procedure regardless of COVID-19, there is
no additional cost or resource constraints associated with leveraging such examinations for
COVID-19 screening as well.
• patients have worsening respiratory status or developing complications that require expedited
care . In such scenarios, immediate treatment of patients may be necessary and thus
CT imaging is conducted on the patient for COVID-19 infection while waiting for RT-PCR
testing to conﬁrm COVID-19 infection.
• patients are suspected to be COVID-19-positive but their RT-PCR tests are negative. For
example, patients who have had close contact with conﬁrmed COVID-19 cases and are
exhibiting symptoms of the disease are highly suspect, but may have negative RT-PCR
results. In these cases, CT imaging may be used to conﬁrm COVID-19 infection pending
positive RT-PCR results.
In early studies, it was found that certain abnormalities in chest CT images are indicative of COVID-
19 infection, with ground-glass opacities, patchy shadows, crazy-paving pattern, and consolidation
being some of the most commonly reported abnormalities, typically with bilateral involvement . Moreover, some studies have found that abnormalities in a patient’s chest CT scan
due to COVID-19 infection may be present despite a negative RT-PCR test . However, as
illustrated in Figure 1, these imaging abnormalities may not be speciﬁc to COVID-19 infection, and
the visual differences between COVID-19-related abnormalities and other abnormalities can be quite
subtle. As a result, the performance of radiologists in distinguishing COVID-19-related abnormalities
from abnormalities of other etiology may vary considerably . For radiologists, visual analysis
of CT scans is also a time-consuming manual task, particularly when patient volume is high or in
large studies.
In this study, we introduce COVIDNet-CT, a deep convolutional neural network architecture tailored
speciﬁcally for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images via a machine-driven design
exploration approach. We also introduce COVIDx-CT, a benchmark CT image dataset derived from
CT imaging data collected by the China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB) comprising
104,009 images across 1,489 patient cases. Additionally, to investigate the decision-making behaviour
of COVIDNet-CT, we perform an explainability-driven performance validation and analysis of its
predictions, allowing us to explore the critical visual factors associated with COVID-19 infection
while also auditing COVIDNet-CT to ensure that its decisions are based on relevant CT image
features. In an effort to encourage continued research and development, COVIDNet-CT and the
COVIDx-CT dataset are available to the general public in an open-source and open access manner
as part of the COVID-Net initiative, a global open initiative for accelerating collaborative
advancement of artiﬁcial intelligence for assisting in the ﬁght against the COVID-19 pandemic.
The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst discuss related work on deep learning systems for
CT-based COVID-19 detection in Section 2. Next, we discuss the construction of the COVIDx-CT
dataset, the design strategy used to build COVIDNet-CT, the architecture design of COVIDNet-CT,
Figure 1: Example chest CT abnormalities in (a) a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia, and (b) a
patient with non-COVID-19 pneumonia. It can be observed that visual difference in abnormalities
between COVID-19 pneumonia and non-COVID-19 penumonia can be quite subtle.
and the explainability-driven performance validation strategy leveraged to audit COVIDNet-CT in
Section 3. Following this, in Section 4, we present and discuss the results of our experiments to
evaluate the efﬁcacy and decision-making behaviour of the proposed COVIDNet-CT, as well as a
comparison of COVIDNet-CT to existing deep neural network architectures for the task of COVID-19
detection on chest CT images. Finally, we draw conclusions and discuss future directions in Section 5.
Related work
A number of studies have proposed deep learning systems based on chest CT imaging to distinguish COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases (which may include both normal and abnormal
cases) . Many of the proposed systems further identify non-COVID-19 cases as normal , non-COVID-19 pneumonia (e.g., bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), etc.) , or
non-pneumonia . Additionally, some of the proposed systems require lung and/or lung lesion
segmentation , which necessitates either a segmentation stage in the proposed
systems or manual segmentation by radiologists. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the proposed
COVIDNet-CT deep neural network architecture is the ﬁrst to be built using a machine-driven design
exploration strategy speciﬁcally for COVID-19 detection from chest CT images.
Explainability methods have been leveraged in some studies to investigate the relationship between
imaging features and network predictions. Bai et al. and Jin et al. visualized importance
variations in chest CT images using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) .
Similarly, Mei et al. created heatmaps of COVID-19 infection probabilities within receptive
ﬁelds by upsampling their network’s predictions to match chest CT image dimensions. Zhang
et al. examined the correlation between key clinical parameters and segmented lung lesion
features in chest CT images. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to perform
explainability-driven performance validation on deep neural networks for COVID-19 detection from
chest CT images using an explainability method geared towards identifying speciﬁc critical factors as
opposed to more general heatmaps that illustrate importance variations within an image.
In this section, we will ﬁrst describe the methodology behind the construction of the COVIDx-CT
open access benchmark dataset with which we train and evaluate the proposed COVIDNet-CT deep
neural network architecture. Next, we describe the methodology behind the creation of the proposed
COVIDNet-CT deep neural network architecture via a machine-driven design exploration strategy, as
well as the resulting deep neural network architecture. Furthermore, we discuss the implementation
details as well as training strategy used to train COVIDNet-CT. Finally, we describe in detail the
strategy for explainability-driven performance validation of COVIDNet-CT.
COVIDx-CT dataset
Figure 2: Example chest CT images from the COVIDx-CT dataset, illustrating (a) COVID-19
pneumonia cases, (b) non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases, and (c) normal control cases.
To build the proposed COVIDNet-CT, we constructed a dataset of 104,009 chest CT images across
1,489 patient cases, which we refer to as COVIDx-CT. To generate the COVIDx-CT dataset, we leverage the CT imaging data collected by the CNCB , which is comprised of chest CT examinations
from different hospital cohorts across China as part of the China Consortium of Chest CT Image
Investigation (CC-CCII). More speciﬁcally, the CT imaging data consists of chest CT volumes across
three different infection types: novel coronavirus pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection
(NCP), common pneumonia (CP), and normal controls. Figure 2 shows example CT images for each
of the infection types from the constructed COVIDx-CT dataset. For NCP and CP CT volumes, slices
marked as containing lung abnormalities were leveraged. Additionally, we excluded CT volumes
where the background had been removed to leave segmented lung regions, as the contrast between the
background and segmented lung regions can lead to model biases. Finally, we split the COVIDx-CT
dataset into training, validation, and test sets, using an approximate 60%-20%-20% split for training,
validation, and test, respectively. These sets were constructed such that each patient belongs to a
single set. Figure 3 shows the distribution of patient cases and images in the COVIDx-CT dataset
amongst the different infection types and dataset splits.

Machine-driven design exploration
Inspired by , a machine-driven design exploration strategy was leveraged to create the proposed
COVIDNet-CT. More speciﬁcally, machine-driven design exploration involves the automatic exploration of possible network architecture designs and identiﬁes the optimal microarchitecture and
macroarchitecture patterns with which to build the deep neural network architecture. As discussed
in , the use of machine-driven design exploration allows for greater ﬂexibility and granularity
in the design process as compared to manual architecture design, and ensures that the resulting
architecture satisﬁes the given operational requirements. As such, a machine-driven design exploration approach would enable the creation of a tailored deep convolutional neural network catered
speciﬁcally for the purpose of COVID-19 detection from chest CT images in a way that satisﬁes
sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) requirements while minimizing computational and
architectural complexity to enable widespread adoption in clinical environments where computing
resources may be limited.
More speciﬁcally, in this study we leverage the concept of generative synthesis as our machinedriven design exploration strategy, where the problem of identifying a tailored deep neural network
architecture for the task and data at hand is formulated as a constrained optimization problem based
on a universal performance function U (e.g., ) and a set of quantitative constraints based on
operational requirements related to the task and data at hand. This constrained optimization problem
is then solved via an iterative strategy, initialized with the data at hand, an initial network design
prototype, and the set of quantitative constraints. Here, we specify two key operational requirements
as quantitative constraints during the machine-driven design exploration process: (i) COVID-19
sensitivity ≥95% on the COVIDx-CT validation dataset, and (ii) COVID-19 PPV ≥95% on the
COVIDx-CT validation dataset. These operational requirements were speciﬁed in order to ensure
low false-negative and false-positive rates respectively. For the initial network design prototype, we
leveraged residual architecture design principles , as they have been shown to enable reliable
deep architectures which are easier to train to high performance. Furthermore, the output of the initial
network design prototype is a softmax layer corresponding to the following prediction categories: (i)
no infection (normal), (ii) non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and (iii) COVID-19 viral pneumonia.
Network architecture
The proposed COVIDNet-CT architecture is shown in Figure 4, and is publicly available at
 As can be seen, the network architecture produced
via a machine-driven design exploration strategy exhibits high architectural diversity as evident by
the heterogeneous composition of conventional spatial convolution layers, pointwise convolutional
layers, and depthwise convolution layers in a way that strikes a balance between accuracy and
architectural and computational complexity. Further evidence of the high architectural diversity of
the COVIDNet-CT architecture is the large microarchitecture design variances within each layer
of the network (as seen by the tensor conﬁgurations of the individual layers shown in Figure 4).
Furthermore, the machine-driven design exploration strategy made heavy use of unstrided and strided
projection-replication-projection-expansion design patterns (which we denote as PRPE and PRPE-S
for unstrided and strided patterns, respectively) consisting of a projection to lower channel dimensionality via pointwise convolutions, a replication of the projections to increase channel dimensionality
efﬁciently, an efﬁcient spatial feature representation via depthwise convolutions (unstrided and strided
for PRPE and PRPE-S, respectively), a projection to lower channel dimensionality via pointwise convolutions, and ﬁnally an expansion of channel dimensionality conducted by pointwise convolutions.
The use of lightweight design patterns such as PRPE and PRPE-S enables COVIDNet-CT to achieve
high computational efﬁciency while maintaining high representational capacity. While these design
patterns may be difﬁcult and time-consuming to design manually, machine-driven design allows
for these ﬁne-grained design patterns to be rapidly and automatically discovered. Finally, selective
long-range connectivity can be observed in the proposed COVIDNet-CT architecture, which enables
greater representational capabilities in a more efﬁcient manner than densely-connected deep neural
network architectures.
Figure 4: The proposed COVIDNet-CT architecture design via machine-driven design exploration.
Notable characteristics include high architectural diversity, selective long-range connectivity, and
lightweight design patterns (e.g., PRPE and PRPE-S patterns).
Implementation details
The proposed COVIDNet-CT was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and then trained on the
COVIDx-CT dataset via stochastic gradient descent with momentum . The hyperparameters used
for training are as follows: learning rate=5e-3, momentum=0.9, number of epochs=17, batch size=8.
Data augmentation was applied with the following augmentation types: cropping box jitter, rotation,
horizontal and vertical shear, horizontal ﬂip, and intensity shift and scaling. In initial experiments,
it was found via explainability-driven performance validation (see Section 3.5 for more details on
the methodology) that erroneous indicators in the CT images (e.g., patient tables of the CT scanners,
imaging artifacts, etc.) were being leveraged by the network to make predictions. To help prevent this
behaviour, we introduce an additional augmentation which removes any visual indicators which lie
outside of the patient’s body, as illustrated in Figure 5. Finally, we adopt a batch re-balancing strategy
similar to that employed in to ensure a balanced distribution of each infection type at the batch
level. The proposed COVIDNet-CT was implemented, trained, and evaluated using the TensorFlow
deep learning library .
Figure 5: Example COVID-19 case before and after removal of irrelevant visual indicators as part of
data augmentation. In (a), a number of irrelevant visual indicators are present, such as the patient
table of the CT scanner as well as imaging artifacts. After removing these irrelevant indicators, the
image in (b) is obtained.
Explainability-driven performance validation of COVIDNet-CT
While scalar performance metrics are a valuable quantitative method for evaluating deep neural
networks, they are incapable of explaining a network’s decision-making behaviour. In clinical
applications, the ability to understand how a deep neural network makes decisions is critical, as these
decisions may ultimately affect the health of patients. Motivated by this, we audit COVIDNet-CT
via an explainability-driven performance analysis strategy in order to better understand which CT
imaging features are critical to its detection decisions. Moreover, by leveraging explainability, we can
ensure that COVIDNet-CT is making decisions based on relevant information in CT images rather
than erroneously basing its decisions on irrelevant factors (as we have seen in initial experiments as
described in Section 3.4). In this study, we leverage GSInquire as the explainability method of
choice for explainability-driven performance validation to visualize critical factors in CT images.
GSInquire leverages the generative synthesis strategy that was employed for machine-driven
design exploration, and was previously shown quantitatively to provide explanations that better
reﬂect the decision-making process of deep neural networks when compared to other state-of-the-art
explainability methods . Unlike approaches that generate heatmaps pertaining to importance
variations within an image, GSInquire can identify speciﬁc critical factors within an image that have
the greatest impact on the decision-making process.
Experimental results
The proposed COVIDNet-CT was analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively to evaluate its detection performance and decision-making behaviour. In particular, we report quantitative performance
metrics for the COVIDx-CT test set and qualitatively examine critical factors in the CT images as
identiﬁed by GSInquire for explainability-driven performance validation.
Quantitative results
We quantitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed COVIDNet-CT on the COVIDx-CT
dataset. For this dataset, we computed the test accuracy as well as sensitivity and PPV for each
infection type at the image level. The test accuracy, architectural complexity (in terms of number
of parameters), and computational complexity (in terms of number of ﬂoating-point operations
(FLOPs)) of COVIDNet-CT are shown in Table 1. As shown, COVIDNet-CT achieves a relatively
high test accuracy of 99.1% while having relatively low architectural and computational complexity.
This highlights one of the beneﬁts of leveraging machine-driven design exploration for identifying
the optimal macroarchitecture and microarchitecture designs for building a deep neural network
architecture tailored for the task and data at hand. In the case of COVIDNet-CT, the result is a highly
accurate yet highly efﬁcient deep neural network architecture that is suitable for scenarios where
computational resources are a limiting factor. In clinical scenarios, such architectures may also be
suitable for use in embedded devices.

We next examine the sensitivity and PPV for each infection type in Table 2 and Table 3 respectively, as
well as how these statistics could impact the efﬁcacy of COVIDNet-CT in a clinical environment. In
Table 2, we observe that COVIDNet-CT achieves good COVID-19 sensitivity (97.3%), which ensures
that a low proportion of COVID-19 cases are incorrectly classiﬁed as non-COVID-19 pneumonia
or normal cases. Moreover, given that RT-PCR testing is highly speciﬁc, we want to ensure that
COVIDNet-CT has high sensitivity in order to effectively complement RT-PCR testing. Next, in
Table 3, we observe that COVIDNet-CT also achieves a high COVID-19 PPV, thereby ensuring
a low proportion of false-positive predictions which could cause an unnecessary burden on the
healthcare system in the form of isolation, testing, and treatment. Examining Figure 6, we observe
that COVIDNet-CT is extremely effective at distinguishing COVID-19 cases from normal control
cases, and is capable of distinguishing non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases from COVID-19 cases
for the vast majority of these cases. Interestingly, while some COVID-19 cases are incorrectly
classiﬁed as non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases, far fewer non-COVID-19 cases are misclassiﬁed as
COVID-19 cases. Based on these results, it is shown that COVIDNet-CT could be used as an effective
standalone screening tool for COVID-19 patients, and could also be used effectively in conjunction
with RT-PCR testing. However, we note that COVIDNet-CT is trained on images from a single data
collection , and although this collection is comprised of scans from several institutions, the ability
of COVIDNet-CT to generalize to images from other countries, institutions, or CT imaging systems
has not been evaluated. As such, COVIDNet-CT could be improved via additional training on a more
diverse dataset.
Architecture comparison
Next, we compare the performance of the proposed COVIDNet-CT with existing deep neural network
architectures for the task of COVID-19 detection from chest CT images. More speciﬁcally, we
compare it with the deep residual network architecture proposed in (referred to here as ResNet-
50), which is capable of achieving high accuracy, sensitivity, and PPV on the proposed COVIDx-CT
benchmark dataset. It can be observed from Table 1 that COVIDNet-CT achieves a test accuracy
0.4% higher than that achieved with the ResNet-50 architecture while having 94.1% fewer parameters
and 90.2% fewer FLOPs. Moreover, as shown in Table 2 and Table 3 respectively, COVIDNet-
CT achieves higher sensitivity and speciﬁcity than the ResNet-50 architecture across all infection
types. These results highlight the beneﬁts of leveraging machine-driven design exploration to create
deep neural network architectures tailored to the task, data, and operational requirements. This
is particularly relevant in clinical scenarios, as the ability to rapidly build and evaluate new deep
neural network architectures is critical in order to adapt to changing data dynamics and operational
requirements.
Qualitative results
In this study, we leveraged GSInquire to perform explainability-driven performance validation
of COVIDNet-CT in order to better understand its decision-making behaviour, and to ensure that its
decisions are based on diagnostically-relevant imaging features rather than irrelevant visual indicators.
Figure 7 shows the critical factors identiﬁed by GSInquire in three chest CT images of patients with
COVID-19 pneumonia. Examining these visual interpretations, we observe that COVIDNet-CT
primarily leverages abnormalities within the lungs in the chest CT images to identify COVID-19
cases, as well as to differentiate these cases from non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. As previously
mentioned, our initial experiments yielded deep neural networks that were found via explainabilitydriven performance validation to be basing their detection decisions on irrelevant indicators such as
patient tables and imaging artifacts, which highlights the importance of leveraging explainability
methods when building and evaluating deep neural networks for clinical applications. Furthermore,
the ability to interpret how COVIDNet-CT detects COVID-19 cases may help clinicians trust its
predictions, and may also help clinicians discover novel visual indicators of COVID-19 infection
which could be leveraged in manual screening via CT imaging.
Conclusion
In this study, we introduced COVIDNet-CT, a deep convolutional neural network architecture tailored
for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images via machine-driven design exploration.
Additionally, we introduced COVIDx-CT, a benchmark CT image dataset consisting of 104,009 chest
CT images across 1,489 patients. We quantitatively evaluated COVIDNet-CT using the COVIDx-CT
test dataset in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and PPV. Furthermore, we analysed the predictions of
Figure 7: Example chest CT images of COVID-19 cases and their associated critical factors (highlighted in red) as identiﬁed by GSInquire .
COVIDNet-CT via explainability-driven performance validation to ensure that its predictions are
based on relevant image features and to better understand the CT image features associated with
COVID-19 infection, which may aid clinicians in CT-based screening. In our analyses, we observed
that COVIDNet-CT is highly performant when tested on the COVIDx-CT test dataset, and that
abnormalities in the lungs are leveraged by COVIDNet-CT in its decision-making process.
While COVIDNet-CT is not yet suitable for clinical use, we publicly released COVIDNet-CT and
instructions for constructing the COVIDx-CT dataset as part of the COVID-Net open intiative in
order to encourage broad usage and improvement by the research community. In the future, the
performance and generalizability of COVIDNet-CT may be improved by expanding and diversifying
the COVIDx-CT dataset, and COVIDNet-CT may also be extended to additional clinical tasks such as
mortality risk stratiﬁcation, lung function analysis, COVID-19 case triaging, and treatment planning.
However, the ability to build solutions for these tasks is contingent on the availability of high-quality
datasets. Finally, additional analysis of the explainability results may be performed in the future to
identify key patterns in the CT images which may aid clinicians in manual screening.
