Recently, a growing interest has been seen in deep learningbased semantic segmentation. UNet, which is one of deep
learning networks with an encoder-decoder architecture, is
widely used in medical image segmentation. Combining
multi-scale features is one of important factors for accurate
segmentation. UNet++ was developed as a modified Unet by
designing an architecture with nested and dense skip connections. However, it does not explore sufficient information
from full scales and there is still a large room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel UNet 3+, which takes
advantage of full-scale skip connections and deep supervisions. The full-scale skip connections incorporate low-level
details with high-level semantics from feature maps in different scales; while the deep supervision learns hierarchical representations from the full-scale aggregated feature maps. The
proposed method is especially benefiting for organs that appear at varying scales. In addition to accuracy improvements,
the proposed UNet 3+ can reduce the network parameters to
improve the computation efficiency. We further propose a
hybrid loss function and devise a classification-guided module to enhance the organ boundary and reduce the over-segmentation in a non-organ image, yielding more accurate segmentation results. The effectiveness of the proposed method
is demonstrated on two datasets. The code is available at:

1. INTRODUCTION
Automatic organ segmentation in medical images is a critical
step in many clinical applications. Recently, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) greatly promoted to developed a variety of segmentation models, e.g. fully convolutional neural
networks (FCNs) , UNet , PSPNet and a series of
DeepLab version . Especially, UNet, which is based on
an encoder-decoder architecture, is widely used in medical
image segmentation. It uses skip connections to combine the
high-level semantic feature maps from the decoder and corresponding low-level detailed feature maps from the encoder.
To recede the fusion of semantically dissimilar feature from
plain skip connections in UNet, UNet++ further strengthened these connections by introducing nested and dense skip
connections, aiming at reducing the semantic gap between the
encoder and decoder. Despite achieving good performance,
this type of approach is still incapable of exploring sufficient
information from full scales.
As witnessed in many segmentation studies , feature
maps in different scale explore distinctive information. Lowlevel detailed feature maps capture rich spatial information,
which highlight the boundaries of organs; while high-level
semantic feature maps embody position information, which
locate where the organs are. Nevertheless, these exquisite signals may be gradually diluted when progressively down- and
up-sampling. To make full use of the multi-scale features, we
propose a novel U-shape-based architecture, named UNet 3+,
in which we re-design the inter-connection between the encoder and the decoder as well as the intra-connection between
the decoders to capture fine-grained details and coarsegrained semantics from full scales. To further learn hierarchical representations from the full-scale aggregated feature
maps, each side output is connected with a hybrid loss function, which contributes to accurate segmentation especially
for organs that appear at varying scales in the medical image
volume. In addition to accuracy improvements, we also show
that the proposed UNet 3+ can reduce the network parameters
to improve the computation efficiency.
To address the demand for more accurate segmentation in
medical image, we further investigate how to effectively reduce the false positives in non-organ images. Existing methods solve the problem by introducing attention mechanisms
 or conducting a pre-defined refinement approach such as
CRF at inference. Different from these methods, we extend a classification task to predict the input image whether
has organ, providing a guidance to the segmentation task.
In summary, our main contributions are four-fold: (i) devising a novel UNet 3+ to make full use of the multi-scale
features by introducing full-scale skip connections, which
incorporate low-level details with high-level semantics from
feature maps in full scales, but with fewer parameters; (ii)
developing a deep supervision to learn hierarchical representations from the full-scale aggregated feature maps, which
optimizes a hybrid loss function to enhance the organ boundary; (iii) proposing a classification-guided module to reduce
over-segmentation on none-organ image by jointly training
with an image-level classification; (iv) conducting extensive

experiments on liver and spleen datasets, where UNet 3+
yields consistent improvements over a number of baselines.
2. METHODS
Fig.1 gives simplified overviews of UNet, UNet++ and the
proposed UNet 3+. Compared with UNet and UNet++, UNet
3+ combines the multi-scale features by re-designing skip
connections as well as utilizing a full-scale deep supervision,
which provides fewer parameters but yields a more accurate
position-aware and boundary-enhanced segmentation map.
2.1. Full-scale Skip Connections
The proposed full-scale skip connections convert the interconnection between the encoder and decoder as well as intraconnection between the decoder sub-networks. Both UNet
with plain connections and UNet++ with nested and dense
connections are short of exploring sufficient information
from full scales, failing to explicitly learn position and boundary of an organ. To remedy the defect in UNet and UNet++,
each decoder layer in UNet 3+ incorporates both smaller- and
same-scale feature maps from encoder and larger-scale feature maps from decoder, which capturing fine-grained details
and coarse-grained semantics in full scales.
As an example, Fig. 2 illustrates how to construct the
feature map of 𝑋"#
$ . Similar to the UNet, the feature map from
the same-scale encoder layer 𝑋%&
$ are directly received in the
decoder. In contrast to the UNet, a set of inter encoder-decode
skip connections delivers the low-level detailed information
from the smaller-scale encoder layer 𝑋%&
( , by applying non-overlapping max pooling operation; while a chain of
intra decoder skip connections transmits the high-level semantic information from larger-scale decoder layer 𝑋"#
* , by utilizing bilinear interpolation. With the five sameresolution feature maps in hand, we need to further unify the
number of channels, as well as reduce the superfluous information. It occurred to us that the convolution with 64 filters
of size 3 × 3 can be a satisfying choice. To seamlessly merge
the shallow exquisite information with deep semantic information, we further perform a feature aggregation mechanism
on the concatenated feature map from five scales, which consists of 320 filters of size 3 × 3, a batch normalization and a
ReLU activation function. Formally, we formulate the skip
connections as follows: let i indexes the down-sampling layer
along the encoder, 𝑁 refers to the total number of the encoder.
The stack of feature maps represented by 𝑋"#
, is computed as:
,6' , ∁𝑋%&
789:#;:'=>~,=>
789:#;:(,A')=>~B=>
, 𝑖= 1, ⋯, 𝑁−1 (1)
where function ∁(∙) denotes a convolution operation, ℋ(∙)
realizes the feature aggregation mechanism with a convolution followed by a batch normalization and a ReLU activation
function. 𝒟(∙) and 𝒰(∙) indicate up- and down-sampling operation respectively, and [∙] represents the concatenation.
It is worth mentioning that our proposed UNet 3+ is more
efficient with fewer parameters. In the encoder sub-network,
UNet, UNet++, and UNet 3+ share the same structure, where
, has 32× 2, channels. As for the decoder, the depth of
feature map in UNet is symmetric to the encoder, and thus
, also has 32 × 2, channels. The number of parameters in
𝑖LM decoder stage of UNet (𝑃O6"#
) can be computed as:
= 𝐷Q×𝐷Q× 𝑑𝑋"#
where 𝐷Q is the convolution kernel size, 𝑑∙ denotes the
depth of the nodes. When it comes to UNet++, it makes use
of a dense convolution block along each skip pathway, where
can be computed as:
= 𝐷Q×𝐷Q× 𝑑𝑋"#
As can be seen, 𝑃OTT6"#
is larger than 𝑃O6"#
. While in
UNet 3+, each decoder feature map is derived from 𝑁 scales,
yielding 64 × 𝑁 channels. 𝑃OXT6"#
can be computed as:
×64 + 𝑑𝑋"#
For the sake of the channel reduction, the parameters in
UNet 3+ is fewer than those in UNet and UNet++.
Fig. 2: Illustration of how to construct the full-scale aggregated feature map of third decoder layer 𝑋"#
2.2. Full-scale Deep Supervision
In order to learn hierarchical representations from the fullscale aggregated feature maps, the full-scale deep supervision
is further adopted in the UNet 3+. Compared with the deep
supervision performed on generated full-resolution feature
map in UNet++, the proposed UNet 3+ yields a side output
from each decoder stage, which is supervised by the ground
truth. To realize deep supervision, the last layer of each decoder stage is fed into a plain 3 × 3 convolution layer followed by a bilinear up-sampling and a sigmoid function.
To further enhance the boundary of organs, we propose a
multi-scale structural similarity index (MS-SSIM) loss
function to assign higher weights to the fuzzy boundary. Benefiting from it, the UNet 3+ will keep eye on fuzzy boundary
as the greater the regional distribution difference, the higher
the MS-SSIM value. Two corresponding N×N sized patches
are cropped from the segmentation result P and the ground
truth mask G, which can be denoted as 𝑝= {𝑝[: 𝑗=
1, … , 𝑁(} and 𝑔= 𝑔[: 𝑗= 1, … , 𝑁( , respectively. The MS-
SSIM loss function of p and g is defined as:
ℓa;6;;,a = 1 −
2𝜇c𝜇d + 𝐶'
𝜇c( + 𝜇d( + 𝐶'
𝜎c( + 𝜎d( + 𝐶(
where 𝑀 is the total number of the scales, 𝜇c, 𝜇d and 𝜎c, 𝜎c
are the mean and standard deviations of p and g, 𝜎cd denotes
their covariance. 𝛽a and 𝛾a define the relative importance of
the two components in each scale, which are set according to
 . Two small constants 𝐶' = 0.01( and 𝐶( = 0.03( are
added to avoid the unstable circumstance of dividing by zero.
In our experiment, we set the scale to 5 based on .
By combining focal loss ( ℓp: ) , MS-SSIM loss
(ℓa;6;;,a) and IoU loss (ℓ,qr) , we develop a hybrid loss
for segmentation in three-level hierarchy – pixel-, patch- and
map-level, which is able to capture both large-scale and fine
structures with clear boundaries. The hybrid segmentation
loss (ℓ;#d)is defined as:
ℓ;#d = ℓp: + ℓa;6;;,a + ℓ,qr (6)
2.3. Classification-guided Module (CGM)
In the most medical image segmentations, the appearance of
false-positives in a non-organ image is an inevitable circums-

tance. It is, in all probability, caused by noisy information
from background remaining in shallower layer, leading to the
phenomenon of over-segmentation. To achieve more accurate segmentation, we attempt to solve this problem by adding
an extra classification task, which is designed for predicting
the input image whether has organ or not.
As depicted in Fig. 3, after passing a series of operations
including dropout, convolution, maxpooling and sigmoid, a
2-dimensional tensor is produced from the deepest-level 𝑋%&
each of which represents the probability of with/without organs. Benefiting from the richest semantic information, the
classification result can further guide each segmentation sideoutput in two steps. First, with the help of the argmax function, 2-dimensional tensor is transferred into a single output
of {0,1}, which denotes with/without organs. Subsequently,
we multiply the single classification output with the side segmentation output. Due to the simpleness of binary classification task, the module effortlessly achieves accurate classification results under the optimization of Binary Cross Entropy
loss function , which realizes the guidance for remedying
the drawback of over-segmentation on none-organ image.
3. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
3.1. Datasets and Implementation
The method was validated on two organs: the liver and spleen.
The dataset for liver segmentation is obtained from the ISBI
LiTS 2017 Challenge. It contains 131 contrast-enhanced 3D
abdominal CT scans, of which 103 and 28 volumes are used
for training and testing, respectively. The spleen dataset from
the hospital passed the ethic approvals, containing 40 and 9
CT volumes for training and testing. In order to speed up
training, the input image had three channels, including the
slice to be segmented and the upper and lower slices, which
was cropped to 320×320. We utilized the stochastic gradient
descent to optimize our network and its hyper parameters
were set to the default values. Dice coefficient was used as
the evaluation metric for each case.
3.2. Comparison with UNet and UNet++
In this section, we first compared the proposed UNet 3+ with
UNet and UNet++. The loss function used in each method is
the focal loss.

(i) Quantitative comparison: Based on the backbone of
Vgg-16 and ResNet-101, Table 1 compares UNet, UNet++
and the proposed UNet 3+ architecture in terms of the number
of parameters and segmentation accuracy on both liver and
spleen datasets. As seen, UNet 3+ without deep supervision
achieves a surpassing performance over UNet and UNet++,
obtaining average improvement of 2.7 and 1.6 point between
two backbones performed on two datasets. Taking account of
both liver and spleen appearing at varying scales in CT slices,
UNet 3+ combined with full-scale deep supervision further
improved 0.4 point.
(ii) Qualitative comparison: Figure 2 exhibits the segmentation results of ResNet-101-based UNet, UNet++ and UNet 3+
with full-scale deep supervision on liver datasets. It can be
observed that our proposed method not only accurately localizes organs but also produces coherent boundaries, even in
small object circumstances.
3.3. Comparison with the State of the Art
We quantitatively compare our ResNet-101-based UNet 3+
with several recent state-of-the-art methods: PSPNet , DeepLabV2 , DeepLabV3 , DeepLabV3+ and Attention UNet . It is worth mentioning that all results are directly from single-model test without relying on any post-processing tools. Moreover, all networks were optimized by the
loss function proposed in their own paper.
Table 2 summarizes the quantitative comparison results.
As seen, the proposed hybrid loss function greatly improves
the performance by taking pixel-, patch-, map-level optimization in to consideration. Especially, the patch-level MS-
SSIM loss function contributes to assign higher weights to the

fuzzy boundary, yielding more enhance boundary-aware segmentation map. Moreover, taking advantages of the classification-guidance module, UNet 3+ skillfully avoids the oversegmentation in complex background. As it can be seen, this
approach is outstanding compared to all other previous approaches. It is also worth noting that the proposed method
outperforms the second best result on the liver (0.9675
against 0.9341) and spleen (0.9620 against 0.9324).
4. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we proposed a full-scale connected UNet,
named UNet 3+ with deep supervision in order to make maximum use of feature maps in full scales for accurate segmentation and efficient network architecture with fewer parameters. The classification-guided module and a hybrid loss function is further introduced to yielding more accurate positionaware and boundary-aware segmentation map. Experimental
results on both liver and spleen datasets demonstrated that
UNet 3+ surpasses all previous state-of-the-art approaches,
highlighting the organs and producing coherent boundaries.
