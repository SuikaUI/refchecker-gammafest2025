INTRODUCTION
The spread of COVID-19 has led to the closure
of educational institutions all over the world.
This  tested the preparedness of universities
to deal with a crisis that requires the help of
advanced technology including hardware and
software to enable effective online learning. Such
closure accelerated the development of the online
learning environments so that learning would
not be disrupted.1 Many institutions have become
interested in how to best deliver course content
online, engage learners and conduct assessments.
Hence, COVID-19 while being a hazard to humanity,
has evolved institutions to invest in online learning.
Online learning systems are web-based software
for distributing, tracking, and managing courses
over the Internet.2 It involves the implementation
of advancements in technology to direct, design
and deliver the learning content, and to facilitate

two-way communication between students and
faculty.3 They contain features such as whiteboards,
chat rooms, polls, quizzes, discussion forums and
surveys that allow instructors and students to
communicate online and share course content side
by side. These can offer productive and convenient
ways to achieve learning goals. In Pakistan,
the institutions are using Microsoft Teams,
Google meet, Edmodo and Moodle as learning
management systems along with their applications
for video conferencing.4 Other commonly used
video conferencing solutions include Zoom, Skype
for business, WebEx and Adobe connect etc.
According to our literature review, three previous
studies were found,5-7 supporting online learning
from Pakistan. The two studies at Dow University
of Health Sciences, Karachi and Lahore Medical
and Dental College, Lahore reported high student
satisfaction with online learning modalities. The
study from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assessed the
feasibility of online learning among students,
trainees and faculty members. They reported good
technology access, online skills, and preparedness
for online discussions among participants across
the medical education continuum.
With the increase in use of online modalities
during COVID-19, it is necessary to assess
their effectiveness with regards to teaching and
learning from various stakeholders.8 Therefore,
the current study explores the perception of
faculty members and students regarding the
advantages, limitations and recommendations for
online learning in Pakistan. The study is timely
as Higher Education Commission (HEC) is in the
process of implementing online learning across all
the universities in Pakistan. The findings will help
identify the required changes on priority basis to
make it more practical and worthwhile.
This qualitative case study was conducted from
March to April 2020 in two medical and dental
institutes. Ethical approval for this study was
taken from ethical review board of University of
Lahore . Using maximum variation sampling 12
faculty members and 12 students from University
College of Medicine and University College of
Dentistry, Lahore were invited to participate. In
addition to learning management system ‘Moodle’,
these colleges have recently adopted ‘Zoom’ for
interactive teaching in small and large group
formats. The participants were also involved in
online Problem-Based Learning sessions, along
with regular online assessments during COVID-19
An interview guide was developed to explore
faculty and students’ perception about online
learning modalities, its advantages, limitations
and recommendations. The interview guide was
piloted to ensure comprehensiveness and then also
validated by two medical education experts.9 Two
interviewers who were not involved in teaching
and assessment of students conducted four focus
group interviews (n=6 in each group) with faculty
members (n=12) and students (n=12) of medicine
and dentistry. The faculty and students were from
both basic sciences (1st and 2nd year) and clinical
sciences (3rd, 4th and final year). All interviews
were recorded through ‘Zoom’ and subsequently
transcribed verbatim. The data were thematically
analyzed: compiling, disassembling, reassembling
and interpretation by all the authors independently
and then corroborated to ensure analytical
triangulation.
The faculty members were predominantly
females from both basic and clinical sciences with
age range from 30-64 years. The students were from
all professional years of MBBS and BDS program
(Table-I).
Total six themes, two each for advantages,
limitations and recommendations were extracted
from the transcribed data after qualitative analysis
(Table-II).

Sub-Themes
Advantages
Flexibility
Remote learning
“It is useful in distant learning and during COVID 19 situation
we can continue our education system”.
Easy administration
“Our teacher has authority to unmute our mics and video. And
can see and check whether we are listening attentively or not”.
Accessibility
“The students who are not much confident, they contact
through the WhatsApp easily”.
Comfortable
“You can easily and comfortably listen to the lecture and learn”.
Student-centered
Self-directed
“I think eLearning is making good students more active and
self-learner.”
Asynchronous
“Second thing is that lectures have been recorded and will
uploaded soon. It is easy for us to go back and go through the
whole video for a summary or even revising it”.
Limitations
Inefficiency
Unable to teach skills
“In anatomy, the study through models was good. But hands on
training is not possible, the student will not be able to understand
properly. Skills needs actual hands on training”.
Lack of student feedback
“I find it annoying that during lectures you don’t have students
feedback whether they are getting the point or not”.
Limited attention span
“There is no continuity of lecture. We lose our concentration
and the syllabus is so lengthy.”
Lack of attentiveness
“As the students know that they will get the recordings, they
don’t listen the lecture properly”.
Resource intensive
“Lots of people might not be having these gadgets. Buying
these gadgets comes an extra burden on them in such stressful
situation”.
Maintaining
Lack of discipline
“There is some problem coming with discipline, some students
academic integrity
use to misbehave during lectures”.
Plagiarism
As this system is new to everyone, it is difficult to have
individual assessment. During assignment, they easily
copy paste stuff from web.”
Recommendations

will not be possible.”
Faculty development
“But we have to work with modality which institute has
decided and using. But there is need of throughout training
sessions”.
Increase Interactivities
“We should interact with students who are not active listeners.
The student interaction is only through the assessments and we
will be able to access the students.”
Incorporate CBL
“Case based learning is very important. It is the closest thing to
the practical life. Making it easier, rather than making
it complicated.”
Revision classes
“After this lockdown when the university will open, there
should be a revision session and practical work.”
Integrate proper Assessment “Assessment should be live videos and live recordings.”
Develop SOP’s
“The student should log in through proper ID and only they
can listen the lecture and see video”.
Quality enhancement
Proctoring
“There should be plagiarism software to check assignment.”

administrative tasks such as recording of lectures
and marking attendance. Both the students and
teachers had an opinion that online learning
modalities had encouraged student-centeredness
during this lockdown situation. The student had
become self-directed learners and they learnt
asynchronously at any time in a day.
Limitations: Faculty members and students said
that through online learning modalities they
were unable to teach and learn practical and
clinical work. They could only teach and assess

lecturing.
students also reported limited attention span and
resource intensive nature of online learning as
a limitation. Some teachers also mentioned that
during online study, students misbehaved and
tried to access online resources during assessments.
Recommendations:
suggested continuous faculty development. They
recommended a reduction in cognitive load and
increased interactivities during online teaching.
Those in clinical years suggested ways to start
online Case Based Learning. However, some were
also of the opinion that there should be revision
classes along with psychomotor hands on teaching
after the COVID-19 pandemic is under control. To
enhance quality, they suggested buying premium
software and other proctoring software to detect
cheating and plagiarism.
DISCUSSION
The current study reported advantages, limitations
and recommendations to improve online learning
during lockdown of institutions due to COVID-19
pandemic. This study interprets perspectives of
medical/dental students and faculty members,
which showed that online learning modalities
are flexible and effective source of teaching and
learning along with some pitfalls. According to the
teachers and students, online learning is a flexible
and effective source of teaching and learning as
most of them agreed upon the fact that this helps
in distant learning with easy administration and
accessibility along with less use resource and time.
Regardless of time limit, students can easily access
the learning material. This flexibility over face to face
teaching has been reported in the literature as well.2
The students also become self-directed learners,
which is an important competency for encouraging
lifelong learning among health professionals.10,11
Both the faculty members and students viewed
inefficiency to teach psychomotor skills, resource
intensiveness and mismanaged decorum during
sessions as limitations of online learning. Even
though, hands-on sessions such as laboratory
and clinical skills teaching have been disrupted
during COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that online
simulated patients or role plays can be used teach
history taking, clinical reasoning and communication
skills. Sharing recorded videos of laboratory and
clinical skills demonstration is also worthwhile.
Faculty members also complained about lack
of students’ feedback regarding understanding
of subject. Research showed that regular twoway feedback helps enhance self-efficacy and
motivation.12 The interaction between facilitator,
learner and study material along with emotional
and social support are essential ingredients
for effective learning.13,14 Internet connectivity
issues also adversely impacted learning through
online modalities, however, simply improving
internet package/speed would help resolve this.
Government should also take immediate measures
and telecommunication companies should invest in
expanding its 4G services across the country.
Recommendations reflect that decorum can be
maintained by thorough supervision of students,
setting ground rules for online interaction,
counselling and disciplinary actions.15 According to
students, the attention span during online learning
was even shorter than face to face sessions as also
supported by the literature.16 This can be managed
by using flipped classroom learning modalities,
giving shorter lectures and increasing teacherstudent interaction. As ‘assessment drives learning’,
so online formative assessments can be conducted
through Socrative and Kahoot etc. Faculty needs
training and students orientation in using online
learning tools.17 Investment in buying premium
software packages will also help overcome many
limitations and is therefore recommended.
Limitations of the Study: As the study participants
belonged to the medical and dental college from a
single private-sector university of Punjab, therefore
the findings are only applicable to similar contexts.
For generalizability, a survey based on our findings
should be conducted across the province or
country. Despite the limitations, the findings offer
an understanding of the advantages, limitations
and recommendations for improvement in online
learning, which is the need of the day.

CONCLUSION
The current study supports the use of online
institutes,
considering its various advantages. E-learning
modalities encourage student-centered learning
and they are easily manageable during this
lockdown situation. It is worth considering here
that currently online learning is at a nascent stage in
Pakistan. It started as ‘emergency remote learning’,
and with further investments we can overcome
any limitations. There is a need to train faculty on
the use of online modalities and developing lesson
plan with reduced cognitive load and increased
interactivities.
