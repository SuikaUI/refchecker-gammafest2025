Strategies for Handling Missing Data in Electronic Health Record Derived
Electronic health records (EHRs) present a wealth of data that are vital for improving patient-centered
outcomes, although the data can present significant statistical challenges. In particular, EHR data contains
substantial missing information that if left unaddressed could reduce the validity of conclusions drawn.
Properly addressing the missing data issue in EHR data is complicated by the fact that it is sometimes difficult
to differentiate between missing data and a negative value. For example, a patient without a documented
history of heart failure may truly not have disease or the clinician may have simply not documented the
condition. Approaches for reducing missing data in EHR systems come from multiple angles, including:
increasing structured data documentation, reducing data input errors, and utilization of text parsing / natural
language processing. This paper focuses on the analytical approaches for handling missing data, primarily
multiple imputation. The broad range of variables available in typical EHR systems provide a wealth of
information for mitigating potential biases caused by missing data. The probability of missing data may be
linked to disease severity and healthcare utilization since unhealthier patients are more likely to have
comorbidities and each interaction with the health care system provides an opportunity for documentation.
Therefore, any imputation routine should include predictor variables that assess overall health status (e.g.
Charlson Comorbidity Index) and healthcare utilization (e.g. number of encounters) even when these
comorbidities and patient encounters are unrelated to the disease of interest. Linking the EHR data with other
sources of information (e.g. National Death Index and census data) can also provide less biased variables for
imputation. Additional methodological research with EHR data and improved epidemiological training of
clinical investigators is warranted.

Introduction
In the 2004 State of the Union Address, President Bush called for
the adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs); and the Health
Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HI-
TECH) Act of 2009 incentivized the “meaningful use” of EHRs.1
The use of at least partial EHRs by outpatient offices in the United
States has increased from 16 percent in 2003 to 52 percent in 2010.2
The increased use of EHRs has greatly enlarged the volume of
data that are readily available to clinicians. The same EHR data
are progressively used for quality improvement projects and
research initiatives.
EHR data present significant challenges as a result of not having
been collected specifically for research purposes and are subject
therefore to considerable missing data. Improper handling of
missing data can result in significant bias. These issues will become
more relevant as EHRs become more widespread, as the volume of
discrete electronic data continues to grow, and as the access to this
data becomes increasingly available. Prior to the adoption of EHR
systems many details of clinical practice were obscured, with the
exception of relatively small chart reviews. Chart reviews, however,
can be painstaking tasks and are complicated by poor handwriting,
missing charts or pages, items being documented in inconsistent
locations, and the inability for multiple people to review the chart
simultaneously. The use of an EHR overcomes all of these obstacles,
and the reduced cost of EHR data compared to traditional research
is an attractive option. These features, coupled with an increased
access to EHR data, have attracted more “evening and weekend”
researchers lacking extensive biostatistical and epidemiological
training. EHR data present significant challenges and—in order
to reduce bias—the analyst must have a solid understanding of
observational study designs, confounding, missing data, time-toevent analyses, and multiple regression. Increased epidemiological
training of medical students, nurses, and other health care professionals who analyze EHR data is necessary, because past experience
shows this training is frequently lacking. The goal for this paper is
to highlight a number of key issues involving missing data in EHR
research, to examine some of the unique aspects of missing data in
EHR systems, to present some statistical advice about how to handle these issues according to “best practices,” and to provide some
suggested areas for future methodological research.

Understanding Data Missingness in
EHR Systems
EHR data elements can be divided into two broad categories: structured
and textual data. Structured data primarily consists of quantifiable numeric values (e.g., systolic blood pressure) and discrete elements made
up of predefined categories (e.g., diagnoses codes based on ICD-9).
Textual data (narrative data) are the free text areas of the patient chart
(e.g., physician progress note) that are difficult to analyze quantitatively
due to the breadth of human expression, grammatical errors, the use of
acronyms and abbreviations, and the potential for different interpretations of the same phrase depending on context. Structured data is very
amenable to statistical analyses because it can be stored in structured
databases that allow for reliable data retrieval. Analysis of textual data
involves a specialized branch of computer science called “Natural
Language Processing” (NLP). The authors envision NLP as a tool for
augmenting information in structured data, but argue that the capture
of structured data, whenever possible, would maximize the potential
impact of EHR systems on research and patient care activities.
Whether an EHR based analysis utilizes structured data or textual data, missing data will likely be of concern and can come in
a variety of forms. Missing data can be due to a lack of collection
(e.g., patient was never asked about asthma) or a lack of documentation (e.g., patient was asked about asthma but the response was
never recorded in the medical record). Lack of documentation
is particularly common when it comes to a patient not having a
symptom/comorbidity. Instead of recording a negative value for
each potential symptom/comorbidity, all data fields are left blank
(missing) and only the positive values are recorded. Thus it can
be impossible to differentiate between the lack of a comorbidity,
the lack of documentation of a comorbidity and the lack of data
collection regarding the comorbidity. In order to conduct research
using EHR data, it is typically necessary to assume that missing
data elements indicate a negative value. This assumption may be
substantially violated, especially for diseases that are frequently
not documented. Figure 1 is an overview of the missing data issue
in EHR systems and provides several options for mitigating this
issue. From a research perspective, the preferred situation is to
improve the completeness and accuracy of discrete data documentation in EHR records. Some clinical care providers complain
that more complete discrete electronic documentation requires
additional work; sometimes without immediate, obvious benefits
to patient care. However, it seems a poor argument to suggest that
it is acceptable to have incomplete information in the EHR even
for clinical purposes. Much of the data referred to in this paper are
elements that should be collected in the course of routine patient
care (e.g., past medical history, family history, current medications, etc.) One simple example where structured data could help
diabetes research at our institution involves the length of time that
patients fast prior to having blood drawn for a metabolic panel.
This information is frequently collected from patients but is recorded on paper. This makes it very difficult to determine if a blood
sugar value meets the American Diabetes Association criteria for a
diagnosis of diabetes. This information is also important for patient
care, and recording it in the EHR as a numeric value could make it
easier for clinicians to access it.

Absent data in EHR records can decrease the ability to create
accurate predictions. Methods for mitigating missing data are
difficult because many “NULL” values are assumed to be negative. Improving documentation, employing disease algorithms
(phenotypes), and natural language processing are methods for
decreasing the impact of potential biases.
Understanding Ways Missing Data Affect our
Understanding of Patient Care and Quality
Do EHRs improve patient care? In most studies, electronic
prescription ordering has resulted in a reduction of medication
errors and adverse drug events for both inpatient and outpatient
practice.3-4 For quality measures, the literature on this topic is
mixed. Initial analyses of the National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey found no difference in quality between paper- and EHRbased practices and found no improvement in quality with the use
of decision support systems.5-6 However, more recent studies have
shown that EHRs are associated with better care for patients with
diabetes in Cleveland7 and better overall quality of care on nine
quality measures in New York state.8 Cebul et al. hypothesize that
one reason for a difference in results may be due to newer, more
robust EHR systems.7
Regardless of its impact on quality, complete and structured EHR
data can make patient care easier by allowing previously entered
data to be reused and easily found by other providers. In the “National Priorities for Research” publication, the Patient-Centered
Outcomes Research Institute has placed a priority on research that
“seeks to improve the volume, completeness, comprehensiveness,
accuracy, and efficiency of use of clinical data collected across
healthcare systems…”9 Complete, structured EHR data also make
administrative duties, quality improvement projects, and research
projects much simpler to conduct. Structured data entry can also
lead to more complete and accurate documentation. Electronic
data entry forms can require fields to be completed, prompt the
user for more information, alert the user about numerical values
that are outside of a reference range, prevent typographical errors
with spellchecking, and enforce standardized nomenclature by
using drop-down lists. Structured data entry is becoming easier
for clinicians. Applications like Epic’s NoteWriter (Epic Systems
Corporation, Verona, WI) help build progress notes using a pointand-click interface, and new practice models are tasking medical
assistants and nurses to assist with data gathering and visit note
documentation.10
In order to improve the accuracy of disease classification using
structured EHR data (e.g., laboratory values, medications, orders,
diagnoses) standardized disease definitions and numerous disease
classification algorithms (phenotypes) have been developed (e.g.,
hypertension can be established not only by diagnosis code, but
also through office-based blood pressure readings and prescriptions for antihypertensive medications). Disease definitions based
on clinical records are becoming more formalized with initiatives
like the Chronic Conditions Warehouse definitions created by the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.11 Alternatively, an information-technology-based solution includes automatically generated
algorithms based on structured data12 as well as natural language
processing (NLP) for textual elements of the EHR.
It is anticipated that discrete coding and, hence, completeness
and accuracy will continue to improve as documentation requirements continue to expand for quality-based reimbursement, EHR
software becomes increasingly sophisticated, and voice recognition
software becomes more universal. “Smart” computer-assisted data
entry tools that would prompt clinicians to agree to automatic
discrete data entry based on NLP are envisioned for use in the
future. For example, as the clinician creates a free text note using
voice recognition software the tool could ask, “Would you like me
to add diabetes to the patient’s past medical history list?” Another
underutilized source for discrete data elements is through direct
patient-to-EHR communication. For example, the Cleveland
Clinic EHR system based on Epic includes a patient portal called
“My Chart” that allows patients to view medical records, schedule
appointments, receive health maintenance reminders, and have
limited direct communication with their physician. A new initiative
at the Cleveland Clinic, called “MyFamily,” is piloting a tool that
gathers family medical history information directly from patients
( Physicians or other health care professionals
would likely have to review and approve any patient entered information prior to acceptance of this data into the EHR, but questionnaires regarding the presence or absence of disease like the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey have found that patient
report is fairly reliable, at least for hypertension.13
Strategies to Address Missing Data
While improvements can be made in the data collection process,
it is unreasonable to believe that this will eliminate all missing
data. Therefore, it is important to understand the kind of missing
data present in EHRs and the methodologies that are available to
address this. Statistically speaking, missing data falls into one of
three categories: missing-completely-at-random (MCAR), missing-at-random (MAR), and not-missing-at-random (NMAR).14-15
MCAR refers to a situation in which the probability that a data
point is missing is unrelated to the value of that data point or to
the value of any other variable(s). Thus, if a patient’s data were
missing because he missed his appointment (i.e., data collection
opportunity) after his car was struck by a meteor, his data would
presumably be MCAR. Here, any piece of data is just as likely
to be missing as any other piece of data and, while one may lose
power for the analysis, the estimated parameters are not biased
by absence of the data. MAR refers to a situation in which the
probability that a data point is missing does not depend on the
value of that data point after controlling for all other known variable(s). For example, healthier patients are less likely to utilize the
healthcare system and may be more likely to have missing data
such as systolic blood pressure readings. Therefore, systolic blood
pressure may have a direct, positive relationship with the number
of office visits in a univariate analysis, but adequate adjustment
for current health status would make this relationship between
office visits and systolic blood pressure disappear. NMAR refers to
the extreme situation in which the probability that a data point is
Wells et al.: Missing Data in Electronic Health Records
Published by EDM Forum Community, 2013
missing depends entirely on the value of that data point or on the
value of other unmeasured variable(s). For example, if a rogue
laboratory technician refuses to enter a test result into the records
of patients with green eyes this would represent a NMAR situation. Obtaining unbiased estimates of the parameters in the face
of NMAR is difficult. However, it is difficult to imagine situations
in real life where 100 percent of the variability in missing information is either NMAR or MCAR. Methods for handling missing
data that fall into each of these categories are described next.
The simplest and most common approach to handling missing
data is to omit the cases with missing data and to run the analysis
on what remains. This is referred to as “complete case analysis” or
“listwise deletion.” Results obtained from complete case analysis
are unbiased when the data are MCAR, however, there is a loss in
power. The primary argument against complete case analysis is
that patients with missing information are systematically different
than patients with complete data (i.e., data that is not MCAR).
This argument is almost always plausible when working with EHR
data (e.g., compliant patients, patients with good insurance, and
patients with more severe disease tend to have less missing data).
Therefore, excluding patients with missing data will introduce bias.
Instead of omitting patients with missing data, one can fill in or
impute missing data points and include all patients in the analysis. Imputation of missing data in the setting of MCAR will
increase power but should not change the point estimates from
those obtained with a complete case analysis. Obtaining unbiased
estimates in the face of NMAR requires the creation of a model
that accounts for the missing data that is incorporated into the
imputation process.16 In most EHR instances, other variables
collected would be expected to explain some, but not all, of the
variation in missingness between patients. Therefore, it seems
reasonable to perform imputations using EHR data under the
assumption of MAR. Standard imputation of missing EHR data
that qualifies as NMAR without an NMAR model might produce
biased estimates but the bias should be small. This position is
supported by a paper by Lin that demonstrated that prediction models created with EHR data that included information
regarding missingness performed better.17 In other words, there
was an association between the simple presence or absence of
data with the outcome. It is difficult to test the MAR assumption
in retrospective EHR data without contacting the patients directly.
However, Rubin et al. emphasize that as the number of covariates
utilized to perform the imputation increase, the MAR assumption
becomes increasingly plausible.18 Thus, MAR missing data can
generally be imputed with a certain degree of accuracy as long
as adequate covariates are included in the regression equations
used in the imputation process.19 Since the amount of exposure
to the health care system is associated with missingness (patients
with more visits have had more opportunities for documentation) it is recommended that the degree of health care utilization
(number of encounters) and disease severity (comorbidity index)
be included as covariates in the imputation process. Validated
comorbidity indices have been created that are based solely on
ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding schemes.20 In addition, the inclusion of
follow-up time and outcome information have also been recommended as covariates and seem to improve the accuracy of results
obtained using multiple imputation.21-22
The most popular method for imputing missing values is through
a process called “multiple imputation using chained equations”
(MICE).23 What makes MICE popular is its ability to impute different variable types (i.e., continuous, unordered and ordered categorical, etc.) that may reside in the EHR, since each variable is imputed
by its own model. MICE does this by approximating the posterior
predicted distribution of each variable by regressing it on all other
remaining variables. The first variable with missing observations,
x1, is regressed on all remaining variables within the EHR data set,
x2,…,xk, where k is the total number of variables in the EHR data
set. The missing values for the variable x1 are replaced with the
predicted values produced by the regression model. The imputation
process is continued by creating regression models for each variable
sequentially and inserting predicted values into the missing data
slots until all missing values have been imputed exactly once for
the first iteration. It should be noted that imputed data are included
in the regression equations for subsequent imputations. Successive
iterations are performed to re-impute and replace imputed values
from previous iterations in order to obtain a stable estimate for each
missing data point. As long as a sufficient number of iterations have
been performed, the order in which the variables are imputed is
irrelevant.24 The MICE package in R uses five iterations for each imputation according to its default setting. This whole process is then
repeated m times to give you m imputed data sets. Although other
methods besides multiple imputation exist for handling missing
data, they are outside the scope of this paper and it can be argued
that multiple imputation is the best method for handling missing
data in most instances.13
One statistical methodology question regarding the use of imputation involves the number of imputed data sets. How many
imputed data sets are required to obtain stable estimates? In order
to estimate the number, it is necessary to understand the difference
between “missing data” and “missing information.” “Missing

particular parameter, while “missing information” is estimated
by comparing the variation in results obtained across multiple
imputed data sets. Sometimes there are a lot of missing data but
other related variables are available, so the results of imputed data
sets are quite stable (little variability); thus, there is trivial missing
information. For example, Pantalone et al. examined information
derived from the Cleveland Clinic EHR about mortality differences among a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes who were
receiving metformin plus one of several possible sulfonylureas.
The statistical model contained four variables with >50 percent
missing values that included hemoglobin A1c. Multiple imputation was performed using regression equations that were built with
all other variables in the data set, some of which had very few or
no missing values (e.g. age, gender, race, smoking). The hazard
ratios estimating the mortality risk according to sulfonylurea type
were found to be missing < 1.5 percent of the total information
expected with complete data.25 Alternatively, there may be a lot of
missing data but no related variables are available, so the results
of imputed data sets are unsteady (large variability); thus, there is
eGEMs (Generating Evidence & Methods to improve patient outcomes), Vol. 1 , Iss. 3, Art. 7

considerable missing information. Rubin’s formula for estimating
missing information has been used to determine the number of

Since the amount of exposure to the health care system is associated with missingness (patients with more visits have had more
opportunities for documentation), it is recommended that the
degree of health care utilization (e.g., number of encounters),
markers of disease severity, comorbid conditions, and social economic status be included as covariates in the imputation process.
Comorbid conditions may simply include diagnoses codes for
relevant disease entities or formal, validated comorbidity scales
that have been adapted for use with ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding
schemes in administrative data.20 In addition, the inclusion of
follow-up time and outcome information have also been recommended as covariates and seem to improve the accuracy of results
obtained using multiple imputation.21-22 Markers of disease severity
depend on the condition being studied but could include items
like serum hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values for patients with diabetes or serum cholesterol levels for patients with hyperlipidemia.
SES markers already in the EHR such as primary insurance type
(e.g., private, Medicare, Medicaid) are generally relatively crude
indicators of SES. A more precise estimate of SES can be obtained
by using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software like
ArcGIS (Esri, Redlands, CA) to geocode patient addresses and link
this with data in the American Community Survey (ACS) that is
available at the Census Block Group level.27 ACS data types include
median income, education level, and home value. Once addresses
are available, more sophisticated GIS analyses can be performed
as necessary to determine items like distance to emergency
department. Once the address has been linked to the ACS data
the address can be removed and the data set can be de-identified.
This process would not work if the institution de-identified data
prior to making it available for research unless there is a mechanism for re-identifying patients to obtain addresses. Obviously,
ACS data is not available for patients with addresses outside of
the United States. In addition, some addresses may not be found
during the geocoding process due to inaccurate address information, incorrect formatting, or gaps in the GIS address coverage. If
geocoding does not find an exact address match it is still possible
in many cases to use the less accurate income based on a five-digit
ZIP code in the ACS. In our experience at the Cleveland Clinic,
80–90 percent of patients can be mapped to their exact address,
and an additional 5–10 percent of patients can be mapped using
a five-digit ZIP. This generally leaves <15 percent missing income
data that requires imputation.
Measuring Outcomes
EHR systems present particular challenges when it comes to assessing
outcomes for a variety of reasons. First, outcomes may not be discretely entered into a diagnosis section of the patient’s chart in a timely
fashion. This can occur because the patient sought care outside of the
EHR’s health care system, did not seek treatment for the condition,
the provider did not enter the information or the patient expired. Our
general principles for measuring outcomes are as follows:
(1). Seek outcomes that are ascertained outside of the EHR system
in a fashion that is not biased toward any subset of the population. A favorite example of this is the Social Security Death Index
(SSDI), which determines the date or fact of death for any individual in the United States who has a social security number even
if they relocate. Unfortunately, the Social Security Administration
changed its policy in 2011 such that it will no longer use state
death records to identify deaths. This policy shift means that SSDI
is a less sensitive method for identifying mortality after November
1, 2011. This issue does not have an impact on the National Death
Index (NDI) maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, but the NDI data is not free. Medicare and Medicaid
data that has been linked to the NDI by the National Center for
Health Statistics is also unaffected. Death data can still be obtained
from individual state records in some instances. Other external
sources of outcome information include state and local tumor
registries, transplant registries, and disease registries maintained
within a respective health care institution.
(2). Utilize as many different sources of data as possible to ascertain
outcome information to increase sensitivity (i.e., an event is counted if the outcome is identified in any of the sources). For example,
Kumbhani et al. used EHR data to create a model for predicting
outcomes following Acute Coronary Syndromes. In order to improve the sensitivity for capturing cardiac outcomes the researchers
included any of the following findings: new encounter diagnosis
for myocardial infarction using ICD-9, serum troponin-T >0.08
mcg/L, or new current procedural terminology (CPT) code for a
coronary revascularization procedure.28 This increases the sensitivity for capturing the outcome, and none of these items are mutually
exclusive. Similarly, we have found that some office procedures are
not always documented in the order/procedure section of our EHR.
For example, a procedure performed by the physician (e.g., excision
of a skin lesion) does not require an order to be placed. In this instance, the only structured location for this item is via CPT code in
billing records. In some instances it may be necessary to manually
review diagnostic test results in order to determine if the outcome
occurred. The simple presence of a diagnostic test may determine
the pool of patients who may have developed the outcome (i.e., if
a condition requires a specific test in order to make the diagnosis,
then it may be safe to assume that patients who did not undergo the
test did not develop the outcome of interest). This can help to limit
the extent of any manual chart review.

number of events make sense clinically, and are the number of
events consistent with publications in the scientific literature?
Manual chart reviews should also be performed on a random
subset of patients to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the
outcome ascertainment.
(4). Patients should be censored at the time of their last follow-up
in the EHR system unless the outcome is determined by regional or national data sets that are not dependent upon the EHR.
Censoring helps to decrease potential bias caused by not capturing
events that may occur at another health care institution or in folks
who die suddenly. National data sets such as the NDI should also

follow-up times in the survival analysis and thus increasing statistical power. Previous studies have found that the NDI captures
87–98 percent of deaths in the United States.29
Discussion
EHR data have obvious limitations when utilized for research
purposes. These limitations include inaccurate information and
lack of study specific variables. Thus, EHR data will never eliminate the need for research involving primary data collection.
However, EHR research can still lead to important knowledge
from investigations that might otherwise be unfeasible or too
costly to perform. Using a limited number of common discrete
data types available in the Cleveland Clinic EHR (e.g., age, gender,
race, smoking, labs, vitals, medications, diagnoses) researchers
are successfully publishing a variety of research articles.28,30-33 And
it’s important to note that despite the flaws in these data they have
succeeded in creating accurate risk prediction models.
The increasing volume of EHR data has greatly expanded the
availability of data for research purposes, and methodologies for
handling these data are rapidly changing. Data in the EHR provide
an opportunity to improve patient outcomes through research and
the development of clinical decision support tools, but the issue of
missing data is raised. Increased use of disease phenotyping and
natural language processing can decrease missing EHR data used
for research. Improved documentation methods that decrease
missing data without overburdening clinicians should improve
patient care and research simultaneously. Researchers using these
data need to be well versed in biostatistical methods regarding
missing data. Fortunately, EHRs tend to contain many data points
and frequently can be linked with outside sources that can help to
reduce possible confounding, can improve imputation, and can
help to capture the outcome(s) of interest.
