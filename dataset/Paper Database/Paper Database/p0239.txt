INTRODUCTION: HEARING AND BEHAVIOUR
The recent appearance

of a justly celebrated
work on visual perception makes only too
how far the study of hearing by psychologists has lagged behind
that of vision.

this type of information is excluded by Vernon, and she is interested rather in the organization of patterns of stimulation into the
final experience and response.
It is at this level that such classic
visual problems of psychology as apparent movement, the constancies, or reversible figures,
A multitude of experiments have been performed on them and provide a sound basis
for a broad review;
but no corresponding classic problems have
arisen from hearing.
The nearest approach to equivalent work
using the ear rather than the eye is provided by the excellent and
detailed studies which have been made of the cues necessary for
speech sounds to be intelligible, particularly through a background

of a book comparable to Vernon's;

During the past few years the writer
has been engaged in research on one such limited aspect, and has

further similar evidence has been given by Deutsch .

for these phenomena) become critically important.

Studies of simultaneous stimulation, then, must be carried out
before any truly testable theory of behaviour can be formulated.
No theory can be adequately tied to observation if it

about the rules governing stimulus reception.
Our present line
of enquiry is therefore of distinct relevance to behaviour theory
and although the fact that human subjects are used throughout
may seem to introduce an extra complication, the pecuHarities of
human beings and the advantages of using them may be illuminated by these experiments.
Let us now turn to more factual matters, having prepared the
mind of the reader to perceive some aspects of the experiments

the importance of such preparation.

Let us consider some very simple quantitative aspects of speech.
In the first place, each word is chosen from a vocabulary of fairly
definite size.
Basic English contains 850 words

it is a definite number and also because
it obviously has
less than the maximum vocabulary a man can use.
If a man can
make a different response to any word of Basic which he hears,
he must have at least 850 possible states of each part of the neural
mechanism between stimulus and response.
Now suppose that
he hears a two-word sentence.
if he makes a response
dependent on the sentence, he must have
a certain number of
possible states
but the number is now the square of 850, namely
A three-word sentence requires over 60,000,000 states

Before going further into a theoretical
discussion of the experiments,
let us simplify the terms we have

The process we have been considering, in which one of a set

at the far end,

signals convey twice

As we have
the ensemble of
two-word sentences
is not twice as large as that of single words,
so the information cannot be taken as numerically equal to the
size of the ensemble.)
But information also considers probability
as well as the size of the ensemble, and so is more general than the
latter term.
The reasons for this may be given as follows.
If we return to our psycho-physical experiment, we remember
that the subject says

His conclusions may be accepted as proving

This in itself suggests
that we have here a more important aspect of language than

it is clearly one in which men have an

is correct,
it should follow that species
which do not possess language should also be deficient at dealing
with stimulus sequences of any kind:

Transient Effects of Noise
A typical result is that of Ford .

Pollock and Bartlett
 also found that a problem-solving task showed an
effect of noise which wore off day by day, but in their case this
may have been due to automatization of the task with practice.
The repeated effect found by the other writers as the noise was
turned on and off cannot be due to practice.

that the transience of the noise effect may be due to extra effort

In general
is agreed by most writers that the sudden onset

events within the man would be as follows.
His capacity is limited, and therefore a filter placed early in his
nervous system selects only part of the information reaching his
sense-organs.
This will normally represent information necessary
PERCEPTION AND COMMUNICATION
for his task.
The filter has a bias, however, towards channels on
which any novel event occurs.
Thus the onset of a noise causes
filter to select auditory information, and so task information
does not reach the perceptual system.
As the bias is only towards
novel events, the status quo is rapidly reestablished and efficiency
on the task returns to normal.
Stopping the noise will produce a
similar temporary change.
As has been said, this view seems more plausible than that of a
man thrown into a momentary inability to respond by any mode
but on either theory the fact that the onset of a noise causes a
drop in the efficiency of a visual task is a limited capacity phenomenon.

Experiments Showing No Effects of Noise
The various experiments we have already mentioned could be
counted as showing no
eff"ect of noise other than a transient one.
By the close of the work-period the subjects were usually performing as well in noise as in quiet.
But the period was extremely
of the order of 10 min.
Most of the early experiments
using longer work-periods are objectionable on statistical grounds.
But the main evidence that performance can be maintained for
long periods in noise comes from war-time researches, which are
adequately based.
In one case, at Tufts College , operators

earlier experiments.

Apart from
great practical importance of this result,
it is quite consistent with
our filter theory that only certain sensory stimuli are passed to the
perceptual system.
At the same time, from our present point of

to minimize the effects of noise.
In most of the tasks used the rate of transmission of information
through the man was low.

such tasks as hand steadiness or the pursuit rotor, there was no

Thus in psychophysical experiments such as judging distance, or
in tasks such as choice reaction, each signal occurs at a time which
is roughly known to the subject and is preceded and followed by
intervals in which little or no task information reaches the senseorgans.
During these intervals the man could show good performance even though he closed his eyes.

levels, though not of course in the
particular noise used in this case.
PERCEPTION AND COMMUNICATION
The effect was quite startling, the proportion of signals seen in
less than 10 sec being 0-36 for quiet, and only 0-22 for noise, a
drop of nearly 40 per cent.
It must of course be remembered
that this experiment had deliberately chosen conditions likely to

there was not only noise but also vibration involved in this case,
so that its theoretical implications are less clear than those of the
laboratory experiment, but
it shows that similar
effects appear
under more realistic conditions.
To show that the amount of impairment depended on the task,
another experiment was carried out which was
exactly the same as the original twenty dials one except that the

was over twice as many with this display as with the previous one.
As was pointed out in the
last chapter,

a change in the display of this kind should therefore reduce the
capacity needed and lessen effects of competing stimulation.
must be added,
lest the reader acquire a misleading impression
of the way in which research
is carried on, that this theoretical
way of putting matters was not formulated before the experiment.
An easier display was used because
it had been found by other
workers to minimize the effects of other stresses.)
The effect of
noise disappeared.
As the altered task had not been previously
used in quiet to confirm the absence of any difference between
days, another ten subjects were tested in a counterbalanced order
of noise and quiet
: but there was still no difference on the average
between the noisy days and the quiet days, when the whole group
of twenty subjects was considered.
We next need to enquire whether this absence of effect on the
twenty lights task means that the subjects are truly unaffected by
the noise when doing
this task:
or whether
it means that the

is not one which reveals
the fact in the score.
Detailed analysis suggests the latter alternative, which is indeed the one supported by the point of view we
are urging.

Furthermore, it will be shown in Chapter 7 that an independent test

which again bears on the interpretation of earlier experiments.
So far, then, we have shown that an effect of noise can appear
when the particular conditions of earlier experiments are avoided.

In addition Broussard, Walker and Roberts ,

It is desirable to consider also a task in which signals arrive at

experiments, we cannot suppose that noise produces a lowering of

it is one which may show effects of noise.

All the above variations in conditions were
first tried by Mackworth .
Another somewhat
' motivational

is the presence or

Fraser used the clock test
to investigate another problem, the angle of the display relative
to the horizontal.

Secondly, Adams has performed an experiment similar
to Fraser's but has found only a shift in overall performance, and
not in decline during a run, when the brightness or duration' of
the signal were changed.
To be exact, the effect of these signal
variables on the decline was not statistically significant, although
it did seem to be very slightly in the direction predicted by Fraser.
It may be suggested that this was because Adams compared the

THE GENERAL NATURE OF VIGILANCE
Certainly the effect of signal brightness on decline has been found
in other experiments, and
is implied in results by Bakan which
will be discussed later.
However, the negative results of Adams
should be borne in mind by the reader when assessing the validity
of our argument
in the chapter, when the theoretical importance of the effect of signal duration will be discussed.
these exceptions experiments with long lasting signals have not
usually found any decline in performance as the watch goes on.
We have now considered most of the experiments using the
original clock test and highly similar variants, and
is clear that
the rapid decline in performance which they sometimes show can
be prevented by knowledge of results, by increasing the visibility
of the signal, by outside stimuli such as a telephone message or
the presence of the experimenter, by a brief rest, or by lengthening
the time of appearance of the signal.
There is one variant of the
test which should be mentioned
for the opposite

and this result will be mentioned repeatedly.
We may now turn to consider other vigilance tasks derived from
the clock test.
Some of these show striking declines in efficiency
and others do not.
Vigilance Tasks Differing from the Clock Test
Bakan has produced a variant on the vigilance technique
which appears to be very sensitive.
He delivered to the subject a
regular series of light flashes.
Occasionally one of these flashes
would be slightly brighter than the others, and the subject had to
report this.
If he failed to do this, another flash with even more

so Fraser took as a measure the variance of

The variance increased as time went
on, and once again the test appeared highly sensitive.

Broadbent used the

Equally negative are the results of Elliott , who used the

A last curious feature of Elliott's experiment was that his subjects
were allowed to read or write as they chose during the course of
the experiment
but that this had no effect on their performance.
Such a course is only possible with an auditory task in which the
stimulus is bound to reach the sense-organs whatever the subject's
momentary activity.
A caution which should be given is that the
absence of any decline during a run in Elliott's results does not
mean that his subjects were achieving good performance throughout.

in his listening task there was sometimes a repeated neutral stimulus but no decrement.
This might
be explained by saying that the neutral stimulus was very different
from the signal and so did not generalize ; yet Wilkinson's was also
very different.
Another similar exception
is furnished by the effect of altering
signal visibility in a number of experiments we have already considered.

Inhibition must therefore be conceived
operationally as

With these qualifications we have whittled down the inhibition
view to a simple statement that hysterics show more rapid extinction.
But this raises the second type of difficulty for the theory.

We may add that preliminary trials by the writer at

(In Chapter 9 a view of rote learning
will be indicated according to which, the effect of massing rote

And there is an additional step involved
in deciding what other processes, such as figural after-effects, are
to be taken as instances of inhibition.
Finally, as has been said
previously,
there seems no connexion
all between
inhibition
and other characteristics of the extravert such as his preference for
speed rather than accuracy and his different level of aspiration.
summary, Eysenck's theory of extraversion provides a working approach rather than an established theory, for it has not been related
in sufficient detail to the various phenomena of behaviour to allow
us to accept it on the same level as the various Hullian concepts.
Despite these difficulties,
it may be argued that the inhibition

it has been applied, and made predictions.

Briefly, the objection is

of extraversion,
this time from a rather different point of view.

should not be lost to view during the search for scientific understanding. To many who are acquainted chiefly with such machines
as watches or steam-engines, the suggestion that analogies from
machines should be applied to human beings carries the implication that personality is to be ignored.
Yet the whole importance
of the study of information flow in machines
is that systems are

obeying common laws.
It would indeed be wrong
if, as Hearnshaw supposes, the tradition of Galton was being ignored.
But the analogy with machines
is not intended to overthrow the
study of individual differences:
rather to extend
it and place
on a more exact footing.
Let us consider a translating machine.
In principle there are
a number of ways of building such a machine,
all based on the
underlying conception of a machine which responds with words
in one language when given words in another.
At one extreme
there is the type of machine which, when given one word, re'sponds
immediately with another word.
At the other extreme there
the type which waits until a whole sentence has arrived and then
responds with a whole sentence.
To the latter one can say

' and obtain the answer
' I have just seen him
whereas the former will probably say
* I come of the to see

Yet the former also has
assets which are so great that most existing translating machines
tend towards this extreme.

is the advantage
which weighs most with translating machine designers
having an ensemble sufficient to cope with a reasonable vocabulary
of words in all the possible sequences in which they might arrive
would be unrealistically big.
In other fields the relative merits of speed and of accuracy may
be more important;
for the same antithesis will appear

Thus we would not expect any difference in time taken to run a

will be longer in starting.

On the one hand,

A rather different form of explanation in terms of relearning
has recently been put forward by Uttley .
His contention
is that each different possible sensory event produces a different
event within the nervous system:
thus far, this
is similar to the
informational approach we have been adopting throughout this
book, though Uttley
is concerned with rather different problems
from those which have led us to concentrate on the filtering of
incoming information.
He then suggests that the brain

this probability exceeds some critical value, the occurrence of the

The output
from the system after event X will then be ^ if X has often been

this could be arranged by making some part of the brain take up

Ano'ther neglected phenomenon
to which Uttley has applied
his system is that of
' induction
This effect is usually described
by theorists of classical conditioning in the following way.
animal has been trained with several stimuli, so that some produce
positive conditioned responses and others produce no response,

THE NATURE OF EXTINCTION
Uttley drew attention to the fact that,

With an animal trained by such a process of alternate presentation,
we may well find that the positive stimulus gives an enhanced
effect when preceded by a negative one and vice versa.
Is this explanation of
' induction
' a valid one
It depends, of
course, on the animals showing the effect having been trained in a
particular way
just as the explanation of disinhibition does, and
we expressed some doubts about the

Differentiation in a classical or Pavlovian situation cannot be established

A similar situation will apply just after

difficulty comes from the
fact that much of the
time elapsing between stimulus and response is due to peripheral

There seems no reason

first response should not overlap the

Yet the amount of delay for the second stimulus

This is confirmed by Davis .
In other words the amount

channels (though also as we shall see consistent with the single
channel view).
Our belief that this is the core of their argument
is strengthened by the fact that they do plot the distribution of
stimuli at different intervals after the warning signal on one side
alone (p. 126).
How far can this interpretation be applied to the earlier experiments
stimuli have come from
rather than from
sources and
inter-signal
intervals have been no more frequent than those
of any other
Thus the cumulative probability of a signal given that
one has not already occurred will increase with time since the first
signal, and the shortest interval should give the longest reaction
time and so apparently provide evidence for refractoriness.
the other hand, Davis pointed out that the longest intervals did not give the shortest reaction times either in his results
in those of Elithorn and Lawrence:
and that there was no
independent evidence that reaction time would follow the cumulative probability of a signal over a range of fore-periods in the
way postulated.
Mowrer had indeed shown that, when one
length of fore-period was more common than any other, reaction
time was shorter than at any other value of fore-period

We might expect then that

On the one hand, there will be a tendency for the

is longer.
On the other hand, there will

Reaction time was faster than in the two-stimulus case when the

that activity will be proceeding in other sensory nerve fibres, and
that the occurrence of an environmental event can therefore be
confidently detected only by comparing the activity in a group of

Once the activity has remained different for such a period of time,
it may be attributed to the environment rather than to chance.

probably suggest that the refractoriness is in this case not due to
feedback, but to a decreasing periodicity of the sampling from the
time of the first signal.

Anticipation

Any means of cutting down this lag is highly advantageous biologically, and various means are in fact adopted in human skilled

last section.
In a rough sense this has
been known since the early studies of Bryan and Harter (1899)
on the performance of telegraphists, and the analysis of processes
as reading aloud required subjects to make a
series of hand movements from
a central point to outer points
and back again.
In one condition the outer point to be touched
next was signalled at the time when the central point was touched
in another condition the next outer point was signalled as the last
one was touched.
Thus in the second condition the information
was available at a time when a movement to a known point (the
centre) was
to be made before the information was used,
whereas in the

From what we have said
it might be that in

passed through the P system, that this
is sufficient to initiate a
series of responses
and that the P system is occupied with these
responses until such time as another event must be detected to
produce another series of responses.

it was found by Broadbent 
for the multi-channel listening case, that practice on one channel

So also Bahrick, Noble and Fitts found
that practice in responding to a regular series of stimuli allowed
that task to be combined more effectively with another;
practice had no such

repeating character.
It may be questioned, however, whether this is all the benefit to
be drawn from perceptual
anticipation.
It may be that feedback on the progress of response need not be continuous

is reduced
not only because fewer items of incoming information need be
handled but
also because fewer items

Thus if two men were trained to respond to light signals, one by
a key and the other by typing out

sufficient training might nearly equate the amount of interference
showed on some simultaneous task.
This point requires further
and rather more laborious investigation.
Why, on such a view, should the P system be used in response

it is not necessary to handle feed-back information ?

In summary, anticipation falls into two varieties.

rates the span can be increased by using the short-term storage
method of recirculating through the P system during
arrival and departure of information.
Perceptual
anticipation, on the
other hand, depends on long-term
storage and
greatly lessens the demand on the P system.
It is the basis of the
fact that human beings can be treated as mathematically equivalent
to communication channels,
since they adjust themselves
optimal coding, and thus improbable signals take longer to
response than probable signals do.*
Speed and Load
So far we have been considering skills in which there is only one
source of signals.
But there are very many practical cases in which
this is not so
in flying an aircraft, attending several cotton looms,
driving through traffic or attempting to score in a football game there
are many sources of information each transmitting at its own rate.

whatever the explanation these results at high rates

High rates of signalling produce omissions but have relatively

If we examine

The effect of this is to produce a rate of responding which
is more constant than the rate at which signals arrive;
clumps of nearly simultaneous stimuli are converted into evenly

it should be noted, had to be
performed by one hand and only one at a time.)

concern us, however.
One is that some of the difficulties are due
to the operation of the filter and of the other mechanisms we have
discussed in this book.
To take the example of the effect of lag
between control and
display, the
difficulty here may be that of
short-term storage when continuous input and output have to be
kept flowing.
The problem has already been discussed
one might suggest that the
effect of lags in a discontinuous task (such as aiming darts

is because the information has to arrive by two

An alternative possibility which
has much merit

it should do so in biological ones.
Whatever the true explanation of these cases,
it is clear that the
kind of system we have been postulating will handle information
presented in some ways better than
it will that arriving in others.
Filtering and storage of information normally lead to efficient use
of a limited neural mechanism, but they will place restrictions on
the speed with which items of information can arrive (no matter
how small the ensemble from which the items are drawn), and
on the number of sensory channels by which they arrive (particularly when they arrive quickly).
It is interesting to note that

We are now nearing the end of our journey, and have finished
discussing experimental results.

broad generalizations resulting from them:

More serious, by this stage in the argument it may be a
little unclear what conclusions are to be regarded as well-founded
and what is merely a tentative conclusion for further experiment.
For this reason the first step to be taken in this last chapter
put together formally our main conclusions.
SUMMARY OF PRINCIPLES
(A) A nervous system

it as having
a limited capacity.
(B) A selective operation
is performed upon the input to this
channel, the operation taking the form of selecting information
from all sensory events having some feature in common.
features identified as able to act as a basis for this selection include
the intensity, pitch, and spatial localization of sounds.
(C) The selection is not completely random, and the probability

described as primary reinforcements for that drive.

or before events leading to such reinforcers

) are more likely to be selected in future.
(F) Given that two signals have been selected one after another,

is stored within the nervous system in a
long-term (relatively slowly decaying) store.
(G) In accordance with Deutsch's postulates, when an animal
is in a drive state
it will indulge in appetitive behaviour until one
of the temporarily high priority events occurs at its sense-organs.
Its behaviour will then vary
in such a way that
it receives that
ordered series of stimuli which, from a count of past conditional
probabilities, has the highest
probability
of terminating
primary reinforcement for that drive.
(H) Incoming information may be held in a temporary store at
a stage previous to the limited capacity channel
it will then pass
through the channel when the class of events to which
it belongs
is next selected.
The maximum time of storage possible in this
way is of the order of seconds.
(I) To evade the limitations of (H)
it is possible for information
to temporary
after passage through the limited
capacity channel
this provides storage of unlimited time at the
of reducing the
of the channel
further and
possibly to zero.
(Long-term storage does not affect the capacity
of the channel, but rather
is the means for adjusting the internal
coding to the probabilities of external events;
so that the limit

on the channel
is an informational one and not simply one of
a number of simultaneous stimuli.)
(J) A shift of the selective process from one class of events to
another takes a time which
is not negligible compared with the
minimum time spent on any one class.
Of the above principles,
(E) and (G)
are the most tentative.

There are two answers to this objection.
First, it is indeed true
that the principles lead to no prediction which is contrary to everyday observation.
It would be a poor set of scientific principles
which did do so
though it is not uncommon for psychologists to
feel that they ought to contradict common beliefs about behaviour.

by theorists in the appropriate fields.
For instance
(6) Some of the phenomena of temporary extinction may be
due to failure of the conditioned stimulus to be selected.
(7) The great value of reinforcement in facilitating learning (as
opposed to performance) may
lie in the high priority which reinforcers have for passage through the limited capacity channel,
and therefore the greater
effect they have on the stored probabilities.
Other high priority stimuli would do the same
if performance were secured.

theorists may be very largely due to properties of the short-term

The phenomena thus change with

provided that those theories are tested by predictions which few
(if possible, no) other theories would make.
The proper road for progress then
is to set up theories which
are not at first detailed, although they must be capable of disproof.
As research advances the theory
will become continually more

It may be useful practice in rigorous thinking to

Where adequate explanations of objective
events have been reached,
is rather by a process of narrowing
down the possibilities like that we have described.
The example
of Newton's Principia, given by Hull,
is misleading;

it was based on centuries of previous advance in which competing

Furthermore, the expository
technique of the Principia
is not that of Newton's own
work, such as that on optics.
It seems likely that he was forced
away from his own conception of scientific method by the pressure
of rather backward-looking criticism from those who surrounded
him .
Rather than regard the geometric
form of the Principia as the ideal,
it might be plausible to call
