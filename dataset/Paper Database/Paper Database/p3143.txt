Background/Objectives: Learning is getting transformed into digital and digital coursework is evidently seen to have
increased adoption. Major consumer base for e-commerce companies is India wherein learners and instructors form a
major part. So, many e-commerce companies are well positioned to service this need having an eye on education market. The
rapidly growing internet and smartphone penetration in the country is expected to further fuel this growth. India’s leading
e-commerce companies are in a competitive environment offering e-learning material for formal education, certificate
courses, E-books, coaching materials for competitive exams, online tests etc. Some e-commerce companies also offer hobby
courses. The study investigated the Information Control Technology (ICT) related factors that decide the adoption of various
online offerings from e-commerce companies for the purpose of education. Method/Statistical Analytics: Simple random
sampling has been applied for the research to collect the required sample. A structured questionnaire was distributed to
collect the data from about 100 consumers including learners and instructors. A conceptual framework was developed to
analyze the ICT factors impacting adoption of e-commerce offerings for education. Application/Improvements: This study
provides valuable guidance to policy makers and providers of e-commerce in education in understanding the ICT factors
influencing consumer adoption. Findings: ICT infrastructure has a significant impact on the perceived satisfaction of the
stakeholders (Learners and Instructors) followed by ICT skills and then the ICT Support. Also consumers view insufficient
ICT skills to take advantage of new technology as a significant challenge. Thereby they see a need for continuous technical
training. Other major concerns from respondents on the ICT infrastructure is about the unavailability of up-to-date ­antivirus protection in their systems, unavailability high-speed internet connection and multi-media incompatibility issues.

1.  Introduction
Internet coupled with developments in Information
Control Technology (ICT) has become a significant
business platform. This drastic growth has leveraged
E-commerce to altogether a new level. India has got 65%
of its population below 35 years of age. The demand-sup­
ply mismatch for quality education has reached massive
proportions and eventually the use of ICT has become
inevitable to address the demand for quality education.
Thereby in recent times, online courses and other study
materials offered online tend to be the attraction of learner
and instructor community.
The primary objective of this research paper is to
review the use of E-commerce offerings for Education
and training purposes. Being aware that learners and
instructors as consumers play a major role in the growth
of e-commerce business, the second goal is to analyze
the impact of Information Control Technology (ICT)
on adoption of the E-commerce offerings by Learner
and instructor community. Consumer’s opinion about
e-commerce offerings were elicited from the perspective
of learners and ­instructors. To develop a suitable model,

Prior reviews have discussed the role of e-commerce in
Educational sector in various views discussed in detail as
1. E-commerce is in itself is a very well established
industry now with several e-commerce websites
prevalent on the cyberspace. This has necessitated the
need among learners and instructors that they need be
equipped with knowledge on ICT. The global educa­
tion sector is no longer restricted to just classrooms.
The online learning space in Indian educational sector
is also growing dramatically. Some of the e-commerce
applications offered by Educational institutions for
their student body:

2.3.1  Sample
The sample comprises of online users which includes
full-time, part-time, distance education learners and
instructors. The research design is descriptive in nature
for the study. The sampling technique that is used for the
study is simple random sampling. A group of respondents
were selected through simple random to avoid any sort of
bias in the research and then the questionnaire was circu­
lated to them in the form of electronic survey for which
response was collected. Survey method of primary data
collection using questionnaire adopted for collection of
primary data.
2.3.2  Data Analysis and Interpretation
SEM was used to analyze the collected data and evalu­
ate the suitability of the model. Cronbach’s alpha scores
were calculated to test the reliability and consistency of
each ICT factor. The findings show that the overall reli­
ability score is 0.9867 as shown in table1 which is above
the minimum acceptable level of 0.8.
3.  Results and Discussion
3.1  Structural equation modeling (SEM):
Model fit assessment
Structural equation modeling (Figure 1) was used to ana­
lyze the model fit based upon the primary data that was
collected. This model is held as the most useful for assess­
ment of causal relationship between variables and for
verifying the suitability of the estimated model. For evalu­
ating the model fitness, emphasis was given to chi-square
value, Probability value, Goodness of Fit Index (GFI),
Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI), Comparative Fit
index (CFI), RMR and Root mean square error of approx­
imation (RMSEA) (Table 2).

1.6  ICT Factors impacting adoption of
Online Education
ICT facilitates anytime, anywhere learning provid­
ing access to remote learning resources and thus helps
expand access to education. Research likewise suggests
that use of ICT increases learner motivation and engage­
ment in the learning process provided with adequate ICT
support and training on ICT skills. ICT infrastructure
cost is discussed in detail as fixed cost and Variable cost.
Retrofitting of physical facilities, hardware and software
upgrades and replacement are some of the fixed cost
involved. Internet connectivity and other maintenance
support cost are some of the recurrent or Variable cost
involved. ICT infrastructure cost, changes to instructional
design owing to ICT developments, ICT skills, equity of
access to ICT are some of the challenges discussed in this
article. As outlined in this article, technological literacy
covers the below listed aspects4:
Fundamental technical skills and concepts
Usage of the electronic devices and accessories
Usage of productivity tools like word processing,
spreadsheets etc.
Usage of collaboration tools like emails, blogs etc.
Elementary knowledge in accessing web applications
2.  Methods
2.1  Data Collection and Sample
In this study, consumer (learners and instructors) per­
ceptions were gathered using a structured questionnaire
circulated in the form of electronic survey. Five-point
scale was used to increase the sensitivity of the measure.
Data on learners’ and instructors’ perception about the
three ICT factors – ICT skills, ICT Infrastructure and ICT
support were collected.
2.2  Data Analysis
Data collected from 100 consumers which includes 16
full-time learners, 56 Part-time learners and 28 instruc­
tors were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social
Sciences (SPSS). Statistical techniques like reliability anal­
ysis, was used to evaluate the quality of the questionnaire.

variables for every metric unit change in the independent
variable. The coefficient of perceived satisfaction is 0.775
represents the partial effect of perceived satisfaction on
adoption, holding the other variables as constant. Table3
reports the unstandardized estimate, its standard error
(S.E.), and the critical ratio (C.R.).
3.3  Level of Significance for Regression
As per table 4, the probability of getting a critical ratio
as large as 19.473 in absolute value is less than 0.001. In
other words, the regression weight for perceived satisfac­
tion in the prediction of adoption is significantly different
from zero at the 0.001 level (two-tailed).
3.4  Correlation Analysis on factors of ICT
on Adoption
The correlation coefficient between skills and infrastruc­
ture is 0.711. This indicates 71.1 percentage positive
relationships between skills and infrastructure on infra­
structure at 1% level. The correlation coefficient between
skills and support is 0.565. This indicates 56.5 percentage
positive relationships between skills and support and is
significant at 1% level. The correlation coefficient between
skills and support is 0.686. This indicates 68.6 percentage
positive relationships between skills and support and is
significant at 1% level and similarly the other factors are
positively correlated with each other (Table 5).
3.5  Finding and Suggestions
Among the three factors of ICT i.e. support, skills and
infrastructure, the factor most significantly ­impacting
As per the result shown in table 3, Chi square statistics
with p value of 0.358 which is greater than 0.05 shows
good fit of the model. The GFI and AGFI of this study was
0.984 which is more than the recommended value of 0.90
representing a good fit. The CFI value of 0.999 also means
a good fit. And the RMR = 0.069 and RMSEA=0.031 indi­
cate an absolute fit of the model. Goodness of fit indices
support the estimated model fit and these emphasized
indices indicate the acceptability of this structural model.

the perceived satisfaction of consumers is the ICT
­infrastructure followed by ICT skills and then the ICT
Support (Table9). ICT Support is provided by part-time
staffs but the consumers do not seem to have concerns on
the support timings (Table 6). As far as ICT Skills are con­
cerned, consumers strongly feel that insufficient skills to
take advantage of new technology is significant challenge.

out as the next significant challenge. Thereby there is a
demand from end users on need for continuous techni­
cal training (Table 7). Major concern from respondents
on the ICT infrastructure is about the anti-virus protec­
tion in their systems. High-speed internet connection
and multi-media incompatibility issues rank the next top
challenges (Table 8).

the perceived satisfaction of the learners and instructors
thereby significantly impacting the adoption levels of the
e-commerce offerings. The article explained about all the
e-commerce offerings for the purpose of academics. At
the same time the article handled how the ICT develop­
ments impact the adoption of the various offerings by
consumers.

4.  Conclusion
Conclusively, the article points out that ICT support, skills
and infrastructure majorly impact the perceived satisfac­
tion of consumer’s i.e. learners, instructors. As the current
state of ICT stands, as far as the in-campus support is con­
cerned, seems to be provided by staff who are involved
in part-time support for ICT. From the study, we get to
understand that there is a huge demand from the con­
sumers on a continuous need for training on the rapidly
changing technologies. Security aspect is known to cause
serious concern among consumers which prevents them
from adopting the e-commerce offerings. Overall, lack
of ICT skills, stands out as the major barrier impacting
