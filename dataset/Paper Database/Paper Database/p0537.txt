AIMS & METHODS:
Lung cancer is the 3rd most common cancer in France.1
↗incidence in women :

Medical treatment in cancer
deterioration in sexual
American women report :
o loss of stamina

DISCUSSION:
Sexuality of women with lung cancer is
undermined. They report significant
changes in their bodies and a breakdown
in their intimate relationships. They feel
the need to discuss it, but there are few
places within the hospital setting to
address this issue.
The limitations of this study include
the extremely small number of
participants and their lack of
diversity. This prevents data
saturation and only allows for a
preliminary response to the issue
addressed in our study.
Implementing
discussion groups on
this subject could be a
solution to address the
loneliness experienced
by patients.
Continued exploration of this
subject among diverse patient
profiles and integration into
broader research can provide
valuable insights and
connections to related issues.

Research implications:

that I avoid the moment of going to
bed. Honestly, I avoid it... Whereas

"I see all these [...] mothers

look like them! Everyone has their own life
journey, that's evident... but yeah, I don't
look like what I had in mind [...]
for myself at that age.”
