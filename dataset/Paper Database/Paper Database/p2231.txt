The energy use of an office building is likely to correlate
with the number of occupants, and thus knowing
occupancy levels should improve energy use forecasts.
To gather data related to total building occupancy,
wireless sensors were installed in a three-storey building
in eastern Ontario, Canada comprising laboratories and 81
individual work spaces. Contact closure sensors were
placed on various doors, PIR motion sensors were placed
in the main corridor on each floor, and a carbon-dioxide
sensor was positioned in a circulation area. In addition,
we collected data on the number of people who had
logged in to the network on each day, network activity,
electrical energy use (total building, and chilling plant
only), and outdoor temperature. We developed an
ARIMAX model to forecast the power demand of the
building in which a measure of building occupancy was a
significant independent variable and increased the model
accuracy. The results are promising, and suggest that
further work on a larger and more typical office building
would be beneficial. If building operators have a tool that
can accurately forecast the energy use of their building
several hours ahead they can better respond to utility price
signals, and play a fuller role in the coming Smart Grid.

1. INTRODUCTION
Energy costs are rising, and there is a growing trend
towards charging higher prices for energy when overall
system demand is highest, in order to better reflect the
true cost of generation, and to discourage on-peak use that
might threaten grid stability. A building’s ability to
reduce overall energy use and peak demand may be
substantial, depending on the systems in place and data
available to inform decisions, and tuning building power
draw in response to utility signals and other inputs may be
one element of the Smart Grid . As part of this
strategy a building operator may wish to explore and
manipulate building energy use a few hours ahead;
actions might involve load shedding, pre-cooling,
charging of ice storage, activation of local generation, or a
variety of other actions .
Building energy use data comprise a time series. In
recent decades a class of time series analysis models
named ARIMAX (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving
Average with eXternal (or eXogenous) input) has been
developed for forecasting in other domains, particularly in
economics . The “integrated” part of the name
indicates that it is often required that one runs the analysis
on the change in the dependent variable of interest
(known as “differencing”), to render the series
stationary1. “Auto regressive” indicates that the
forecasted value of the dependent variable may be
predicted from prior, known, values of the dependent
variable. “Moving average” indicates that the forecasted
value of the dependent variable may be predicted from
prior values of the error term. “External input” refers to
the optional use of independent predictors. The general
notation for such a model is ARIMAX(p,d,q); if
independent predictor variables are not employed then the
notation is ARIMA only. The “p” indicates how far back
in time one goes in using prior values of the variable of
interest. For example, if the current value of a variable
measured every hour is predicted using values of that

unchanging mean, and the variance over time is constant.
Stationary series are a requirement for ARIMA models.
variable from one and two hours ago (known as “lag 1”
and “lag 2”), p=2. Similarly, q refers to how many lags in
the error term are used and “d” indicates how many times
one takes the difference of the dependent variable. It is
often the case that the variable of interest exhibits obvious
periodic behaviour, generally referred to as “seasonal”
behaviour. For example, building power use often
displays a clear diurnal pattern; if one measures power
hourly then there will be a seasonality of order 24. For
modelling, one creates a new seasonal variable to reflect
this variation, which is the current value of the dependent
variable minus the value from one seasonal period ago.
One can then apply differencing and lags to this variable
and include these terms in the model. Thus the final
general notation is ARIMAX(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)s, where P, D,
and Q have the same meaning as above, but now refer to
the seasonal variable, and s is the order of seasonality
with respect to the measurement interval.

ARIMAX models have been applied to building-related
applications, including: modelling and forecasting of
room temperature , modelling of water and fuel use
in a variety of buildings , optimizing the operation of
cold storage in a large building , and forecasting and
controlling the peak demand for electricity at a
government complex .
Occupants are a key factor behind commercial building
energy use, due to use of office equipment, lighting, plug
loads, ventilation, thermal conditioning etc. Because
ARIMAX models use prior values of the dependent
variable, and because power use in a building is correlated
with occupancy, the auto regressive and moving average
components will implicitly carry the effect of occupancy.
The question we explored was whether including an
occupancy metric as an explicit independent variable
would improve model accuracy. In the authors
suggested that variance in their ARIMA model of indoor
temperature could be partially explained by variations in
occupancy, and in the authors lamented the lack of
occupancy data for use in their artificial neural network
model of building energy use.
In this study, our goal was not to compare ARIMA
models to other forecasting techniques, but to use an
ARIMA model as a platform for exploring the added
value of occupancy data. In certain buildings swipe card
access can easily give building occupancy information,
but where this is not used, are there other ways of
determining how many people are in a building?
2. METHODS & PROCEDURES
The study was conducted in a three-storey building in
eastern Ontario, Canada, comprising laboratories and 81
individual work spaces, and total serviced floor area of
5800 m2. Various wireless sensors were installed to
collect data on activities related to occupancy, and other
relevant information. Contact closure sensors were
placed on the two exterior doors used as primary entrance
and exit points, on two internal doors in common use, and
on the refrigerator door in the main break room. PIR
motion sensors were placed in the main corridor on each
floor, and a carbon-dioxide sensor was positioned in a
circulation area on the third floor. Wireless air
temperature and horizontal illuminance sensors were
positioned on the building’s roof to provide external
climate data. These sensors were all based on the
EnOcean platform. Repeater stations, with considerable
trial-and-error experimentation in their placement, were
required to deliver sensor data to the central receiver in a
reliable manner. In addition, we collected data on the
number of people who had logged in to the network on
each day (but not when they logged off), network activity
(bit transfer rates), and electrical energy use (total
building, and chiller separately). Detailed information on
the sensor system and data sources is available in .
2.1 Energy Use Forecasts Using ARIMAX
All variables used were hourly values (derived from
measurements at shorter time scales). The dataset
occupancy was virtually nil and our long term interest
was in peak demand load control.
We subtracted chiller power from total building power.
Thus the power variable included lighting, office
equipment, lab equipment, and other plug loads that were
likely directly related to occupancy, and thus perhaps of
more relevance to the goals of this study2 (in the
authors suggested that non-weather related energy use
would benefit from a separate analysis). Figure 1 shows
the average hourly values of this power variable. The
average peak load corresponds to ~46 W/m2, perhaps
double the typical value for a building comprising offices
only. An initial analysis suggested that network logins
and motion sensor counts were likely to be the most

suggested that using total building power including the
chiller yielded similar final results and conclusions.
useful measures of occupancy ( provides information
on all measures of occupancy, and the correlations
between them). Analysis showed using once-differenced
variables was appropriate for modelling purposes. Figure
2 shows average hourly values, and the expected rise (and
fall) of building power draw coincident with the rise (and
fall) of indicators of occupancy.

values more than 1.5 IQR from the end of the box; ‘*’
are outlier values more than 3 IQR from the end of the

outliers as defined above.
All analyses were conducted using the Forecasting
module in SPSS version 18. Some SPSS routines require
complete data sets, whereas we had some gaps in our data
due to imperfect data collection systems and subsequent
data cleaning. We had 79 days of complete and
continuous data for building power draw; of these 79
days, 5 complete days of network login data and 17
complete days of motion sensor data were missing and
were imputed with the mean of the non-missing values for
that hour and day of the week.
Data were available from 1 am on June 12th, 2009 (Week
1 Day 1 Hour 1) to midnight on September 30th, 2009
(Week 17 Day 3 Hour 24). Initial model exploration was
conducted on the majority of the dataset (Week 2 Day 1
Hour 1 to Week 16 Day 1 Hour 7), and checked for
robustness on a split sample. Finally, the model was used
to forecast power draw for the immediate future hours
(Week 16 Day 1 Hour 8 onwards) and compared to the
actual power draw data for this same period; i.e., data that
were not used in the derivation of the model.

building power minus chiller, unique network logins,

3. RESULTS
Initially we derived a model for building power on the
majority of the dataset without occupancy-related or other
predictors. We did try cooling degree hours (base 18 °C,
CDH18) for each hour (differenced) as a predictor to
check for residual climate dependence. CDH18 was
significant in the model but worsened the model fit. We
therefore decided on the pure ARIMA model as the base
model for comparison to later models. The automaticallygenerated, best fit model from SPSS Forecasting included
a lag 7 term. However, this did not have any obvious
physical explanation, and to keep the model compact we
dropped this term from the model; this had only a tiny
effect on the overall model fit. Therefore, the model was
ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)24, and Eq. 1 simplifies to:

The model parameters and fit statistics are shown in Table
1. For time-series data, stationary R-squared is a better
measure of variance explained than simple R-squared, and
higher values indicate a better fit. RMSE (Root Mean
Square Error), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error),
MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MaxAPE (Maximum
Absolute Percentage Error), MaxAE (Maximum Absolute
Error) are all measures where lower values indicate better
performance. Normalized BIC (Bayesian Information)
accounts for the number of parameters used in the model,
and may penalize non-compact models; lower values
indicate better model performance.

In the next step we added login data as a predictor in the
model, using the Transfer Function option in SPSS
Forecasting. Logins were significant in the model. The
final model was ARIMAX(0,1,1)(0,1,1)24, and Eq. 1 thus
simplifies to:

The model parameters and fit statistics shown are shown

compared to Table 1, albeit by relatively small amounts.

We tried adding motion sensor data as a predictor instead
of logins, but this predictor was not statistically
significant and did not improve the model.
We explored model robustness by specifying the model
form in Table 2 to a split sample (Week 2 Day 1 Hour 1
to Week 10 Day 5 Hour 24; and, Week 11 Day 1 Hour 1
to Week 16 Day 5 Hour 24). All three model parameters
from Table 2 were significant in both split samples, and
the parameter estimates were similar.
We then used the model from Table 2 to forecast building
power into the future, using the methods in the SPSS
Forecasting module. Note, that using the final model
equation (Eq. 3), to forecast the value of Yt൅ͳ requires
Xt൅ͳ. In this case, Xt൅ͳ is unknown a priori, and therefore
it too must be forecast in some manner. This may be
done with a separate ARIMA model for X alone .
The model in Table 2 was used in a forecast for the
remainder of Week 16 Day 1 (a Monday). Figure 3
shows the forecast made at Hour 7 for the remainder of
the day, and the actual building power. For comparison
we chose two simple forecasts that might commonly be
invoked: the average for all weekdays in the sample up to
Week 15 Day 5; and the values from Week 15 Day 1 (the
previous Monday). Beyond Hour 7 the ARIMAX model
tends to under-predict the building power draw,
forecasting a peak load 20 kW lower than the actual peak.
The RMSE for Hours 8 to 24 are shown in Table 3.
Overall, the ARIMAX model performs better than
assuming values from the previous Monday, but slightly
worse that assuming average values from all weekdays.

ARIMAX model (at Hour 7, and hour-ahead
forecasts to Hour 13), compared to: actual power;
average for all weekdays; the previous Monday.
It is common practice to update ARIMAX models as new
data become available . We recalculated the
model at every hour after Hour 7, and restricted ourselves
to one-hour ahead forecasts; Figure 3 also shows the
aggregate one-hour ahead forecasts up to Hour 13, and the
forecast out to Hour 24 using the model updated at Hour
13. In this mode the RMSE is 73% lower than that from
the average of all previous weekdays.

4. DISCUSSION
The improvement in the ARIMAX model with logins as a
predictor was small but encouraging. There were several
reasons why small effects might prevail in this building,
and why we could expect a larger effect in a more typical
office building. First, the study building had a high
fraction of process loads for laboratory equipment, and a

relatively lower fraction of loads related to the arrival and
departure of occupants. This building was not unusual for
its type, building power and occupancy profiles for a
university computer science building were very
similar to those in our study building. In a building
power profile for a more typical office building , the
peak power draw was similar to our study building, but
the overnight power draw was only 20% of this peak.
Second, we expect that if logouts were also known in
addition to logins, the model would be improved.
Motion sensor data did not improve our model. Perhaps
this was because there was more variability in this
parameter, or that it had less of a direct connection to
occupancy than logins (i.e. logging in requires switching
on a load, a computer, whereas activating a motion sensor
does not). It might also simply be an artefact of the
modelling process. Also, recall that a relatively large
number of days of data were missing for this variable and
had to be imputed, thus reducing the explanatory power.
None of the other occupancy measures were effective in
the model. Again, it would be interesting to explore
whether such data streams were more effective in a more
conventional office building. Further, the sensors and
data streams we selected were a convenience sample from
a wider possible range, other sensors might prove
valuable (e.g. cameras, pressure sensors, noise data).
Future development should explore robustness over
longer time periods, through changing patterns of energy
use throughout a year, and in a variety of building types.
