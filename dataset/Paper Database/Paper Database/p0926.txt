ABSTRACT New advances in electronic commerce systems and communication technologies have made
the credit card the potentially most popular method of payment for both regular and online purchases; thus,
there is signiﬁcantly increased fraud associated with such transactions. Fraudulent credit card transactions
cost ﬁrms and consumers large ﬁnancial losses every year, and fraudsters continuously attempt to ﬁnd new
technologies and methods for committing fraudulent transactions. The detection of fraudulent transactions
has become a signiﬁcant factor affecting the greater utilization of electronic payment. Thus, there is a need
for efﬁcient and effective approaches for detecting fraud in credit card transactions. This paper proposes
an intelligent approach for detecting fraud in credit card transactions using an optimized light gradient
boosting machine (OLightGBM). In the proposed approach, a Bayesian-based hyperparameter optimization
algorithm is intelligently integrated to tune the parameters of a light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM).
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed OLightGBM for detecting fraud in credit card transactions,
experiments were performed using two real-world public credit card transaction data sets consisting of
fraudulent transactions and legitimate ones. Based on a comparison with other approaches using the two
data sets, the proposed approach outperformed the other approaches and achieved the highest performance
in terms of accuracy (98.40%), Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (92.88%), Precision
(97.34%) and F1-score (56.95%).

I. INTRODUCTION
THE MIGRATION The migration of business to the Internet and the electronic monetary transactions that occur in
the continuously growing cash-less economy have made the
accurate detection of fraud a signiﬁcant factor in securing
such transactions. Credit card fraud occurs when a thief uses
credit card information to complete purchase processes without permission from the credit card owner.
The large-scale use of credit cards and the lack of effective
security systems result in billion-dollar losses to credit card
fraud . Because credit card ﬁrms are typically unwilling
to announce such facts, it is difﬁcult to obtain a precise
approximation of the losses. However, certain data regarding

the ﬁnancial losses caused by credit card fraud are publicly
accessible. The use of credit cards without strong security
causes billion-dollar ﬁnancial losses . Global ﬁnancial
losses due to credit card fraud amounted to 22.8 billion US
dollars in 2017 and are expected to continuously increase ;
by 2020, the number is expected to reach 31 billion US
dollars .
There are two categories of credit card fraud: application
fraud and behavior fraud . Application fraud refers to
fraudulent credit card applications. Such fraud occurs when a
fraudster initiates a new credit card process using false identity details and the issuer accepts the request. Behavior fraud
occurs after a credit card is correctly issued and denotes credit
card transactions that involve fraudulent behavior. Credit card
fraud detection has been signiﬁcant issue for credit card
users and ﬁnancial organizations. Because detecting even a

small number of fraudulent transactions would protect large
amounts of money, credit card fraud has also become a signiﬁcant problem for researchers.
For various reasons, fraud detection is considered a challenge for machine learning because, for example, the distribution of data continually evolves over time due to new
attack approaches and seasonality and because a very small
percentage of all credit card transactions are fraudulent.
This paper proposes an intelligent approach for detecting
fraudulent credit card transactions that uses an optimized
light gradient boosting machine. In the proposed approach,
a Bayesian-based hyperparameter optimization algorithm is
intelligently integrated to tune the parameters of the light gradient boosting machine algorithm. The proposed approach is
primarily concerned with discriminating between legitimate
and fraudulent credit card transactions.
The main contribution of our research is an intelligent
approach for detecting fraud in credit card transactions using
an optimized light gradient boosting machine in which a
Bayesian-based hyperparameter optimization algorithm is
utilized to optimize the parameters of the light gradient boosting machine. The performance of the proposed intelligent
approach is evaluated based on two real-world data sets and
compared with other machine learning techniques using performance evaluation metrics.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Related
research is reviewed in the second section. Section three
describes our proposed intelligent approach for credit card
fraud detection, and in section four, the results of experiments
are discussed. Finally, the study’ s conclusions are summarized in section ﬁve.
II. RELATED WORK
The potential social and economic importance of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions has increased the
number of relevant research efforts in the literature. This
section reviews several signiﬁcant studies. More comprehensive reviews can be found in – .
There are two main approaches for detecting fraudulent
credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms:
supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning
algorithms. In supervised learning algorithms, historical
credit card transactions are labeled as legitimate or fraudulent. Then, supervised learning algorithms start learning
using these data to create a model that can be used to categorize new data samples. In contrast, unsupervised learning
algorithms are based on the direct classiﬁcation of credit card
transactions using patterns that are considered normal. Then,
the algorithm classiﬁes transactions that do not conform to
such patterns as fraudulent credit card transactions.
Both supervised learning , and unsupervised learning algorithms have been utilized for credit card fraud
detection. The most popular algorithms for the detection of
credit card fraud use supervised learning and employ labeled
transactions for classiﬁer training. Fraudulent credit card
transactions are detected by classifying features extracted
from credit card transactions .
A number of classiﬁcation algorithms have been utilized
to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. A probabilistic
neural network (PNN), logistic regression (LOR) and genetic
programming (GP) have been employed for classifying fraud
in credit card transactions . A data set of 202 Chinese
ﬁrms was used, and t-statistics were applied to select the
important features. The results revealed that PNN outperformed the other approaches . Bayesian belief networks
(BNNs) and decision trees (DTs) were used in to detect
fraud in ﬁnancial transactions. Here, a data set of ﬁnancial
transactions collected from 76 Greek industrial companies
was used. The data set included 38 ﬁnancial transactions
conﬁrmed to be fraudulent by assessors. The BNNs obtained
the highest accuracy (90.3%), whereas the DTs achieved an
accuracy of 73.6% .
A self-organizing map (SOM) was used to generate a
model for unsupervised credit card fraud detection. The
advantages of this method are that because the SOM model
does not require prior information, the model is updated
continuously by adding new credit card transactions; the
disadvantage may be the difﬁculty of detecting fraudulent
credit card transactions with high accuracy – .
Recently, deep learning has become a powerful component
of machine learning and achieved promising results in several
ﬁelds, such as image processing . Jurgovsky et al. 
utilized a long short-term memory (LSTM) frame to detect
credit card fraud as a sequence classiﬁcation issue in the
supervised learning category. Kraus and Feuerriegel 
utilized deep-learning approaches to support ﬁnancial decisions. Fiore et al. proposed a scheme to make synthetic instances based on generative adversarial networks to
enhance credit card fraud detection performance by solving
the issue of the imbalanced data set.
Carcillo et al. implemented a hybrid approach that utilizes unsupervised outlier scores to expand the set of features
of the fraud detection classiﬁer. Their main contribution was
to implement and assess various levels of granularity for outlier score deﬁnition. Their experimental results indicate that
their proposed approach is efﬁcient and enhances detection
Carcillo et al. also introduced the SCAlable Real-time
Fraud Finder (SCARFF), which incorporates big-data techniques (Cassandra, Kafka and Spark) in a machine learning
method to address nonstationarity, imbalance, and feedback
latency. The results of experiments based on a large data set of
real credit card transactions demonstrated that the framework
is efﬁcient, accurate and scalable.
Saia and Carta proposed a new approach to credit card
fraud detection based on a model deﬁned using a discrete
Fourier transform converted to utilize frequency patterns. The
approach has the advantages of treating imbalanced class
distribution and cold-start issues by considering only past
legitimate transactions, thus decreasing the data heterogeneity problem.

Yuan et al. introduced a novel framework that combines deep neural networks and spectral graph analysis for
fraud detection. They developed and assessed two neural
networks for fraud detection: a deep auto encoder and a
convolutional neural network. Experimental results indicated
that their proposed approach is effective for fraud detection.
In , Saia presented a novel credit card fraud detection
method based on the discrete wavelet transform, which was
utilized to construct an evaluation model capable of overcoming problems related to the imbalanced distribution of
credit card fraud data sets. The experimental results indicated that the performance of the proposed approach was
comparable to that of state-of-the-art approaches, such as
random forests. West and Bhattacharya presented a comprehensive review of ﬁnancial fraud detection approaches
using computational intelligence techniques. In addition, they
identiﬁed research gaps that were not addressed by other
review articles.
Ensemble classiﬁers associate what is currently learned
from new samples from previously attained knowledge.
Dhankhad et al. applied many supervised machine
learning algorithms to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using a real-world data set. Then, they used
these algorithms to implement a super classiﬁer based
on ensemble learning approaches. Their results indicated
that the ensemble approach achieved the best performance.
Dal Pozzolo et al. designed two fraud detection systems
based on an ensemble method and a sliding-window method,
respectively. The study revealed that the winning strategy
involved training two separate classiﬁers and then aggregating the outcomes. Based on experiments on a large data set,
the results indicated that the proposed approach improved
fraud alert precision.
Bio-inspired algorithms offer global solutions to the optimization problems. The combining bio-inspired optimization algorithms with machine learning models may enhance
the performances of the machine learning models because
it has the ability to deduct the best solutions for the optimization problem. Therefore, machine learning models have
been coupled with bio-inspired optimization techniques,

III. PROPOSED INTELLIGENT APPROACH FOR CREDIT
CARD FRAUD DETECTION
The overall framework of the proposed intelligent approach
for credit card fraud detection is illustrated in ﬁgure 1.
intelligent
fraud detection consists of four major steps, which are
explained in the following subsections. The experiment
was performed using an Intel Core i7 processor with
8GB RAM. The proposed approach and other machine
learning techniques were implemented and tested using
FIGURE 1. Overall framework of the proposed intelligent approach for
credit card fraud detection.
TABLE 1. Summary of the analyzed data sets.
A. DATA SET AND DATA PREPROCESSING
To develop different experiments for evaluating the proposed
approach and demonstrating its generality, we consider two
different real-world data sets.
The ﬁrst data set consists of 284,807 credit card transactions made by the credit card owners in September 2013 in
Europe. Of the 284,807 transactions in the data set, 492 were
fraudulent; the positive class (i.e., the fraudulent transactions) represents 0.172% of all transactions . The data set
includes 31 features. The ﬁrst 28 features (i.e., V1 to V28)
are the principal components obtained using principal components analysis (PCA). The basic reason is to maintain data
privacy. ‘‘Time’’ and ‘‘Amount’’ are the only two features that
are not transformed using PCA.
The second data set is the UCSD-FICO Data Mining Contest 2009 Dataset , which is a real data set
of e-commerce transactions. The objective was to detect
anomalous e-commerce transactions. The data set consists
of 94,683 transactions, 2,094 of which are fraudulent. The
data set was collected from 73,729 credit cards during a
period of 98 days. It contains 20 ﬁelds, including class, and
the ﬁelds labels are as follows: amount, hour1, state1, zip1,
custAttr1, ﬁeld1, custAttr2, ﬁeld2, hour2, ﬂag1, total, ﬁeld3,
ﬁeld4, indicator1, indicator2, ﬂag2, ﬂag3, ﬂag4, ﬂag5, and
Class. The Class feature in the two data sets is the classiﬁcation variable, which is 1 in the case of credit card fraud
and 0 otherwise. The data sets are summarized in table 1,
where we present the total number of transactions, the number
of legitimate transactions, the number of fraudulent transactions, the number of features in the data set and the references
for downloading each data set.
Because the total number of fraudulent transactions is
much less than the number of legitimate transactions, the data

distribution is unbalanced, i.e., skewed towards legitimate
observations. It is well known that the performance of various
machine learning methods decreases when the analyzed data
set is unbalanced . To obtain more accurate results, a cross
validation procedure is employed in this paper to train and
test the model in each subset of the two data sets; then,
the average of all the noted metrics is calculated over the data
set . Other techniques, such as resampling, have also been
suggested to address imbalanced data sets .
B. FEATURE SELECTION
Selecting signiﬁcant and important features is critical for the
effective detection of credit card fraud when the number of
features is large . LightGBM utilizes the information gain (IG) method to select the most important features
and thus decrease the dimensionality of the training data.
Information gain functions by extracting similarities between
credit card transactions and then awarding the greatest weight
to the most signiﬁcant features based on the class of legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions. Because of its
computational efﬁciency and leading performance in terms
of precision , information gain is employed as a feature
selection method in the proposed approach.
C. THE OPTIMIZED LIGHT GRADIENT BOOST CLASSIFIER
This section explains the proposed intelligent approach
for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using an
optimized light gradient boosting framework based on tree
learning algorithms. In the proposed approach, a Bayesianbased hyperparameter optimization algorithm is intelligently
integrated to tune the parameters of the LightGBM algorithm.
The high-performance LightGBM algorithm can quickly
handle large amounts of data and the distributed processing of
data. It was developed as an open source project by Microsoft.
in ﬁgure 2.
The LightGBM algorithm includes several parameters,
termed hyper parameters. The hyper parameters have a signiﬁcant impact on the performance of LightGBM algorithm.
They are typically set manually and then tuned in a continuous trial and error process. In this paper, a Bayesian based
hyperparameter optimization algorithm is intelligently integrated in the proposed approach to tune the hyper parameters
of the LightGBM algorithm. The tuned hyper parameters
include the following: ‘‘num_leaves’’, which is the number of
leaves per tree, ‘‘max_depth’’, which denotes the maximum
depth of the tree, and ‘‘learning_rate’’.
The proposed approach is based on the LightGBM algorithm, which can bundle unique features into a single bundle; then, the feature-scanning algorithm can be considered
for creating same-feature histograms based on the feature
bundles . The computation complexity of the proposed
approach was calculated based on theoretical time complexity as follows: computation complexity = (n∗m), where m
denotes the number of data set samples, and m denotes the
number of bundles that is less than the number of features in
FIGURE 2. The LightGBM algorithm.
the data set. LightGBM uses the gradient-based one side sampling (GOSS) method to preserve the accuracy of the information gain estimation; GOSS retains instances with large
gradients (e.g., larger than a predeﬁned threshold or those
among the top percentiles) and randomly samples those
instances with small gradients .
D. MODEL EVALUATION USING PERFORMANCE METRICS
To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach for
credit card fraud detection, a cross validation test is applied.
The k-fold cross-validation (CV) method is utilized to systematically and carefully assess the performance of the
proposed approach for credit card fraud detection. K-Fold
CV is a statistical analysis approach that has been widely
employed by researchers to assess the performance of the
machine learning classiﬁer . In this research, we conduct
a 5-fold CV test to assess the performance of the proposed
approach. The two analyzed data sets have imbalance in
classes: there are more normal than fraudulent transactions.
In this case, to achieve more accurate estimates, cross validation is used to train and test the model in each subset of
the two data sets; then, the average of all the noted metrics is
calculated over the data set .
Each data set is divided randomly into ﬁve separate subsets
of equal size. At each step of validation, a single subset
(20% of the data set) is reserved as the validation data set for
testing the performance of the proposed approach, while the
remaining four subsets (80% of the data set) are employed
as the training data set. This process is then repeated ﬁve
VOLUME 8, 2020

times until each subset has been used. The average of the
performances of the ﬁve test subsets is calculated, and the
ﬁnal result is the total performance of the proposed approach
on a 5-fold CV test.
To assess the performance of the proposed approach,
several measures are considered, including the Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, Accuracy (ACC), AUC and
F1-score. The metrics are deﬁned based on the confusion
The Confusion Matrix for measuring credit card fraud
detection performance uses the following terms :
TP (i.e., true positive) refers to the number of fraudulent
credit card transactions properly classiﬁed.
FP (i.e., false positive) denotes the number of legitimate
fraud credit card transactions classiﬁed as fraud. FN (i.e.,
false negative) denotes the number of fraudulent credit card
transactions classiﬁed as normal. TN (i.e., true negative)
refers to the number of normal credit card transactions correctly classiﬁed. The measures that were used are deﬁned as
Accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN)
Recall = TP/(TP + FN)
Precision = TP/(TP + FP)
F1−measure = 2×(Precision×Recall)/(Precision + Recall)
Precision and Recall are important metrics used with unbalanced data when combined together (i.e.,F-score). Precision
indicates the correctness of the suitability of the result scale
and proximity to the expected solution, while Recall is a
measure of the number of relevant results. A high Recall
score reﬂects a low false negative (FN) rate, while high
Precision reﬂects a low false positive (FP) rate. High scores
for Precision and Recall indicate that the classiﬁer restores
results with high accuracy and recovers most of the positive
results . Therefore, the Precision-Recall curve reveals a
complete picture of the accuracy of the classiﬁer and is robust
even in an imbalanced data set . We consider the AUC
value as a general performance measure in addition to the
above measures. AUC is a graphical plot of the false positive rate (FPR) and the true positive rate (TPR) at different
possible levels. Because it is independent of a cutoff value,
AUC is considered a better overall performance indicator than
accuracy. A model with better overall performance has an
AUC value close to one.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for
credit card fraud detection, the 5-fold CV procedure is conducted using two real-world data sets. The proposed approach
is trained with parameters optimized using the Bayesianbased hyperparameter optimization algorithm.
Table 2 shows a performance evaluation of the proposed
approach based on the 5-fold CV procedure using the two
real-world data sets. To obtain a reliable performance comparison, the cross validation procedure is employed because it

5-fold cross validation using two real-world data sets.
uses each data set part (i.e., fold) for testing and training processes. The proposed approach achieved average AUC values
of 90.94% and 92.90% for data set 1 and data set 2, respectively, which indicates the ability of the proposed approach in
distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent credit card
transactions. In addition, the proposed approach achieved an
average accuracy of 0.98% for the two data sets, which is the
ratio of correctly predicted credit card transactions to the total
number of transactions. Attaining the same accuracy score
using two different data sets indicates the considerable consistency of the proposed approach. The proposed approach
also obtained average Recall scores of 40.59% and 28.33%
for data set 1 and data set 2, respectively, which indicates the
ability of the proposed approach to correctly detect more than
40% of the suspicious credit card transactions with a low false
negative percentage in data set 1. In addition, the proposed
approach achieved average Precision scores of 97.34% and
91.72% for data set 1 and data set 2, respectively, which
is the ratio of correctly classiﬁed fraudulent transactions to
classiﬁed fraudulent transactions. In addition, the proposed
approach achieved average F1-scores of 56.95% and 43.27%
for data set 1 and data set 2, respectively. The F1-score indicates the balance between Precision and Recall. Therefore,
this score takes both false negatives and false positives into
account. It is an important measure, particularly if the number
of legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions is not
balanced. The overall performance of the proposed approach
is highly consistent based on the 5-fold CV procedure using
the two data sets. Using cross validation, the data set 1 results
based on the various performance metrics are highly consistent with the results for data set 2.
For better visualization of the performance evaluation
results, the AUC curves based on the 5-fold cross validation
procedure using the two data set metrics were plotted in line
charts, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. The Recall-Precision
curves are presented in Fig. 5 and Fig.6.
To further evaluate its performance and robustness, the proposed approach is compared with state-of-the-art machine
algorithms,

and 82.14% for data set 1 and data set 2, respectively.
The proposed approach achieved the highest Precision
scores: 97.34% and 91.72% for data set 1 and data set 2,
respectively. In addition, the proposed approach attained the
highest F1-score (56.95% for data set 1), while the RF algorithm achieved an F1-score of 45.45% for data set 2, slightly
outperforming the proposed approach, which achieved an
F1-score of 43.27% for the same data set.
The AUC curve is an important and useful estimation of
overall performance and a general measure of the accuracy of
fraud investigation . A higher AUC curve indicates better
prediction performance.

approach and other machine learning algorithms for the two

is located nearest to the ﬁgures’ top-left corner, suggesting
that the proposed approach for credit card fraud detection
achieved better performance for the two data sets. Overall,

V. CONCLUSION
The detection of credit card fraud is signiﬁcant to the
improved utilization of credits cards. With large and continuing ﬁnancial losses being experienced by ﬁnancial ﬁrms
and given the increasing difﬁculty of detecting credit card
fraud, it is important to develop more effective approaches
for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.
This paper proposes an intelligent approach for detecting
fraud in credit card transactions using an optimized light
gradient boosting machine (OLightGBM). We conducted
several experiments using two real-world data sets. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated through
comparison with other research outcomes and state-of-the-art
machine learning algorithms, including random forest, logistic regression, the radial support vector machine, the linear
support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree,
and naive bayes. The experimental results indicate that the
proposed approach outperformed the other machine learning
algorithms and achieved the highest performance in terms of
Accuracy, AUC, Precision and F1-score. The results reveal
that the proposed algorithm is superior to other classiﬁers.
The results also highlight the importance and value of adopting an efﬁcient parameter optimization strategy for enhancing
the predictive performance of the proposed approach.
