Hubble constant. We summarize our method, the results, and the uncertainties, tabulate our revised distances, and give the implications of these results for cosmology. Our results are based on a Cepheid
calibration of several secondary distance methods applied over the range of about 60È400 Mpc. The
analysis presented here beneÐts from a number of recent improvements and reÐnements, including (1) a
larger LMC Cepheid sample to deÐne the Ðducial period-luminosity (PL) relations, (2) a more recent
Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) photometric calibration, (3) a correction for
Cepheid metallicity, and (4) a correction for incompleteness bias in the observed Cepheid PL samples.
We adopt a distance modulus to the LMC (relative to which the more distant galaxies are measured) of
mag, or 50 kpc. New, revised distances are given for the 18 spiral galaxies for

at the current epoch. More than seven decades have now
passed since Hubble initially published the correlation between the distances to galaxies and their recession
velocities, thereby providing evidence for the expansion of
the universe. But pinning down an accurate value for the
Hubble constant has proved extremely challenging. There
are many reasons for this difficulty, but primary among
them is the basic difficulty of establishing accurate distances
over cosmologically signiÐcant scales.
The Hubble constant enters in a practical way into
numerous cosmological and astrophysical calculations. Its
sets the age of the universe,
and the size of
the observable universe,
given a knowledge of
Robs \ ct0,
the total energy density of the universe. The square of the
Hubble constant relates the total energy density of the universe to its geometry .
In addition, the Hubble constant deÐnes the critical density

further speciÐes the epoch in the universe at which the
density of matter and radiation were equal, so that the
growth of structure in the universe is also dependent on
the expansion rate. The determination of many physical
properties of galaxies and quasars (e.g., mass, luminosity,
energy density) all require knowledge of the Hubble constant, as does the proportion of primordial light elements
(H, D, 3He, 4He, and Li) synthesized in the Ðrst few minutes
after the big bang.
Measuring an accurate value of

vating reasons for building the NASA/ESA Hubble Space
Telescope (HST ). Thus, in the mid 1980s, measurement of

three ““ Key Projects ÏÏ of the HST , and teams from the
astronomical community were encouraged to propose to
undertake these initiatives.16 A team headed by the late
Marc Aaronson began preparing our proposal in 1984; following peer review , our group was awarded the Key Project on the
Extragalactic Distance Scale in 1986. Very sadly, Marc met
a tragic and untimely death in 1987. We began our initial
observations of the closest galaxies in our sample in 1991,
shortly after the launch of HST , but most of the project was
carried out after the refurbishment mission , when a new camera with optics that corrected
for the spherical aberration of the primary mirror was
installed.
The overall goal of the
Key Project (hereafter simply
the Key Project) was to measure
based on a Cepheid
calibration of a number of independent, secondary distance
determination methods. Given the history of systematic
errors dominating the accuracy of distance measurements,
the approach we adopted was to avoid relying on a single
method alone, and instead to average over the systematics
by calibrating and using a number of di†erent methods.
Determining
accurately requires the measurement of
distances far enough away that both the small- and largescale motions of galaxies become small compared to the
overall Hubble expansion. To extend the distance scale
beyond the range of the Cepheids, a number of methods
that provide relative distances were chosen. We have used
the HST Cepheid distances to provide an absolute distance
scale for these otherwise independent methods, including
the Type Ia supernovae, the Tully-Fisher relation, the fundamental plane for elliptical galaxies, surface brightness
Ñuctuations, and Type II supernovae.
The previous 29 papers in this series have provided the
distances to individual galaxies based on the discovery and
measurement of Cepheids, discussed the calibration of the
data, presented interim results on the Hubble constant, and
provided the calibration of secondary methods, along with
their individual determinations of the Hubble constant. A
recent paper by Mould et al. combines the results
for secondary methods 
with a weighting scheme based on numerical simulations of
the uncertainties. In this paper, we present the Ðnal, combined results of the Key Project. This analysis beneÐts from
signiÐcant recent reÐnements and improvements to the
Cepheid period-luminosity relation, as well as the HST
WFPC2 photometric scale, and puts all of the data for the
Key Project and other e†orts onto a new common zero
point. Establishing plausible limits for the Hubble constant
requires a careful investigation of systematic errors. We
explicitly note where current limits in accuracy have been
reached. We intend this paper to provide an assessment of
the status of the global value of H0.
In this paper, we summarize our method and determination of Cepheid distances in ° 2 and ° 3. In ° 4 and ° 5, we
apply a correction for the nearby Ñow Ðeld and compare the
obtained locally with that determined at greater
distances. Secondary methods and the determination of H0

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE KEY PROJECT
2.1. Goals
The main aims of the Key Project were (1) to use the high resolving power of HST
to discover Cepheids in, and determine distances to, a
sample of nearby
Mpc) galaxies, and establish an
accurate local distance scale; (2) to determine
ing the Cepheid calibration to several secondary distance
indicators operating farther out in the Hubble Ñow; (3) to
intercompare the Cepheid and other distances to provide
estimates of the external uncertainties for all the methods;
and (4) to conduct tests of the universality of the Cepheid
period-luminosity relation, in particular as a function of
metal abundance. Finally, an ancillary aim was to measure
Cepheid distances to a small number of galaxies in each of
the two nearest clusters (Virgo and Fornax) as an independent check on other Hubble constant determinations.
Why was HST necessary for an accurate determination
Atmospheric seeing sets the practical limit for
resolving Cepheids and measuring well-deÐned periodluminosity relations to only a few megaparsecs. The superb
and essentially nonvarying image quality of HST extends
that limit tenfold, and the e†ective search volume a thousandfold. Furthermore, HST o†ers a unique capability in
that it can be scheduled optimally to facilitate the discovery
of Cepheid variables. Observations can be scheduled independently of the phase of the Moon, the time of day, or
weather, and there are no seeing variations. Before the
launch of HST , most Cepheid searches were conÐned to our
own Local Group of galaxies and the very nearest surrounding groups . At that
time, only Ðve galaxies with well-measured Cepheid distances provided the absolute calibration of the Tully-Fisher
relation and a single Cepheid distance,
that for M31, provided the calibration for the surface
brightness Ñuctuation method . Moreover,
before HST no Cepheid calibrators were available for Type
Ia supernovae (although one historical, nearby Type Ia
supernova, SN 1885A, had been observed in M31).
2.2. Choice of Target Galaxies and Observing Strategy
In each nearby target spiral galaxy in the Key Project
sample, Cepheid searches were undertaken in regions active
in star formation, but low in apparent dust extinction,
based on ground-based, photographic images . To the largest extent possible, we avoided
high surface brightness regions in order to minimize source
confusion or crowding. For each galaxy, over a 2 month
time interval, HST images in the visual (V band, 5550 A ),
and in the near-infrared (I band, 8140
were made using
(WFPC2). Among the galaxies on the Key Project observing program, only M81 and an outer Ðeld in M101 were
observed with the original Wide Field/Planetary camera
(WF/PC), before the Ðrst HST servicing mission that re-

stored the telescope capabilities. Two of the Type Ia supernova calibrators investigated by the Sandage et al. team and
rediscussed here were also observed with WF/PC: IC 4182
and NGC 5253. The Ðeld of view of the WFC2 is L-shaped,
with each of the three cameras covering

sky, and the PC 35@@ ] 35@@.
For the observations, two wavelength bands were chosen
to enable corrections for dust extinction, following the precepts of Freedman and Madore & Freedman .
Initially, during the observing window, 12 epochs at V
(F555W) and four observations at I (F814W) were obtained.
For some of the galaxies observed early in the program,
some B (F439W) data were also obtained. For the targets
observed later in the program, observations were obtained
at both V and I at each of the 12 epochs. An additional
observation was generally made one year earlier or later, to
increase the time baseline and reduce aliasing errors, particularly for the longer period stars. The time distribution of
the observations was set to follow a power law, enabling the
detection and measurement of Cepheids with a range of
periods optimized for minimum aliasing between 10 and 50
days .
Since each individual secondary method is likely to be
a†ected by its own (independent) systematic uncertainties,
to reach a Ðnal overall uncertainty of ^10%, the numbers
of calibrating galaxies for a given method were chosen initially so that the Ðnal (statistical) uncertainty on the zero
point for that method would be only D5%. (In practice,
however, some methods end up having higher weight than
other methods, owing to their smaller intrinsic scatter, as
well as how far out into the Hubble Ñow they can be
applied; see ° 7). In Table 1, each method is listed with its
mean dispersion, the numbers of Cepheid calibrators preand post-HST , and the standard error of the mean. (We
note that the fundamental plane for elliptical galaxies
cannot be calibrated directly by Cepheids; this method was
not included in our original proposal, and it has the largest
uncertainties. As described in ° 6.3, it is calibrated by the
Cepheid distances to three nearby groups and clusters.) The
calibration of Type Ia supernovae was part of the original
Key Project proposal, but time for this aspect of the
program was awarded to a team led by Allan Sandage.
For the Key Project, Cepheid distances were obtained for
17 galaxies chosen to provide a calibration for secondary
methods and a determination of
These galaxies lie at
distances between 3 and 25 Mpc. They are located in the
general Ðeld, in small groups (for example, the M81 and the
Leo I groups at 3 and 10 Mpc, respectively), and in major
clusters (Virgo and Fornax). An additional target, the
nearby spiral galaxy M101, was chosen to enable a test of
the e†ects of metallicity on the Cepheid period-luminosity
relation. HST has also been used to measure Cepheid distances to six galaxies targeted speciÐcally to be useful for
the calibration of Type Ia supernovae

2.3. Key Project Archival Database
As part of our original time allocation request for the Key
Project, we proposed to provide all of our data in an
archive that would be accessible to the general astronomical
community. We envisaged that the Cepheid distances
obtained as part of the Key Project would provide a database useful for the calibration of many secondary methods,
including those that might be developed in the future. For
each galaxy observed as part of the Key Project, the
Cepheid positions, magnitudes, and periods are available
electronically from the Key Project.18 In addition, photometry for nonvariable stars that can be used for photometry
comparisons, as well as medianed (nonphotometric) images
for these galaxies, are also available. These images are also
archived in NED.19
2.4. Photometry
As a means of guarding against systematic errors speciÐcally in the data-reduction phase, each galaxy within the
Key Project was analyzed by two independent groups
within the team, each using di†erent software packages:
DoPHOT and ALLFRAME . The latter
software was developed speciÐcally for the optimal analysis
of data sets like those of the Key Project, consisting of large
numbers of observations of a single target Ðeld. Only at the
end of the data-reduction process (including the Cepheid
selection and distance determinations) were the two groupsÏ
results intercompared. This ““ double-blind ÏÏ procedure
proved extremely valuable. First, it allowed us to catch
simple (operator) errors. It also enabled us to provide a
more realistic estimate of the external data reduction errors
for each galaxy distance. The limit to the accuracy of the
photometry that can be obtained in these galaxy Ðelds is set
by the sky (i.e., unresolved galaxy) background in the
frames, and, ultimately, the difficulty in determining aperture corrections. Each of the two packages deals with sky
determination and aperture corrections in di†erent ways,
thereby providing a means of evaluating this systematic

which Cepheid observations have been taken in cycle 9 (GO-8322).

uncertainty in the Cepheid photometry. As discussed in
° 8.5, we also undertook a series of artiÐcial star tests to
better quantify the e†ects of crowding, and to understand
the limits in each of these software packages and Kelson
et al. for WF/PC and Hill et al. , Stetson ,
and Mould et al. for WFPC2.
As part of an HST program to study Galactic globular
clusters, but also extremely valuable for the photometric
calibration of WFPC2, hundreds of images of u Cen, NGC
2419, and M92 have been obtained both on the ground and
with HST over the last several years . Despite this extensive e†ort, the calibration of
WFPC2 remains a signiÐcant source of systematic uncertainty in the determination of
This lingering uncer-
tainty results from the difficulty in characterizing the
charge-transfer efficiency (CTE) properties of the WFPC2,
which turn out to be a complicated function of position on
the chip, the brightness of the object, the brightness of the
sky, and the wavelength of the observations .
Recent WFPC2 calibrations di†er from our earlier calibration based on Hill et al.
 . Based on the reference-star photometry published in
Papers IV to XXI in the Key Project series, Mould et al.
 found that the reddening-corrected distance moduli
on the Stetson system were 0.07 ^ 0.02 mag closer, in
the mean, than those published based on the Hill et al.
 system. This di†erence in the reddening-corrected
distance moduli results from a 0.02 mag mean o†set in the
V -band, and a 0.04 mag mean o†set in the I-band. The
more recent calibrations are based on a more extensive calibration data set than that available in the Hill et al. or the
Saha et al. analyses, and they result in galaxy distance
moduli that are closer. The main reason for this di†erence is
that the earlier Hill et al. ““ long ÏÏ versus ““ short ÏÏ zero points
determined for globular clusters (bright stars on faint sky)
turned out to be inappropriate for the Cepheid Ðelds (faint
stars on bright sky) because the combinations of Ñux dependence and background dependence were di†erent in the two
situations. P. B. Stetson 
indicates that a 0.02È0.03 mag uncertainty remains due to
this e†ect. The Stetson CTE correction is in agreement with
Dolphin and Whitmore et al. : the Stetson zero
point results in reddening-corrected distance moduli that
agree to within 1.5% (0.03 mag) of the new calibration by
Dolphin . Although Stetson did not Ðnd a signiÐcant
time dependence (as seen in the more recent studies), in all

Unfortunately, until
linear, well-calibrated detectors can be applied to the Key
Project reference stars, this uncertainty is unlikely to be
eliminated.
3. THE CEPHEID DISTANCE SCALE
The Cepheid period-luminosity relation remains the most
important of the primary distance indicators for nearby
galaxies. The strengths and weaknesses of Cepheids have
been reviewed extensively . However, since the Cepheid
distance scale lies at the heart of the
Key Project, we
summarize both its advantages and disadvantages brieÑy
here again.
The strengths of Cepheids are, of course, many: they are
among the brightest stellar indicators, and they are relatively young stars, found in abundance in spiral galaxies.
Thus, many independent objects can be observed in a single
galaxy. Their large amplitudes and characteristic (sawtooth)
light curve shapes facilitate their discovery and identiÐcation; they also have long lifetimes, and hence can be reobserved at other times and other wavelengths (unlike
supernovae, for example). The Cepheid period-luminosity
relation has a small scatter .
Moreover, Cepheids have been studied and theoretically
modeled extensively; the reason for their variability is well
understood to be a consequence of pulsation of the atmosphere, resulting from a thermodynamic, valvelike driving
mechanism as (primarily) helium is cycled from a singly
to doubly ionized state, and the opacity increases with
compression.
There are also difficulties associated with measuring
Cepheid distances. First, since Cepheids are young stars,
they are found in regions where there is dust scattering,
absorption, and reddening. Corrections must be made for
extinction, requiring assumptions about the universal
behavior of Cepheids at di†erent wavelengths, and about
the universality of the Galactic extinction law. Extinction is
systematic, and its e†ects must either be removed by multicolor data or minimized by observing at long wavelengths,
or both. Second, the dependence of the PL relation on
chemical composition (metallicity) has been very difficult to
quantify. Third, an accurate geometric calibration of the PL
relation, at any given metallicity, has not yet been established. Fourth, as the distance of the galaxy increases (and
the resolution decreases), Ðnding and measuring individual
Cepheids becomes increasingly difficult because of crowding e†ects. Finally, the reach of Cepheids is currently (with
HST ) conÐned to spiral galaxies with distances less than
about 30 Mpc. Hence, Cepheids alone cannot be observed
at sufficient distances to determine
directly, and an accu-
rate determination of
requires an extension to other
3.1. Adopted Method for Measuring Cepheid Distances
The application of the PL relation for the Key Project
follows the procedure developed in Freedman and
extended in Freedman, Wilson, & Madore . The
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) PL relation has been used
as Ðducial, and a distance modulus of
k0 \ 18.50
distance of 50 kpc) and a mean reddening of E(V [I) \ 0.13
[E(B[V ) \ 0.10] mag have
been adopted. The LMC V - and I-band PL relations are
Ðtted by least-squares to the target spiral data to determine
apparent distance moduli in each band. A reddeningcorrected distance modulus and di†erential absorption with
respect to the LMC are obtained using a ratio of total-toselective absorption
(e.g., Card-
R \ AV/(AV [ AI) \ 2.45
elli, Mathis, & Clayton 1989). This procedure is equivalent
to deÐning a reddening-free index W \ V [ R(V [ I)
 .
3.2. E†ect of Metallicity on the Cepheid
Period-L uminosity Relation
A long-standing uncertainty in the Cepheid distance scale
has been the possibility that the zero point of the PL relation is sensitive to chemical composition . It is only within the
last decade or so that major observational e†orts to address
the metallicity issue for Cepheids have been undertaken.
Accurately establishing the size of a metallicity e†ect for
Cepheids alone has proven to be very challenging, and the
issue has not yet been deÐnitively resolved. However,
although neither the magnitude of the e†ect nor its wavelength dependence have yet been Ðrmly established, the
observational and theoretical evidence for an e†ect is steadily growing. Published empirical values for the index c (see
eq. in ° 3.3 below) range from 0 to [1.3 mag dex~1
(with most values between 0 and [0.4), but these published
values have been derived using a variety of di†erent combinations of bandpasses. Since the e†ects of metallicity are
wavelength dependent, it is critical that the appropriate correction for a given data set be applied.
Some recent theoretical models suggest that at the V I
bandpasses of the Key Project, the e†ect of metallicity is
mag dex~1. Unfortunately, the sign of the
cVI D [0.1
e†ect is still uncertain. For example, Caputo et al. 
Ðnd a slope of 0.27 mag dex~1, with the opposite sign. Thus,
for the present, calibrating the metallicity e†ect based on
models alone is not feasible.
A di†erential, empirical test for the e†ects of metallicity
on the Cepheid distance scale was Ðrst carried out by Freedman & Madore for the nearby galaxy M31. As part
of the Key Project, we carried out a second di†erential test
 . These two studies are consistent
with there being a shallow metallicity dependence, but the
statistical signiÐcance of each test is individually low. As a
follow-up to the optical study, H-band NICMOS observations have been obtained for the two Ðelds previously
observed in the optical in M101 . A comparison of the V IH photometry for the inner and outer
Ðelds is consistent with a metallicity sensitivity of the PL

relations, but artiÐcial star tests in the inner Ðeld indicate
that crowding is signiÐcant, and precludes an accurate
determination of the magnitude of the e†ect. Other recent
studies conclude
that a metallicity e†ect is extant, and all of the empirical
studies agree on the sign, if not the magnitude of the e†ect.
Considering all of the evidence currently available and the
(still considerable) uncertainties, we therefore adopt cVI \
[0.2 ^ 0.2 mag dex~1, approximately the midrange of
current empirical values, and correct our Cepheid distances
accordingly.
3.3. Adopted Period-L uminosity Relations
For earlier papers in this series, we adopted the slopes
and zero points for the LMC V and I PL relations from
Madore & Freedman , based on 32 Cepheids. These
PL relations are consistent with those published by Feast &
Walker . However, the OGLE survey has recently
produced a signiÐcantly larger sample of D650 LMC Cepheids . This sample has extensive phase
coverage at BV I magnitudes and covers the period range of
0.4 \ log P \ 1.5. As part of the Key Project, we also
undertook observations of a sample of 105 LMC Cepheids
(K. Sebo et al., in preparation), and these PL relations are in
very good statistical agreement with those of Udalski et al.,
adjusting to a common distance to the LMC. For about 60
objects common to both samples, with P [ 8 days and
magnitudes,
[0.004 ^ 0.008 mag in I and ]0.013 ^ 0.010 mag in V
(Sebo et al.). The Sebo et al. sample extends to longer
periods (D40 days), and has 10 Cepheids with periods
greater than 30 days, the limit of the Udalski et al. sample.
These 10 Cepheids are all well Ðtted by, and lie within 1 p of,
the period-luminosity slopes deÐned by the Udalski et al.
sample. The Udalski et al. data are clearly the most extensive to date, and we thus adopt their apparent PL relations
as Ðducial for the reanalysis in this paper.
The Udalski et al. PL calibration adopts a distance
modulus of 18.2 mag, based on a distance determined using
the red clump technique, whereas, as discussed above, in
this paper we adopt a true distance modulus to the LMC of
18.50 mag. With this modulus and the reddening-corrected
Udalski et al. Cepheid data to deÐne the slopes and errors,
our adopted
PL relations become
MV \ [2.760[^0.03](log P [ 1) [ 4.218[^0.02]
(pV \ ^0.16) ,
MI \ [2.962[^0.02](log P [ 1) [ 4.904[^0.01]
(pI \ ^0.11) .
In the absence of a metallicity dependence, and correcting
only for reddening, the true distance moduli
calculated from the apparent V and I distance moduli (kV
as follows:
k0 \ kW \ kV [ R(kV [ kI) \ 2.45kI [ 1.45kV
\ W ]3.255[^0.01](log P[1) ] 5.899[^0.01]
(pW \ ^0.08) .
As discussed in more detail in ° 3.4, it is the change in
slope of the I-band PL relation that has the most impact on
the resulting distances.
Allowing for a correction term
for a metallicity
dependence of the Cepheid PL relation in terms of the
observed H II region abundance of oxygen relative to
hydrogen (see ° 8.3), the true distance modulus becomes
k0 \ kV [ R(kV [ kI) ] dkZ ,
is applied to the
dkZ \ cVI([O/H] [ [O/H]LMC)
reddening-corrected (V I) modulus, and
is measured in

metallicity).
3.4. New Revised Cepheid Distances
Over the six years that we have been publishing data
from the Key Project, our analysis methods, as well as the
photometric calibration, have evolved and improved.
Hence, the sample of published Key Project distances has
not been analyzed completely homogeneously. In this
paper, we have redetermined the true moduli to each galaxy
used in the Key Project. These distances are calculated with
the new calibration described above, and with attention to
minimizing bias at the short-period end of the PL relation,
as described below and by Freedman et al. , Kelson
et al. , and Ferrarese et al. .
In this analysis we have (1) consistently adopted only the
published Cepheid photometry, which were reduced using
the ALLFRAME stellar photometry reduction package,
whose phase points were converted to mean magnitudes
using intensity-weighted averages (or their template-Ðtted
equivalents).20 (2) To compensate for the small (D0.01 mag)
mean bias in the PL Ðts (see the discussion in ° 8.4 and
Appendix A), we have also applied period cuts to the PL
relations, thereby eliminating the shortest period Cepheids,
where magnitude incompleteness e†ects become important.
In two cases (NGC 3368 and NGC 300), a single longperiod Cepheid was also dropped because of stochastic
e†ects at the bright (sparsely populated) end of the PL relation, which can similarly bias solutions. The mean correction for this magnitude-limited bias is small (]1% in
distance), but it is systematic, and correcting for it results in
larger distances than are determined without this faint-end
debiasing. (3) We have adopted a [0.07 mag correction to
the Hill et al. WFPC2 calibration to be consistent
with Stetson and Dolphin . Finally, (4) we have
adopted the published slopes of the Udalski et al. PL
relations.
The adoption of the new Udalski et al. PL slopes
alone has a dramatic and unanticipated e†ect on the previously published Cepheid distances based on the Madore
& Freedman calibration. Most importantly, the
change is distance dependent. The V and I PL slopes for the
Madore & Freedman calibration, based on 32 stars, are
[2.76 ^ 0.11 and [3.06 ^ 0.07, respectively. The new
Udalski et al. values for these same quantities are
[2.76 ^ 0.03
[2.96 ^ 0.02
Although the V -band slopes agree identically, and the
I-band slopes di†er by only 0.1, the impact on the derived
reddenings, and therefore distances, is signiÐcant. The new
calibration
reddenings,
smaller distances. In addition, because of the di†erence in
20 For Key Project galaxies, both phase-weighted and intensityweighted magnitudes were generally calculated for each of the galaxies,
and found to be in very good agreement. This is to be expected, since the
optimal scheduling results in well-sampled phase coverage.

reddenings for Cepheids of increasing period. As a result,
the di†erences in distance between the previous and the new
calibration will be largest for galaxies at greater distances,
where the mean period of the samples is larger (since a
greater fraction of shorter period Cepheids will fall below
the detection threshold in the most distant targets).

in distance. At 30 days, this di†erence is 6%, and it rises to
9.5% (or [0.19 mag in distance modulus) at 60 days.

(such as NGC 6822 or WLM) that are not calibrators for
the secondary methods adopted in this paper. The Ðts were
done using the same standard procedure described in ° 3.1,
and adopting equation (3). To make it clear where the di†erences lie compared to previous calibrations, we list in
columns (1)È(4) of Table 3 the galaxies, distance moduli,
errors, and number of Cepheids Ðtted, based on the Madore
& Freedman LMC PL relations, and ALLFRAME
magnitudes, for an LMC distance modulus of 18.50 mag. In
columns (5) and (6), we list distance moduli and errors for
Ðts to the same Cepheid samples adopting the Udalski et al.
 PL slopes. In columns (7), (8), and (9), distance
moduli, errors, and the number of Cepheids Ðtted are given,
after imposing period cuts correcting for PL bias as
described above. Finally, references for the sources for the
Cepheid photometry are given in column (10). In Table 4,
we list the galaxy name, apparent V and I distance moduli,
PL-Ðtting (random) errors, E(V [I), and distance moduli
on the new calibration for the case where no metallicity
correction has been applied
and where a correc-
mag dex~1 is adopted. In addition, we

list the distance in Mpc and the metallicities for the Cepheid
Ðelds. For ease of comparison, column (7) of Table 3 and
column (8) of Table 4 are the same distance moduli values,
uncorrected for metallicity.
The errors on the Cepheid distances are calculated as
follows. The random uncertainties,
are given by
pW2 /(N [ 1) ,
where N is the number of Cepheids observed in a given
galaxy. The error in W ,
includes the random errors in

are given by

with corresponding terms due to the uncertainty in the
LMC zero point, metallicity, photometric zero point, and
aperture corrections. A further discussion of errors can be

Velocities in this plot have been corrected using the Ñow model described
in Mould et al. . The Cepheid distances have been corrected for

with the value of
obtained for methods that extend to much greater
distances.
another apparent divergence in the Cepheid distance scale
is also ameliorated by this new calibration; that of the difference between the maser and the Cepheid distance to
NGC 4258. As discussed further in ° 8.1.1, adopting the Key
Project Ðtting methodology, ALLFRAME photometry,
template-Ðtted magnitudes, and the new calibration, the
Cepheid distance to NGC 4258 comes into better agreement with the maser distance to this galaxy . Finally, the reddening solutions for two galaxies,
NGC 300 and IC 4182, previously yielded negative values.
The adoption of the new Udalski et al. slopes results
in positive reddening solutions for both of these (and now
all) galaxies with measured Cepheid distances.
4. THE LOCAL FLOW FIELD
Before proceeding with a determination of the Hubble
constant, we turn our attention to the question of the local
Ñow Ðeld, recalling that
requires a solid knowledge of
both distances and velocities. The large-scale distribution of
matter in the nearby universe perturbs the local Hubble
Ñow, causing peculiar motions. If uncorrected for, these perturbations can be a signiÐcant fraction of the measured
radial velocity, particularly for the nearest galaxies. The
local Ñow Ðeld has been modeled extensively by a number
of authors . In general, there is good
qualitative agreement among di†erent studies. On average,
these peculiar motions amount to D200È300 km s~1
 , but the Ñow Ðeld
is complicated locally by the presence of massive, nearby
structures, most notably the Virgo Cluster. At 3000 km s~1,
the peculiar motion for an individual object can amount to
a 7%È10% perturbation, whereas for Type Ia supernovae
(which reach out to 30,000 km s~1), these e†ects drop to less
than 1%, on average.
For the nearest galaxies, the e†ects of the local peculiar
velocity Ðeld and the resulting uncertainty in
quite large. For example, a recent study by Willick & Batra
 Ðnds values of
and 92 ^ 5 km s~1
H0 \ 85 ^ 5
Mpc~1 based on applying di†erent local velocity models to
27 Cepheid galaxies within D20 Mpc. However, the velocity model of Han & Mould applied to 12 Cepheid
distances Ðts best with
km s~1 Mpc~1 . Some of this di†erence reÑects a di†erence in calibration of the surface brightness Ñuctuation method.
However, the remaining large discrepancies serve to emphasize that the Key Project strategy of extending secondary
distance measurements beyond 100 Mpc, where recession

velocities have become large, is preferable to any local
determination.
For the Key Project, we have corrected the observed
galaxy velocities for the local Ñow Ðeld as described in
Mould et al. .21 A linear infall model composed of three mass concentrations (the Local Supercluster,
the Great Attractor, and the Shapley concentration) is constructed with parameters estimated from existing catalogs
of Tully-Fisher distances and velocities. In ° 8.6, we return
to the question of whether there is evidence for a bulk (or
nonconverging) Ñow on larger scales.
5. CEPHEID HUBBLE DIAGRAM
A Hubble diagram for 23 galaxies with Cepheid distances
is shown in Figure 1. The galaxy velocities have been corrected for the Ñow-Ðeld model described above. The error
bars in this plot reÑect the di†erence between the predictions from this Ñow Ðeld and those of Tonry et al. . A
Ðt to the data yields a slope of 75 ^ 10 km s~1 Mpc~1,
excluding systematic errors. As we show in ° 7, the scatter is
larger in this Hubble diagram than for the secondary
methods that operate at greater distances; however, the
mean value of
for nearby galaxies is in very good agree-
ment with the distant sample. In Table 5, we give the uncorrected, heliocentric velocities for the Cepheid galaxies, and
the velocities as successive corrections are added: corrections for the Local Group, the Virgo cluster, the Great
Attractor, and the Shapley concentration. The velocities
plotted include all of these corrections. For comparison, we
also list the velocities calculated from the Tonry et al. 
Ñow model, using our Cepheid distances, and assuming
km s~1 Mpc~1 and
as in their paper.
There are some di†erences between the simple Ñow model
that we have adopted and the Tonry et al. model, most
signiÐcantly the Fornax Cluster galaxies. Our adopted
triple-attractor model yields a quieter Ñow at Fornax, and
reproduces the cosmic microwave background frame. The
agreement for the Virgo Cluster, however, is excellent.
Again, this comparison demonstrates the importance of
at large distances where uncertainties in the
velocities become unimportant.
6. RELATIVE DISTANCE METHODS AND H0
For the determination of
a given method for measur-
ing distances should satisfy several basic criteria : (1) It should exhibit high internal precision; (2) it should have a solid empirical calibration; (3)
ideally, it should be applicable to large distances (and therefore not subject to signiÐcant systematics due to large-scale
Ñows); and also (4) ideally, it should be based on straightforward physics. As discussed further below, based on these
criteria, each of the relative distance indicators has its own
merits and drawbacks. For example, Type Ia supernovae
(SN Ia) have a number of advantages relative to other
methods: currently they can be applied at the greatest distances (D400 Mpc), and the internal precision of this
method is very high. However, Ðnding them is difficult:
supernovae are rare objects, and separating the supernova
from the background light of the galaxy is challenging in the
inner regions of galaxies. Moreover, for nearby galaxies,
21 Note that the signs in equation (A2) published in Mould et al. 2000a
are wrong in the text; however, they were correct in the code used to do the
calculations.
surveying for supernovae is a time-consuming process that
must be done on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. The internal
precision of the surface brightness Ñuctuation (SBF) method
is also very high, but this method currently has the most
limited distance range, only D70 Mpc. Of somewhat lower
internal precision is the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation, but it
can be applied out to intermediate distances (D150 Mpc).
The fundamental plane (FP) for elliptical galaxies can be
applied, in principle, out to z D 1, but in practice, stellar
evolution e†ects limit this method to
(D400 Mpc).
Moreover, since elliptical galaxies do not contain Cepheids,
the FP calibration currently relies on less direct group/
cluster distances. Each of these distance indicators is now
discussed brieÑy. The results from these methods are then
combined in ° 7.
6.1. Type Ia Supernovae
One of the most promising cosmological distance indicators is the peak brightness of Type Ia supernovae. Of longstanding interest , this secondary indicator currently probes farther into
the unperturbed Hubble Ñow, and possesses the smallest
intrinsic scatter of any of the indicators discussed thus far. A
simple lack of Cepheid calibrators prevented the accurate
calibration of Type Ia supernovae prior to HST . Substantial improvements to the supernova distance scale have
resulted from recent dedicated, ground-based supernova
search and follow-up programs yielding CCD light curves
 , as
well as a campaign to Ðnd Cepheids in nearby galaxies that
have been host to Type Ia supernovae .
An ALLFRAME analysis of the Cepheid distances to
Type Ia supernova hosts and a comparison with the
published DoPHOT results was undertaken by Gibson et
al. as part of the Key Project. Using the same pipeline reduction methods that we applied to all of the Key
Project galaxies, we independently derived Cepheid distances to seven galaxies that were hosts to Type Ia supernovae. We found that on average, our new distance moduli
were 0.12 ^ 0.07 mag (6% in distance) smaller than those
previously published (see Gibson et al., Table 4). Adopting
the recalibrated distances, and applying these to the
reddening-corrected Hubble relations of Suntze† et al.
 , Gibson et al. determined a value of H0 \ 68 ^ 2
(random) ^ 5 (systematic) km s~1 Mpc~1. In general, the
published DoPHOT Cepheid photometry and our ALL-
FRAME analysis agree quite well, at or signiÐcantly better
than the 1 p level, with the I-band data tending to show
poorer agreement. Thus, photometric reduction is not the
major source of the di†erence. A variety of reasons, detailed
by Gibson et al., lead to the di†erences in the Ðnal distance
In principle, one could average the distances determined
by the two groups. However, in some cases, there are very
clear-cut reasons to prefer the Gibson et al. results. For
example, in the case of NGC 4536, the WFC2 chip results
are discrepant (by 0.66 mag) in the Saha et al. 
DoPHOT analysis, whereas the Saha et al. analysis of the
other three chips agrees with our ALLFRAME analysis of
all four WFPC chips. Parodi et al. have attributed
this di†erence to uncertainties in aperture corrections, and
continue to prefer to average all four chips together.
However, given their quoted aperture-correction uncer-

tainties (0.10È0.15 mag), and the fact that our analysis
reveals no such di†erence in aperture correction, this
appears to be an unlikely explanation. For the case of NGC
4639, Saha et al. introduced a di†erent weighting
scheme for that galaxy only; however, in our analysis we
Ðnd no signiÐcant di†erence in a weighted or unweighted
Ðt. Our preferred approach is to treat the Ðtting of all the
galaxies and their reddening determinations in a consistent
manner, rather than adopting di†erent schemes for individual galaxies.
The supernova Hubble relation calibrated by Gibson et
al. was that of Suntze† et al. , based upon a
subsample of 35 supernovae from Hamuy et al. and

these additional 22 supernovae to the original Hamuy et al.

since its redshift is in excess of the regime over which the

correction for the internal reddening of the host galaxy,
from Phillips et al. , has been applied. In
E(B[V )Host,
the third panel of Figure 2, our adopted subset of 36 supernovae have had their peak magnitudes corrected for their
light curve shape, via application of a simple linear Ðt to the
relation between decline rate,
and peak magni-
tude. This correction echoes that adopted in the original
Hamuy et al. analysis, as opposed to the quadratic
Ðts adopted by Phillips et al. and Gibson et al.
 ; however, we Ðnd no di†erence in the result whether
a linear or quadratic Ðt is adopted.
Adopting our default Hubble relations (Fig. 2) coupled
with the zero points provided by our revised Cepheid distances (applying a metallicity correction of [0.2 ^ 0.2 mag
dex~1) to NGC 4639, 4536, 3627, 3368, 5253, and IC 4182
from Table 4 yields a value of
H0 \ 71 ^ 2 ^ 6
Mpc~1. This value can be compared to that from Gibson et
al. of
km s~1 Mpc~1. The di†er-
H0 \ 68 ^ 2 ^ 5
compared to Gibson et al. comes from the new
calibration of the PL relation, a metallicity correction, and
our adoption of an expanded supernovae sample. An error
analysis identical to that employed by Gibson et al. was
assumed here. The velocities, distances,
values, and
uncertainties for the 36 Type Ia supernovae used in this
analysis are listed in Table 6.
6.2. T he Tully-Fisher Relation
For spiral galaxies, the total (corrected to face-on
inclination) luminosity is strongly correlated with the
maximum rotation velocity of the galaxy (corrected to
edge-on inclination), which is useful for measuring extragalactic distances . The
Tully-Fisher relation at present is the most commonly
applied distance indicator: thousands of distances are now
available for galaxies both in the general Ðeld and in groups
and clusters. The scatter in this relation is approximately

^0.3 mag , or ^15% in distance for a single galaxy. In a
broad sense, the Tully-Fisher relation can be understood in
terms of the virial relation applied to rotationally supported
disk galaxies, under the assumption of a constant mass-tolight ratio . However, a
detailed self-consistent physical picture that reproduces the
Tully-Fisher relation , and
the role of dark matter in producing almost universal spiral
galaxy rotation curves still remain a
challenge.
Macri et al. obtained new BV RI photometry, and
using published data remeasured line widths for the
Cepheid galaxies that are Tully-Fisher calibrators. Sakai et
al. applied this calibration to a sample of 21 clusters
out to 9000 km s~1 observed by Giovanelli et al. , and
to an H-band sample of 10 clusters from Aaronson et al.
 . With an adopted distance to the LMC of 50
kpc, Sakai et al. determined a value of
H0 \ 71 ^ 4 ^ 7
s~1 Mpc~1. Based on the same set of Key Project Cepheid
calibrator distances, the same LMC zero point, and a compilation of BRIK data for Tully-Fisher cluster galaxies from
the literature, Tully & Pierce determined a value of
km s~1 Mpc~1 (at a quoted 95% conÐdence
H0 \ 77 ^ 8
level). In the I band, where there is good overlap with Tully
and Pierce, Sakai et al. found
H0 \ 73 ^ 2 ^ 9
Mpc~1. Based on analyses using an earlier available subset
of Cepheid calibrators, Giovanelli et al. concluded
km s~1 Mpc~1, consistent with Madore
H0 \ 69 ^ 5
et al. , who obtained
H0 \ 72 ^ 5 ^ 7
Mpc~1. However, for a consistent set of calibrators, the
di†erence in these values probably reÑects some of the systematic uncertainties inherent in implementing the Tully-
Fisher technique. Tully & Pierce discuss at length possible
reasons for the source of the di†erences among various
published values of
based on the Tully-Fisher relation,
but they conclude that the reason for much of this discrepancy remains unresolved.
Adopting the same Tully-Fisher (BV IH) galaxy sample
discussed in Sakai et al. , applying the new PL calibration, and adopting the metallicity-corrected distances
for the Tully-Fisher calibrators given in Table 4 results in a
km s~1 Mpc~1, with no net

change from that published by Sakai et al. The adopted
distances and velocities for the Tully-Fisher clusters used in
this analysis are given in Table 7. Also tabulated are the
velocities in the cosmic microwave background frame, and
values and uncertainties.
6.3. Fundamental Plane for Elliptical Galaxies
For elliptical galaxies, a correlation exists between the
stellar velocity dispersion and the intrinsic luminosity
 , analogous to the relation between
rotation velocity and luminosity for spirals. Elliptical galaxies are found to occupy a ““ fundamental plane ÏÏ (re P
in which a deÐned galaxy e†ective radius

and central velocity dispersion of the galaxy (p) ; and a D 1.2 and

based on Key Project distances to spiral galaxies in the Leo
I group, and the Virgo and Fornax Clusters, yielding H0 \
78 ^ 5 ^ 9 km s~1 Mpc~1. The revised Cepheid distances
presented in this paper result in new distances to the Virgo
Cluster, the Fornax Cluster, and the Leo I group (Table 8).
The galaxies in these objects are among the most distant in
the Key Project sample, and they also have high metallicities. Hence, the new calibration impacts the fundamental
plane more than the other secondary methods analyzed
here. The new calibration yields
H0 \ 82 ^ 6 ^ 9
Mpc~1, adopting a metallicity correction of [0.2 ^ 0.2
mag dex~1. The number of galaxies, adopted distances,
velocities,
values, and uncertainties for the clusters in
this analysis are given in Table 9.
6.4. Surface Brightness Fluctuations
Another method with high internal precision, developed
by Tonry & Schneider and Tonry et al. ,
makes use of the fact that the resolution of stars within
galaxies is distance dependent. This method is applicable to
elliptical galaxies or to spirals with prominent bulges. By
normalizing to the mean total Ñux and correcting for an
observed color dependence, relative distances to galaxies
can be measured. The intrinsic scatter of this method is
small: a factor of 3 improvement compared to the Tully-
Fisher and
relations makes the method an order of
magnitude less susceptible to Malmquist biases. Application of the method requires careful removal of sources of
noise, such as bad pixels on the detector or objects such as
star clusters, dust lanes, background galaxies, and foreground stars. With HST , this method is now being
extended to larger distances ; unfortunately, however, only six galaxies beyond the Fornax
Cluster have published surface brightness Ñuctuation distances, with only four of them accurate enough to be of
interest for cosmology. Furthermore, all lie within the very
narrow range cz \ 3800È5800 km s~1, where local Ñow-
Ðeld contributions to the observed velocities are still nonnegligible (D15% vCMB).
As part of the Key Project, Ferrarese et al. 
applied an HST Cepheid calibration to the four Lauer et al.
 SBF galaxies, and derived
H0 \ 69 ^ 4 ^ 6
Mpc~1. The results are unchanged if all six clusters are
included. The largest sources of random uncertainty are the
large-scale Ñow corrections to the velocities, combined with
the very sparse sample of available galaxies. Most of the
systematic uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in
the Cepheid calibration of the method itself . These three factors account for
the 10% di†erence between the SBF-based values of H0
derived by the KP and that of Tonry et al. . Flowcorrected velocities, distances, and
values for the six
clusters with SBF measurements are given in Table 10.
Applying our new calibration, we obtain H0 \ 70 ^ 5 ^ 6
km s~1 Mpc~1, applying a metallicity correction of [0.2
mag dex~1, as described in ° 3.
6.5. Type II Supernovae
Type II supernovae result from massive stars. They are
fainter, and show a wider variation in luminosity than the
Type Ia supernovae. Although not ““ standard candles,ÏÏ
Type II supernovae can yield distances through application
of the Baade-Wesselink technique to their expanding atmospheres. By following the time evolution of spectra for the

expanding atmosphere (yielding the radius as a function of
time and velocity), in combination with the photometric
angular size (yielding the ratio of the radius to the distance
of the supernova), the distance to the supernova can be
obtained. Recent applications of this technique have been
undertaken by Schmidt, Eastman, & Kirschner and
Eastman, Schmidt, & Kirschner using detailed model
atmospheres to correct for the scattering in the atmosphere.
In principle, the method can be applied independent of the
local calibration of the extragalactic distance scale. The
diversity of di†erent methods is critical in constraining the
overall systematic errors in the distances measured as part
of the Key Project, since the underlying physics of expanding supernova atmospheres is completely independent of
the Cepheid distance scale and its calibration. Based on 16
Type II supernovae, covering a range of redshifts from
cz \ 1100 to 14,600 km s~1, Schmidt et al. determine
a value of
km s~1 Mpc~1.
H0 \ 73 ^ 6 ^ 7
In Table 11, we list the three galaxies currently having
both Cepheid and Type II supernovae (SN II) distances.
The Type II supernovae distances are from Schmidt et al.
 . The distances from the two methods agree well
within the quoted errors, and a weighted Ðt for the three
calibrators yields a mean di†erence in the distance moduli
of 0.09 ^ 0.14 mag, in the sense of the Cepheids giving
slightly shorter distances. A fourth galaxy, NGC 3627, also
has both a Cepheid and a Type II distance, but the latter
has a quoted uncertainty of ^1.00 mag. We did not include
the observed SNe II for M81, M100, or NGC 1559 because
Schmidt, Kirshner, & Eastman comment that these supernovae are peculiar SNe II. There are four galaxies in the

are corrected for metallicity, since two of the calibrators (the
LMC and M101) are not a†ected by the metallicity term,
and the di†erence in distance modulus for NGC 7331 is
only 0.03 mag. Hence, the value of

HST KEY PROJECT SUMMARY
We note that our results agree very well with Schmidt et
al. , despite the 5% di†erence in the distances seen in
Table 11. However, we have limited our
analysis to
galaxies beyond cz \ 1500 km s~1, whereas 10 of the 14
galaxies in the Schmidt et al. sample are within this limit.
The nearest supernovae (where Ñow Ðeld e†ects are largest)
yield a higher value of H0.
7. COMBINING THE RESULTS AND A VALUE FOR H0
In Table 12, we list the values of
obtained for each of
the secondary methods that are based on our Cepheid distances, updated using the new calibration described in ° 3.4.
For each method, the formal random and systematic uncertainties are given. We defer until ° 8 a detailed discussion of
the systematic uncertainties that a†ect all of these methods
equally; however, the dominant overall systematic errors
include the uncertainty in the WFPC2 photometric calibration, and the uncertainty in the adopted distance to the
LMC, metallicity, and bulk motions of galaxies on large
(cz Z 10,000
We next address the question of how to combine the
obtained using the di†erent secondary
methods, given Ðve independent measurements,
All of these methods are based on a common
Cepheid zero point, although with di†erent subsets of
Cepheid calibrators. We now treat the combination of these
values using the quoted internal errors. The secondary
methods themselves are largely independent of each other
(for example, the kinematics of spiral disks represented by
the Tully-Fisher relation are independent of the physics of
the explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs that give rise
to Type Ia supernovae, and in turn are independent of the
physics relating to the luminosity Ñuctuations of red giant
stars used by SBF). We use three methods to combine the
results: a classical (frequentist) analysis, a Bayesian analysis,
and a weighting scheme based on numerical simulations.
Because of the relatively small range of the individual determinations
km s~1 Mpc~1, with most of the
(H0 \ 70È82
values clustered toward the low end of this range), all three
methods for combining the
values are in very good
agreement. This result alone gives us conÐdence that the
combined value is a robust one, and that the choice of
statistical method does not determine the result, nor does it
strongly depend on the choice of assumptions and priors.
In the Bayesian data analysis, a conditional probability
distribution is calculated, based on a model or prior. With a
Bayesian formalism, it is necessary to be concerned about
the potential subjectivity of adopted priors and whether
they inÑuence the Ðnal result. However, one of the advantages of Bayesian techniques is that the assumptions about
the distribution of probabilities are stated up front, whereas,
in fact, all statistical methods have underlying but often less
explicit assumptions, even the commonly applied frequentist approaches (including a simple weighted average, for
example). A strong advantage of the Bayesian method is
that it does not assume Gaussian distributions. Although
more common, frequentist methods are perhaps not always
the appropriate statistics to apply. However, the distinction
is often one of nomenclature rather than subjectivity
 .
In Figure 3, we plot probability distributions for the individual
determinations (see Table 12), each represented
by a Gaussian of unit area, with a dispersion given by their
individual p values. The cumulative distribution is shown
by the solid thick line. The median value is H0 \ 72 ^ 3

uncertainty. The systematic uncertainties for each method are indicated by

the ^34% points of the cumulative distribution. The systematic uncertainty is discussed below. For our Bayesian
analysis, we assume that the priors on
and on the prob-
ability of any single measurement being correct are uniform
and compute the project of the probability distributions. In
this case, we Ðnd

H0 \ 72 ^ 2 ^ 7
formal uncertainty on this result is very small, and simply
reÑects the fact that four of the values are clustered very
closely, while the uncertainties in the FP method are large.
Adjusting for the di†erences in calibration, these results are
also in excellent agreement with the weighting based on
numerical simulations of the errors by Mould et al. ,
which yielded 71 ^ 6 km s~1 Mpc~1, similar to an earlier
frequentist and Bayesian analysis of Key Project data
 giving
H0 \ 72 ^ 5 ^ 7
Mpc~1, based on a smaller subset of available Cepheid
calibrators.
As is evident from Figure 3, the value of
based on the
fundamental plane is an outlier. However, both the random
and systematic errors for this method are larger than for the
other methods, and hence the contribution to the combined
is relatively low, whether the results are
weighted by the random or systematic errors. We recall also
from Table 1 and ° 6 that the calibration of the fundamental
plane currently rests on the distances to only three clusters.
If we weight the fundamental-plane results factoring in the
small number of calibrators and the observed variance of
this method, then the fundamental plane has a weight that
ranges from 5 to 8 times smaller than any of the other four
methods, and results in a combined, metallicity-corrected
of 71 ^ 4 (random) km s~1 Mpc~1.

8. OVERALL SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES
There are a number of systematic uncertainties that a†ect
the determination of
for all the relative distance indica-
tors discussed in the previous sections. These errors di†er
from the statistical and systematic errors associated with
each of the individual secondary methods, and they cannot
be reduced by simply combining the results from di†erent
methods. SigniÐcant sources of overall systematic error
include the uncertainty in the zero point of the Cepheid PL
relation, the e†ect of reddening and metallicity on the
observed PL relations, the e†ects of incompleteness bias
and crowding on the Cepheid distances, and velocity perturbations about the Hubble Ñow on scales comparable to,
or larger than, the volumes being sampled. Since the overall
accuracy in the determination of
is constrained by these
factors, we discuss each one of these e†ects in turn below.
For readers who may wish to skip the details of this part of
the discussion, we refer them directly to ° 8.7 for a summary.
8.1. Zero Point of the PL Relation
It has become standard for extragalactic Cepheid distance determinations to use the slopes of the LMC periodluminosity relations as Ðducial, with the zero point of the
Cepheid period-luminosity relation tied to the LMC at an
adopted distance modulus of 18.50 mag . However, over the past decade, even with more accurate and sensitive detectors, with many new methods for
measuring distances, and with many individuals involved in
this e†ort, the full range of the most of distance moduli to
the LMC remains at approximately 18.1È18.7 mag , corresponding to a range of 42È55 kpc.
For the purposes of the present discussion, we can
compare our adopted LMC zero point with other published
values. We show in Figure 5 published LMC distance
moduli expressed as probability density distributions, primarily for the period 1998È1999, as compiled by Gibson
 . Only the single most recent revision from a given
author and method is plotted. Each determination is represented by a Gaussian of unit area, with dispersions given
by the published errors. To facilitate viewing the individual
distributions (Fig. 5, light dotted lines), these have been
scaled up by a factor of 3. The thicker solid line shows the
cumulative distribution.
It is clear from the wide range of moduli compared to the
quoted internal errors in Figure 5 that systematic errors
a†ecting individual methods are still dominating the determinations of LMC distances. Some of the values at either
end of the distribution have error bars that do not overlap

moduli as compiled by Gibson plotted as a continuous probability

internal random error.
(at several p) with other methods. At present, there is no
single method with demonstrably lower systematic errors,
and we Ðnd no strong reason to prefer one end of the distribution over the other. For example, while systematics in
the Cepheid period-luminosity relation have been subjected
to scrutiny for many decades, no accurate photometric zero
point has yet been established based on astrometric distances, and the zero point is still in debate . The absolute astrometric calibration is
statistically more reliable for the red clump method, but
compared to many other methods, this method is still relatively new, and the systematics have not been studied in as
much detail .
In addition to the cumulative probability distributions,
we have computed Bayesian probability distributions,
assuming a uniform prior. The Bayesian and median or
average frequentist methods yield excellent agreement at
18.45 and 18.47 mag, respectively. Another way of estimating the overall uncertainty is simply to estimate the overall
average and the standard error of the mean, based on a
mean distance for di†erent methods, and giving each technique unit weight. An advantage of this procedure is that it
simply averages over all the inherent systematic uncertainties that a†ect any given method. There are seven independent
commonly applied to the LMC; these include Cepheids, the
red clump, eclipsing binaries, SN 1987A light echoes, tip of
the red giant branch (TRGB), RR Lyrae stars, and Mira
variables. The mean values of the LMC distance moduli
and the standard error of the mean for each technique are
given in Table 13, for the Gibson and Westerlund
 compilations. For the Gibson compilation, these
averaged distance moduli range from 18.27 to 18.64 mag,
with an overall mean of 18.45 mag, and an rms dispersion of
^0.15 mag. The standard error of the mean therefore
amounts to ^0.06 mag. The mean based on the Westerlund
data is in excellent agreement at 18.46 ^ 0.05 mag.
From the above discussion, it can be seen that there still
remains a range in distance moduli to the LMC based on a
wide range of methods. However, our adopted Cepheid
modulus of 18.50 ^ 0.10 mag agrees with the mean and
median of the distribution for other methods at the 2.5%
level.22 Given the remaining uncertainties and the good
agreement with other methods, we do not believe that a
change in zero point is warranted at present. However, we
note that the uncertainty in the distance to the LMC is one
of the largest remaining uncertainties in the overall error
budget for the determination of
We note that if the
distance modulus to the LMC is 18.3 mag, there will be a
resulting 10% increase in the value of
to 79 km s~1
It would be extremely useful to have a calibration that is
independent of the distance to the LMC. Very recently, a
new distance has been independently measured to the maser
galaxy NGC 4258, a nearby spiral galaxy also useful for
calibrating the extragalactic distance scale, which can
provide an external check on the adopted LMC zero-point
calibration. We brieÑy summarize the distance determination to NGC 4258 and its implications below.
8.1.1. NGC 4258: Comparison of a Maser and Cepheid Distance
Given the current uncertainties and systematics a†ecting
the local distance scale, it would be highly desirable to have
geometric methods for measuring distances, independent of
22 In two recent Key Project papers, we adopted a distance modulus
uncertainty to the LMC of ^0.13 mag . This value deÐned the 1 p dispersion based on a histogram of the
distance moduli compiled by Gibson . However, the standard error

the classical distance indicators. A very promising new geometric technique has recently been developed and applied
to the galaxy NGC 4258, a galaxy with an inner disk containing
masers . Five epochs of
measurements are now available for these masers, and both
radial and transverse motions of the maser system have
been measured. Assuming a circular Keplerian model for
the disk, Herrnstein et al. derive a distance to the galaxy of
7.2 ^ 0.3 Mpc, with the error increasing to ^0.5 Mpc
allowing for systematic uncertainties in the model.
To provide a comparison with the maser distance, Maoz
et al. used HST to discover a sample of 15 Cepheids
in NGC 4258. Adopting a distance modulus for the LMC of
18.50 mag, these authors determined a Cepheid distance to
NGC 4258 of 8.1 ^ 0.4 Mpc, or 12% farther than the maser
distance. These authors noted that the di†erence was not
highly signiÐcant, amounting to only 1.3 p. However, with
the new LMC PL relations given in equations (1) and (2)
and the correction to the WFPC2 zero point discussed in
° 2.5, the revised Cepheid distance is in somewhat better
agreement with the maser distance at 7.8 ^ 0.3 ^ 0.5 Mpc
 .23 This distance allows for a metallicity
correction
Unfortunately,
however, the situation remains that there is currently only
one maser galaxy with which to make this comparison. For
the future, increasing the sample of maser galaxies for which
distance measurements can be made (for example, with
ARISE, a proposed radio interferometer in space) would be
extremely valuable.
8.1.2. Resolving the Cepheid Zero-Point Discrepancy
Given the range of published LMC distance moduli (Fig.
5) and the subtle systematic errors that must be a†ecting
some (or all) of the distance methods, it appears unlikely
that this zero-point uncertainty will be resolved deÐnitively
any time soon. Upcoming interferometry (NASAÏs SIM and
ESAÏs GAIA) missions will deliver a few microarcsecond
astrometry, reaching fainter limits than Hipparcos (D20
mag); NASAÏs FAME will reach 50 mas accuracy. These
missions are capable of delivering 1% distances to many
Galactic Cepheids. They will be critical for establishing a
more accurate extragalactic distance scale zero point, and
should provide accurate parallaxes for statistically signiÐcant samples of many distance indicators currently in use
(e.g., Cepheids, RR Lyrae stars, red giant stars, red clump
stars). In addition, SIM may provide rotational parallaxes for some of the
nearest spiral galaxies, thereby allowing the calibration to
bypass the LMC altogether.
8.2. Reddening
As described in ° 3.1, the standard approach to correcting
Cepheid magnitudes for reddening by dust is to use a combination of bandpasses (V and I in the case of the
Project), and solve for the reddening using a Galactic
extinction law . For a value of the LMC
reddening appropriate to the Cepheid sample considered of
E(V [I) \ 0.13 mag, the reddenings in the HST Cepheid
target Ðelds range from E(V [I) \ 0.04 to 0.36 mag, with an
average of 0.19 mag (Table 4). As a check on possible sys-
23 The distances presented in the current paper are for ALLFRAME
magnitudes Tables 3 and 4; note that the new ALLFRAME distance to
NGC 4258 is 8.0 Mpc, in slightly worse disagreement with the maser
distance that that given in Newman et al. and quoted above.
tematic errors in the reddening determinations, recent
H-band (1.6 km) photometry has been obtained for a total
sample of 70 Cepheids in 12 galaxies, including IC 1613,
M31, M81, M101, NGC 925, NGC 1365, NGC 2090, NGC
3198, NGC 3621, NGC 4496A, NGC 4536, and IC 4182
 .
The Galactic reddening law of Cardelli et al. predicts
E(V [H) \ 1.98 ^ 0.16 E(V [I). For the galaxies with both
NICMOS H-band and optical V I data (from the ground or
HST ), the slope of the correlation between the optical and
near-infrared reddenings yields E(V [H) \ [2.00 ^ 0.22
E(V [I)] ] 0.02 ^ 0.04. This relation is based on the same
V I Udalski et al. data used in the current paper.
Hence, the IR data conÐrm the reddenings derived from the
optical data alone, ruling out a signiÐcant systematic error
in the reddening determinations.
8.3. Metallicity
As discussed in ° 3.2, recent empirical results suggest that
there is a small dependence of the Cepheid periodluminosity relation on metallicity. In this paper, we have
adopted a correction of [0.2 mag (10% in distance) for a
factor of 10 in abundance (O/H). The observed Ðelds in
Cepheid-calibrating galaxies have a range in (O/H) abundance of about a factor of 30 . These
abundances are those of H II regions in the Cepheid Ðelds,
calibrated on the scale of Zaritsky, Kennicutt, & Huchra
 . The mean abundance of this sample log (O/
H)] is 8.84 ^ 0.31 dex. This is higher than the LMC abundance of 8.50 dex . The mean o†set
between the metallicity-corrected and the uncorrected
Cepheid moduli in Table 4 amounts to 0.07 mag, or 3.5% in
distance. We adopt this di†erence as the uncertainty due to
metallicity. The e†ect is systematic, and with the exception
of Type II supernovae (° 6.5), if no correction for metallicity
is applied, the value of
is increased by D4% (D3 km s~1
Mpc~1). Conversely, if the slope of the metallicity relation is
[0.4 mag dex~1, then the value of
is decreased by 3 km
s~1 Mpc~1. We show in Figure 6 histograms of abundance
distributions for the Cepheid calibrators for the secondary
8.4. Completeness and Bias E†ects
An issue of recurring concern regarding the application of
distance indicators is the extent to which incompleteness in
the observed samples could lead to a bias in the derived
distances. This e†ect has been discussed extensively in the
literature, particularly in the context of the Tully-Fisher
relation . For Cepheids, the concern
derives from the fact that magnitude cuto†s in the Cepheid
samples (imposed by the decreasing signal-to-noise ratios at
faint magnitudes) will tend to select against the faintest variables, thereby leading to systematically small (biased)
moduli. The fact that the bias operates most strongly at the
shortest periods will also tend to produce a Ñattening of the
observed PL relation ; elimination
of the shortest period Cepheids from a sample will generally
result in increased mean moduli, less a†ected by this bias.
This e†ect is illustrated in Figure 10 in the Appendix,
along with an analytic derivation of the size of the bias. As
more distant objects are observed, a brighter intrinsic magnitude cuto† will occur for the same apparent magnitude.
The observed erroneous Ñattening of the PL slope extends

to longer and longer periods, including more and more of
the available Cepheid sample. Similar biases occur for any
standard candle possessing an intrinsic dispersion in luminosity: the larger the intrinsic dispersion of the relation
being truncated, and the shallower the range of apparent
magnitude being sampled, the larger the bias will be. For
the Key Project application of the Tully-Fisher relation
 , we adopted corrections for this incompleteness bias, based on simulations similar to those undertaken by Giovanelli et al. . For Type Ia supernovae,
the observed dispersion in the Hubble diagram amounts
to only D0.15 mag ; hence, incompleteness biases are very small for this
technique.
In the case of Cepheids, incompleteness biases are
expected to be small for the methodology that we have
adopted here. First, the intrinsic scatter is small, and
second, as discussed in ° 3.4, we have applied a period cuto†
above the limiting magnitude cuto† at the short-period end
to reduce the incompleteness bias . The scatter
in the observed V -band PL relation amounts to ^0.16 mag
(eq. ); the scatter in the I-band PL relation amounts to
^0.11 mag (eq. ); however, much of this scatter is physically correlated between bandpasses, so that the scatter in
the W PL relation is small. After correcting for reddening,
the correlated scatter in the combined relation for the true
distance modulus (or equivalently, W ; see ° 3.1) is smaller,
and amounts to only ^0.08 mag (eq. ). Hence, the
resulting bias on the Ðnal distance modulus is negligible for
most of the galaxies in the sample. As can be seen from the
di†erences between columns (5) and (7) in Table 3, typically
the size of the bias corrections amounts to only a few hundredths of a mag in the reddening-corrected (true) modulus;
in two cases (M81 and NGC 4414) they are as large as 0.08
and [0.08 mag (4% in distance), respectively, but the mean
correction for the sample is only ]0.01 mag.
8.5. Crowding and ArtiÐcial Star Tests
One of the most direct ways of assessing the quantitative
e†ects of chance superpositions on the photometry is by
adding artiÐcial stars with known input magnitudes and
colors into the actual HST images, and then recovering
those stars using exactly the same techniques used to
perform the original analysis . Their analysis indicates that the bias due to crowding in individual WFPC2
frames can be signiÐcant, ranging from 0.05 mag in a relatively uncrowded Ðeld of NGC 2541 (at 12 Mpc) to 0.2 mag
for a crowded Ðeld in one of the most distant galaxies, NGC
1365. We note that the artiÐcial stars in these frames were
not inserted with random positions. Each Ðeld was divided
up into a 10 ] 10 array of cells each 65 pixels on a side; the
probability that an artiÐcial star would be added within a
given cell was therefore proportional to the number of real
stars in the cell. The measured bias goes in the expected
sense of resulting in recovered magnitudes that are too
bright, and it is a direct function of the stellar density in the
Ðeld. However, when using the multiepoch V - and I-band
observations, and then imposing the same criteria on variable star selection as for the actual Cepheid sample (e.g.,
same error Ñags for deviant data points, same magnitude
range applicable to the period range for the known Cepheids, the same procedure for reddening correction, etc.),
the e†ect of this bias on the Ðnal determination of distances
drops signiÐcantly, amounting to only 1% for ALL-
FRAME, and 2% for DoPHOT.
The Ferrarese et al. results are consistent with an
independent study by Saha et al. , who have investigated the e†ects of crowding in the galaxy NGC 4639 (at a
distance of D25 Mpc, the largest distance measured by
either the Key Project or Type Ia supernova teams). For
this galaxy, the crowding bias in single-epoch observations
is found to be 4% (0.07 mag). Saha et al. do not explicitly
extend their results to observations of Cepheids at multiple
epochs, for which, as noted above, the e†ect would be
reduced even further. A di†erent approach to placing limits
on crowding e†ects comes from Gibson et al. and
Ferrarese et al. , who have looked for a correlation
with distance of residuals in the Tully-Fisher relation. No
signiÐcant e†ect is found. Gibson et al. also see no such
systematic e†ects as would be expected for Type Ia supernova peak magnitudes, nor a di†erence in the PC- versus
WFC-based Cepheid distance moduli.
Very di†erent conclusions have recently been reached by
Stanek & Udalski and Mochesjska . These
authors have speciÐcally investigated the inÑuence of blending on the Cepheid distance scale. Blending is the close
association of a Cepheid with one or more intrinsically
luminous stars. Since Cepheids are young stars, they may be
preferentially associated near other young stars. Stanek &
Udalski conclude that this e†ect ranges from a few percent
FREEDMAN ET AL.
for nearby galaxies to D15%È20% for galaxies at 25 Mpc.
However, the Stanek & Udalski results are based on an
extrapolation from high surface brightness regions in the
bar of the LMC, and they do not make use of photometric
reduction programs (such as DoPHOT and ALLFRAME),
which are designed for photometry in crowded Ðelds. These
authors simply sum additional contributions to the total
Ñux to simulate crowding. Moreover, they do not allow for
underlying background contamination, which becomes
increasingly important for galaxies at larger distances.
Hence, at present, it is not possible to compare these results
directly to the analysis of
Key Project data.
In a comparison of ground-based images of M31 with
HST images, Mochejska et al. found that the median
V -band Ñux contribution from luminous companions was
about 12% of the Ñux of the Cepheid. They argued that
ground-based resolution in M31 corresponds to HST
resolution at about 10 Mpc, and that blending will lead to
systematically low distances for galaxies at such distances.
A more recent study by this group for the galaxy M33,
which has a much larger sample of stars, indicates that this
e†ect amounts to only about 7% .
The exact size of this e†ect will depend on the true underlying distribution of stars in the frame, and the extent to
which the actual Cepheids being measured are a†ected. We
note that the galaxies with HST Cepheid distances for
which blending e†ects are likely to be most severe are the
inner Ðeld of M101, the high surface brightness galaxy NGC
3627, and the most distant galaxies searched, for example
To assess quantitatively the impact of unresolved blending e†ects on the Ðnal Cepheid distances would require
simulations based on the distribution of Cepheids in a
galaxy Ðeld una†ected by blending. This distribution could
be scaled with distance and inserted at the same surface
brightness levels encountered in each of the Cepheid target
frames, and then recovered using the same techniques as
used originally to analyze the original data frames. Ideally,
several input distributions could be tested. Such a study is
beyond the scope of the present paper, but has been applied,
for example, to the Cepheids observed in M101 with
NICMOS .
Naive tests, which, for example, assume constant surface
brightness between the Cepheid Ðelds in nearby and distant
galaxies, will not, in general, correctly simulate the Key
Project, for which generally low surface brightness Ðelds
were deliberately selected. Examination of the statistics of
the number densities of stars in the vicinity of Cepheids in
the Key Project frames bear this out. For the present, we
view the 2% e†ect measured by Ferrarese et al. as a
lower limit on the e†ects of crowding and blending, and
adopt a conservative uncertainty of ]5%, [0% (1 p).
8.5.1. Contamination from Companion Stars
We note that Cepheids can be located in binary systems,
and the presence of true, physical companions has been
established for Cepheids in both the Galaxy and the LMC.
For Cepheids in the Galaxy, as well as for early (B-type)
stars, the mass distribution of companions has been studied
intensively, and is strongly peaked toward low masses . The presence of binaries will add increased
scatter to the underlying period-luminosity relation, including that for the LMC, where the binaries are unresolved.
However, unless the frequency of Cepheid binaries varies
signiÐcantly from galaxy to galaxy, the relative distances to
galaxies will be una†ected.
8.6. Does the Measured Value of
ReÑect the True,
Global Value?
Locally, variations in the expansion rate due to largescale velocities make measurement of the true value of H0
problematic. Thus, for an accurate determination of
large enough volume must be observed to provide a fair
sample of the universe over which to average. How large is
large enough? Both theory and observations can provide
constraints.
A number of theoretical studies have addressed this question recently. Given a model for structure formation, and
therefore a predicted power spectrum for density Ñuctuations, local measurements of
can be compared with the
global value of
 . Many variations of cold dark matter (CDM) models have been investigated, and issues of both the required volume and sample
size for the distance indicator have been addressed. The
most recent models predict that variations at the level of
are to be expected for the current
S(dH/H0)2T1@2
(small) samples of Type Ia supernovae that probe out to
40,000 km s~1, whereas for methods that extend only to
10,000 km s~1, for small samples, the cosmic variation is
predicted to be 2%È4%.
There are also observational constraints that can test the
possibility that we live in an underdense region locally.
These include the observational determinations that the
expansion is linear on 100È1000 Mpc scales, and measurements of temperature Ñuctuations in the cosmic microwave
background. The linearity of the Hubble diagram has been
established by many means, including work by Sandage &
Hardy and Lauer & Postman on brightest
cluster galaxies, recent studies of supernovae at velocity distances out to 30,000 km s~1 , and extension of the Tully Fisher relation to 15,000 km s~1
 . These results limit
the di†erence between the global and local values of the
Hubble constant to a few percent. For example, Giovanelli
et al. provide limits to the amplitude of a possible distortion
H \ 0.010 ^ 0.022. The rarity of low-density bubbles is also
attested by the microwave dipole anisotropy on degree
scales. Wang et al. Ðnd a robust upper limit on the
global deviation from the local 104 km s~1 sphere of 10.5%
with 95% conÐdence.

well understood before dn/n can be determined. Improved
constraints will soon be forthcoming from the Two-Degree
Field (2dF), Sloan, 2 Micron All-Sky (2MASS), and 6dF
The overall conclusion derived from these studies is that
uncertainties due to inhomogeneities in the galaxy distribution likely a†ect determinations of
only at the few
percent level. This must be reÑected in the total uncertainty
however, the current distance indicators are now
being applied to sufficiently large depths, and in many independent directions, that large errors due to this source of
uncertainty are statistically unlikely. These constraints will
tighten in the near future as larger numbers of supernovae
are discovered, when all-sky measurements of the CMB
anisotropies are made at smaller angular scales, and when
deeper redshift surveys have been completed.
8.7. Overall Assessment of Systematic Uncertainties
We now brieÑy summarize the sources of systematic error
discussed in the previous section. The standard error of the
mean for the zero point of the LMC PL relation is ^0.06
mag, and is currently set by an average over several independent methods. Conservatively, we adopt a value of ^0.1
mag, corresponding to ^5% in the uncertainty for the distance to the LMC. Systematic errors in the reddening determinations are small, amounting to less than 1%. Both
observational and theoretical studies of Cepheids suggest
that there is a small metallicity dependence of the PL relation. Cepheid galaxies have a range of metallicities that are
in the mean a few tenths of a dex greater that of the LMC.
Adopting a metallicity correction results in values of H0
that are lower in the mean by 4%. We take this di†erence
between corrected and uncorrected distances to be indicative of the uncertainty due to metallicity. Cepheid distances
can be a†ected by incompleteness biases at the few percent
level, but these are minimized by adopting a conservative
choice for the lower period limit, and by the fact that the
dispersion in the reddening-corrected PL relation is only
^0.08 mag. Ultimately, this sample bias e†ect contributes
less than ^1% uncertainty to the Ðnal results. Based on
artiÐcial star experiments, crowding e†ects on the Ðnal distances also contribute at a 1%È2% level. Allowing for unresolved blending e†ects, we adopt an overall uncertainty of
]5%, [0%. Finally, based on a number of both empirical
and theoretical studies, bulk motions on very large scales
are likely to contribute less than ^5%.
Correcting for the e†ects of bias and metallicity decrease
by 1% and 4%, respectively, whereas the e†ect of the
new WFPC2 zero point is to increase
by 3.5%. The
e†ect of adopting the new Udalski et al. PL slopes
di†ers from galaxy to galaxy (and therefore di†ers in the
magnitude of the e†ect on the zero point for each secondary
method). Adopting the new slopes results in a mean
decrease in distance from the Madore & Freedman 
calibration of 7% for the galaxies listed in Table 3, but each
individual method is impacted slightly di†erently depending on what subset of calibrators is applicable to that
method. The sign of the uncertainty due to a possible bulk-
Ñow component to the velocity Ðeld is, of course, unknown.
In this paper, we have not applied a correction for crowding, but incorporate this uncertainty into the Ðnal error
budget. These corrections individually amount to a few
percent, but with di†ering signs so that the overall impact
on the mean value of the Hubble constant agree at the 1%
level with those in Mould et al. and Freedman
We list the major identiÐed systematic uncertainties in
Table 14; these can be combined in quadrature to yield an
overall systematic uncertainty of ^10% (or 7 km s~1
Mpc~1). Our current
value incorporates four reÐne-
ments discussed in detail above: (1) adopting the slopes of
the PL relations as given by Udalski et al. , (2) using
the WFPC2 photometric zero-point calibration of Stetson
 , (3) applying a metallicity correction of [0.2 ^ 0.2
mag dex~1, and (4) correcting for bias in the PL relation.
Applying the resulting Cepheid calibration to Ðve secondary methods gives

FROM METHODS INDEPENDENT OF CEPHEIDS
A detailed discussion of other methods is beyond the
scope of this paper; however, we brieÑy compare our results
with two other methods: the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) technique, and measurement of time delays for gravitational
lenses. Both of these methods are entirely independent of
the local extragalactic distance scale, and they can be
applied directly at large distances. Currently their accuracies are not yet as high as has recently been achieved for
the classical distance measurements, but both methods hold
considerable promise for the future. We show in Figure 7
published based on these two methods from
1991 to the present.

9.2. T ime Delays for Gravitational L enses
A second method for measuring
at very large dis-
tances, independent of the need for any local calibration,
comes from gravitational lenses. Refsdal 
showed that a measurement of the time delay, and the
angular separation for gravitationally lensed images of a
variable object, such as a quasar, can be used to provide a
measurement of
 . Difficulties with this method stem from
the fact that the underlying (luminous or dark) mass distributions of the lensing galaxies are not independently
known. Furthermore, the lensing galaxies may be sitting in
more complicated group or cluster potentials. A degeneracy
exists between the mass distribution of the lens and the
 . In the case of the
well-studied lens 0957]561, the degeneracy due to the surrounding cluster can be broken with the addition of weaklensing
constraints.

in the mass models for both the galaxy and the cluster

masses, baryon fractions, and weak-lensing studies all have
provided increasingly strong evidence for a low matter
universe . In addi-
tion, strong new evidence for a Ñat universe has emerged
from measurements of the position of the Ðrst acoustic peak
in recent cosmic microwave background anisotropy experiments . Together
with evidence for a low matter density, and with recent data
from high-redshift supernovae , evidence for a nonzero cosmological constant
has been increasing. Moreover, the age estimates for globular clusters have been revised downward to 12È13 Gyr,
based on a new calibration from the Hipparcos satellite
 . A nonzero value of
the cosmological constant helps to avoid a discrepancy
between the expansion age and other age estimates. For

11. SUMMARY
We have used HST to measure Cepheid distances to 18
nearby spiral galaxies. Based on a new, larger sample of
calibrating Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud, an
improved photometric calibration for the HST Wide Field
and Planetary Camera 2, attention to incompleteness bias
in the Cepheid period-luminosity relation, and a correction
for Cepheid metallicity, we have presented here a set of
self-consistent, revised Cepheid distances to 31 galaxies. The
total sample includes previously published ground-based
photometry, and additional HST
studies. The relative
Cepheid distances are determined to D^5%.
Calibrating Ðve secondary methods with these revised
Cepheid distances, we Ðnd

MAGNITUDE-LIMITED BIAS
We present here an analytic derivation of the bias introduced into the PL Ðts imposed by magnitude-limited cuts on
extragalactic Cepheid samples. We note that in ° 3.4, the application of short-period cuts to the observed PL relations (to
compensate for this bias) resulted in slightly increased moduli. Depending on the sample size and its period distribution, these
empirical corrections ranged from \1% up to 4% in distance. We now provide an analytic solution to reinforce our
understanding of the degree and direction of this bias.
Consider Figure 10, which is meant to represent a uniform distribution of Cepheids deÐning a period-luminosity relation of
Ðnite width CD. It is clear that the data set deÐned by the parallelogram ABMN will be unbiased with respect to a Ðt EF
(dashed ridgeline), where EF has the predeÐned slope. It is Ðtted to the data distribution within ABMN using least squares,
assuming that all of the variance is in the vertical direction, and that errors on the periods are negligible.
Now if a magnitude-limiting cuto† to the Cepheid data is imposed (by line GH), it is clear that an asymmetry in the data
distribution will be introduced with a bias in the Ðtted zero point ensuing: the region ACD is uncompensated for by the
exclusion of its complementary region ADB. Of course, the full bias introduced by ACD will depend on the relative numbers

of stars in this section as compared to those in the unbiased area. However, if the section ACD is uniformly populated it can
be shown that a Ðxed-slope solution (to that portion only) Ðtted by least squares would introduce a bias toward brighter
magnitudes by an amount *m \ w/6, where w is the full magnitude width (measured at Ðxed period) of the instability strip.
The minimization of the least-squares conditioning,
wB(x [ x0)2 dxD \ 0
such that the di†erence between the biased solution
and the unbiased solution at w/2 is
x0 [ w/2 \ [w/6.
For the reddening-free W -PL relation, where the Key Project Ðtting is done, the intrinsic scatter in the relation is p \ 0.08
mag , giving w \ 4p D 0.3 mag, and a predicted (maximum) bias of 0.05 mag, or less than about 3% in
distance. This bias term will of course be diluted in direct proportion to the relative numbers of stars outside the biased zone.
This is in complete agreement with the quantitative corrections found in the main text, where the typical correction is ]0.02
mag, with the largest correction leading to an increase of 4% in distance.
