Retrieval processes in the long-term recognition of well organized material showed the expected
organizational effects on "slow" recognition responses. Ss sorted 100 words into two to seven categories
until a stable organization was achieved. The data showed the usual correlations between organization
(number of categories used) and recall and recognition. Recognition tests a week after the sorting task
revealed no differences between Ss using many or few categories for the "fast" recognition responses,
defined as the faster 50% of each S's latency distribution. The organizational effect was clearly evident
for the "slow" 50% of the responses. The data support the retrieval check hypothesis in recognition
under the assumption that retrieval operations take additional time during the recognition process.
The belief that recognition
of an event and its
fundamentally
memorial processes has characterized the mainstream of
psychological research and, as recently as 1970, Kintsch
stated that the "familiarity value of an item together
completely
determine the recognition response
[1970, p. 243] ."
When retrieval factors have been admitted as relevant
variables, they have been considered sporadic in their
effect, which in turn has been described as minor and
unimportant. However, the notion that recognition is
usually based only on. some familiarity value or on
occurrence information can be shown to be empirically
inadequate and also intuitively inappropriate. The usual
response to one's inability to recognize a face or a name
that one has "surely met before" is to search one's
memory under the appropriate and possible categories
and contexts.
Following the demonstration that recall of lists of
words is a linear function of the number of categories
words are categorized , Mandler, Pearlstone,
and Koopmans also showed that recognition is
similarly a function of the categorical organization of
the input material. At that time and in a subsequent
elaboration , we presented a theoretical

category of the to-be-recognized item and a comparison
between that item and a draw of approximately five
items (the number usually available in retrieval) from the
stored category. If there is a match, the item is called
"old"; if not, it is called "new." Given an input list of
constant size, the more categories used to divide the list,
the smaller the categories will be and the more likely the
retrieval check will provide a match and a correct "old"
response. The general notion that retrieval strategies are

The basic design of this study is similar to our previous work
 . Ss sorted 100 words into two to seven
categories, with the choice of number of categories left to the Ss.
On the basis of prior evidence and in order to accentuate
organizational effects, only
11 Ss who used three or four
categories (Group 34) and 10 who used six or seven categories
(Group 67) were used. The problem of S selection involved in
this procedure has been extensively discussed in Mandler .

by assigning categories or by letting Ss select the number they
choose and since the relationship can be shown to hold in
within-S designs , one can now safely use
whatever method is most appropriate and be certain of the
generality of the effect across or within Ss.
Two sets of 100 words with a Thorndike-Lorge frequency of
AA were selected. Thirteen of the Ss sorted one set of words,
eight Ss sorted the other, and the final recognition task consisted
of all 200 words. In Session I Ss were presented with a deck of
3 x 5 in. cards with the 100 words and seven bins. They were
instructed to sort the words into any number of categories up to
seven by putting words together that semantically "belonged
together." After each sort, the deck was thoroughly shuffled and
returned to the S. Sorting was continued until two consecutive
sorts showed a 95% overlap in the category assignment of the
words. The Ss were then
asked to return for a different
experiment in I week's time. At the start of Session 2, Ss were
told that they would be given a variety of tasks, all of which
required making yes/no judgments. Two initial tasks involving
trigram recognition and a simple arithmetic task were given to
familiarize the Ss with the apparatus. They are not relevant to
the present analysis. For the recognition task which followed,
the Ss were told that they were going to be presented with 200
words, one at a time, and they were required to respond YES if
it was a word that they had sorted in Session I and NO if it was
not. Ss faced a VR-12 video display with two response boxes in
front of them. One box had two buttons labeled YES and NO
and a READY button. The second box had three buttons labeled
VERY SURE, FAIRLY SURE, and NOT SURE. A PDP-12
controlled
responses, and
measured response latencies to the nearest hundredth of a
second. A ***READY*** appeared on the screen and remained
on until the S pressed the READY button, and 1.5 sec later a
test item was displayed. Once the S had made the YES/NO
choice, the item was replaced with the instruction INDICATE

Group 67 (p < .05). The correlation between number of
categories used and d' was .49 (p < .05), which is the
same low but significant correlation found previously
 .
The major prediction based on the retrieval check
theory was that recognition
performance would be
significantly different for the slow latency responses.
These presumably involve the retrieval check which
would be more successful for Group 67. Fast latencies
should show no differences between the two groups.
Since there is no a priori definition of "slow" and "fast"
latencies, we successively defined portions of each S's
distribution
as "fast" or "slow" responses,
moving from the fastest 10% of the distribution to 30%
50%; this procedure correspondingly defines as
"slow" responses 90%, 70%, and 50% of each S's
distribu tion. Figure I shows the median d' values for the
two experimental groups for each of the subsets of the
latency distribution. Median values were used because
the performance of some Ss on their "fast" responses
(i.e., 100% hit rate and/or 0% false alarms) yielded
indeterminately high d' values. Clearly, recognition is
better for "fast" than for "slow" responses overall.
However, and in keeping with the prediction, the two
groups' recognition performance is indistinguishable for
definitions of "fast," while for the slow
responses a Mann-Whitney U test showed significant or
near significant differences (p < .10 for 90%, < .05 for
.05 for 50% slow responses). As a first
approximation, the boundary between a simple decision
process and a retrieval check can be assumed to be at the
50% point of each S's distribution of latencies. Another
argument for a qualitative difference between slow and
fast recognition processes is a low and nonsignificant
rank order correlation of .19 between Ss' d' values on
the fast 50% and the slow 50% of responses.
