Computational de novo design of new drugs and materials requires rigorous and unbiased exploration
of chemical compound space. However, large uncharted territories persist due to its size scaling
combinatorially with molecular size. We report computed geometric, energetic, electronic, and
thermodynamic properties for 134k stable small organic molecules made up of CHONF. These molecules
correspond to the subset of all 133,885 species with up to nine heavy atoms (CONF) out of the GDB-17
chemical universe of 166 billion organic molecules. We report geometries minimal in energy, corresponding
harmonic frequencies, dipole moments, polarizabilities, along with energies, enthalpies, and free energies
of atomization. All properties were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of quantum chemistry.
Furthermore, for the predominant stoichiometry, C7H10O2, there are 6,095 constitutional isomers among
the 134k molecules. We report energies, enthalpies, and free energies of atomization at the more accurate
G4MP2 level of theory for all of them. As such, this data set provides quantum chemical properties for a
relevant, consistent, and comprehensive chemical space of small organic molecules. This database may
serve the benchmarking of existing methods, development of new methods, such as hybrid quantum
mechanics/machine learning, and systematic identiﬁcation of structure-property relationships.

Background & summary
The goal of computationally designing novel materials and molecules with desired physicochemical
properties is yet to be achieved. High-throughput screening represents the most straightforward approach
towards materials design1. However, it presupposes that all assumptions and approximations inherent to
the employed modeling techniques are applicable to the entire chemical compound space, which is the
space populated by all stable molecules or materials2. Furthermore, due to the combinatorial scaling of
chemical space with molecular size, it is difﬁcult to explore or even navigate. Conclusive insights about
the domain of applicability (transferability) are lacking even for the most popular ﬁrst principle quantum
chemistry methods. For example, the reliability and accuracy of density functional theory is known to
dramatically depend on chemical composition and atomistic conﬁgurations3, highlighting the importance
of reliable experimental4 or high-level quantum chemistry state-of-the-art results5,6. Unfortunately, the
systems reported are typically small, which implies the existence of severe selection bias. One can
therefore question how representative they are. The problem of representative diversity has triggered the
design of special purpose chemical space libraries for method validation or molecular design7–10.
Here, we report molecular structures and properties obtained from quantum chemistry calculations
for the ﬁrst 134k molecules of the chemical universe GDB-17 data base11, covering a molecular property
set of unprecedented size and consistency. The data-set corresponds to the GDB-9 subset of all neutral
molecules with up to nine atoms (CONF), not counting hydrogen. The molecular size distribution of all
134k molecules is shown in Fig. 1. This data set contains small amino acids, such as GLY, ALA, as well as
nucleobases cytosine, uracil, and thymine. Also pharmaceutically relevant organic building blocks, such
as pyruvic acid, piperazine, or hydroxy urea are included. Among the 134k molecules, there are
621 stoichiometries, among which C7H10O2 dominates with 6,095 constitutional isomers for which
atomization energies and radii of gyration also are on display in Fig. 1.
For all 134k molecules, we have calculated equilibrium geometries, frontier orbital eigenvalues, dipole
moments, harmonic frequencies, polarizabilities, and thermochemical energetics corresponding to
atomization energies, enthalpies, and entropies at ambient temperature. These properties have been
obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of theory which forms the basis for the more accurate state-ofthe art Gn methods which are on par with experimental accuracy12. For the 6,095 constitutional isomers
of the predominant stoichiometry, C7H10O2, we report the energetics at the signiﬁcantly more accurate
G4MP212 level of theory.
This report is structured as follows. We ﬁrst describe the genesis of the results. Thereafter, we discuss
the validation of our DFT results by comparison to (i) G4MP2, (ii) G4, and (iii) CBS-QB3 results for
Figure 1. Illustration of the scaling of chemical space with system size. For the smallest 134k molecules,
with up to 9 heavy atoms CONF (not counting hydrogens) taken from the chemical universe GDB-1711, the
distribution of molecular size is shown as a function of number of occupied electron orbitals, i.e. number of
electron pairs, Nep = Ne/2. Each black box denotes the number of constitutional isomers for one out of the
621 stoichiometries present in the 134k molecules. The two left-hand side insets correspond to zoom-ins for
smaller compounds. The right-hand side inset zooms in on the predominant stoichiometry, C7H10O2, and
features a scatter plot of G4MP2 relative (w.r.t. global minimum) potential energies of atomization E versus
molecular radius of gyration, Rg. Joined projected distributions are shown as well.

100 molecules, randomly chosen out of the 134k set. This data can serve the development, training and
evaluation of inductive statistical data analysis-based machine learning (ML) models13. It might also
assist the search and discovery of hitherto unknown trends, structure-property relationships, and
molecular materials design1,14,15.
Generation of atomic coordinates
Starting with ref. 11, we use all SMILES16 strings for molecules with up to nine heavy atoms. Cations,
anions, and molecules containing S, Br, Cl, or I, have been excluded, resulting in 133,885 molecules. 1,705
zwitterions have been kept in the data due to their occurrence in small biomolecules, such as amino acids.
Initial Cartesian coordinates for all molecules were generated by parsing the corresponding SMILES
strings using Corina 17. We subsequently carried out geometry relaxations at the
PM7 semi-empirical level of theory using MOPAC 18. In the PM7 calculations, we
invoked tight electronic and geometric convergence thresholds, using precise keyword. PM7
equilibrium geometries have subsequently been used as input for B3LYP geometry relaxations using
Gaussian 0919. We iteratively reﬁned the electronic and geometry thresholds. For the ﬁrst iteration,
Gaussian 09’s default electronic and geometry thresholds have been used for all molecules. For those
molecules which failed to reach SCF convergence ultrafine grids have been invoked within a second
iteration for evaluating the XC energy contributions. Within a third iteration on the remaining
unconverged molecules, we identiﬁed those which had relaxed to saddle points, and further tightened the
SCF criteria using the keyword scf(maxcycle = 200, verytight). All those molecules which
still featured imaginary frequencies entered the fourth iteration using keywords, opt(calcfc,
maxstep= 5, maxcycles = 1000). calcfc constructs a Hessian in the ﬁrst step of the
geometry relaxation for eigenvector following. Within the ﬁfth and ﬁnal iteration, all molecules
which still failed to reach convergence, have subsequently been converged using opt(calcall,
maxstep = 1, maxcycles = 1000). calcall constructs a Hessian for all steps through the
the geometry relaxation. After all these measures taken, eleven problematic molecules still failed to
converge to a minimal geometry. Out of these eleven molecules, six can be converged with low threshold
using the opt(loose)-keyword. In the remaining ﬁve there were two near-linear molecules which
converged to saddle points with very low imaginary frequencies (ω0oi10 cm −1 for the lowest mode). In
the readme.txt ﬁle of this report, all these 11 molecules are speciﬁed using their indices in the
In the case of the 6,095 constitutional isomers of C7H10O2, all molecules converged to local minima
during the B3LYP geometry relaxation. To compute atomization energies, we have also performed spinunrestricted calculations for all atoms with spin-multiplicities 2,3,4,3,2 for the atoms H, C, N, O, F,
respectively.
Data Records
Molecular structures and properties are publicly available at Figshare (Data Citation 1) in a plain text
XYZ-like format described below. Deposited ﬁles include the 133, 885 GDB-1 to GDB-9 molecules
(dsgdb9nsd.xyz.tar.bz2), the 6,095 constitutional isomers of C7H10O2 (dsC7O2H10nsd.
xyz.tar.bz2), the 100 validation molecules (see Table 1) enthalpies of atomization (validation.txt), and atomic reference data (atomref.txt).
File format
For each molecule, atomic coordinates and calculated properties are stored in a ﬁle named
dataset_index.xyz. The XYZ format (originally developed for the XMol program by the
Minnesota Supercomputer Center) is a widespread plain text format for encoding Cartesian coordinates
of molecules, with no formal speciﬁcation. It contains a header line specifying the number of atoms na, a
comment line, and na lines containing element type and atomic coordinates, one atom per line. We have
extended this format as indicated in Table 2. Now, the comment line is used to store all scalar properties,

Properties
All molecular geometries were relaxed, and properties calculated, at the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level
of theory. The list of properties of the 134k molecules is summarized in Table 3. For a subset of 6,095
isomers of C7H10O2, energetics (properties 12–16) were additionally calculated at the G4MP2 level of
theory. For a validation set of 100 randomly drawn molecules from the 133,885 GDB-9 set, enthalpies of
atomization were calculated at the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p), G4MP2, G4 and CBS-QB3 levels of theory.

‘IUPAC International Chemical Identiﬁer’. The resulting strings have been compared to the InChI strings
obtained from the initial Cartesian coordinates (generated by Corina using the original GDB-17 SMILES
strings). See Fig. 2 for a ﬂow-chart of this consistency check. Out of the 134k molecules, 3,054 molecules
did not pass this test. This is due to the fact that SMILES and InChI representations are not unique
because transformation of Cartesian coordinates to string based chemical identiﬁers is prone to
implementation speciﬁc artifacts. For molecules with same topology, small differences in interatomic
distances, bond and dihedral angles can lead to different molecular graphs encoded by the string. To
quantify this artifact, the distribution of Coulomb-matrix distances13, DIJ [Hartree], using the Manhattan
or L1 metric, between Corina generated Cartesian coordinates (see Fig. 2) and B3LYP coordinates is on
display in Fig. 3 for all the 3,054 molecules.
Consider, for example, molecule indexed 58 in the 134k set, which is among the 3,054 molecules for
which the consistency check failed. Its original GDB-17 SMILES corresponds to NC( = N)C#N, and

Cartesian coordinates can be generated using Corina. When feeding back these coordinates to Open
Babel to perform the inverse task of reproducing the initial SMILES string, [NH]C( = [NH2])C#N is
obtained instead. By contrast, performing ﬁrst a geometry relaxation of the Corina generated Cartesian
coordinates using PM7 followed by B3LYP, and only then parsing through Open Babel, recovers the
original SMILES string. In this case, DIJ using the Coulomb-matrices of Corina and B3LYP geometries is
rather small (~27 Ha) when compared to distances between geometries of other failed molecules, see
distance distribution plot in Fig. 3. By contrast, failed molecules with large DIJ between Corina and
B3LYP geometries, see Fig. 3, correspond to molecules for which the B3LYP relaxation induces dramatic
distortion with signiﬁcant alteration and rearrangement of covalent bonding patterns. As a result, parsing
back these geometries with Open Babel yields different SMILES strings. Note that all the 6,095
constitutional isomers of C7H10O2 for which G4MP2 calculations have been performed, passed this
geometry consistency check, shown as a ﬂow-chart in Fig. 2.
Validation of quantum chemistry results
All 134k molecules have been modeled using B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) based DFT. Previously, B3LYP has
been validated for several subsets, containing up to a few hundred small molecules. These benchmarks are
of limited use since they are not necessarily sufﬁciently representative for gauging B3LYP’s performance
in general. In the case of DFT’s systematic errors this issue is particularly pertinent22. Experimental data
assembled in the NIST database is very sparse by comparison to our 134k organic molecules made up of
CHONF atoms. Consequently, we have performed additional benchmark calculations for a subset of 100
randomly selected molecules using high level theories G4MP212, G423, and CBS-QB324,25.
The predictive power of the G4MP2 method is widely considered to be on par with experimental
uncertainties. For example, comparison to the G3/05 test set26,27 with 454 experimental energies
(including enthalpies of formation, ionization potentials, electron afﬁnities, proton afﬁnities, and
hydrogen bond energies) of small molecules yields MAE, and RMSE of 1.0, and 1.5 kcal/mol,
respectively12. For the same properties and molecules, the slightly more accurate, and considerably more
expensive method G412,23 yields errors of MAE = 0.8 kcal/mol, RMSE = 1.2 kcal/mol. G4MP2 has been
shown to deviate only by 1.4 kcal/mol from 261 bond dissociation enthalpies computed with the highly
accurate W1w composite procedure28,29 for the BDE261 data set28. Consequently, we believe these
calculations to be sufﬁciently suitable to validate the quality of the B3LYP energetics predictions. Various
resulting deviations are summarized in Table 1. For the 100 molecules, the mean absolute error of B3LYP
heats of atomization amounts to no more than 5 kcal/mol.
