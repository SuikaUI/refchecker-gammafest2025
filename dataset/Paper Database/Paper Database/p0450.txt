Covid-19 — Navigating the Uncharted
Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., H. Clifford Lane, M.D., and Robert R. Redfield, M.D.
The latest threat to global health is the ongoing
outbreak of the respiratory disease that was recently given the name Coronavirus Disease 2019
(Covid-19). Covid-19 was recognized in December 2019.1 It was rapidly shown to be caused by
a novel coronavirus that is structurally related to
the virus that causes severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS). As in two preceding instances
of emergence of coronavirus disease in the past
18 years2 — SARS and Middle
East respiratory syndrome (MERS) — the Covid-19 outbreak has posed
critical challenges for the public health, research,
and medical communities.
In their Journal article, Li and colleagues3 provide a detailed clinical and epidemiologic description of the first 425 cases reported in the
epicenter of the outbreak: the city of Wuhan in
Hubei province, China. Although this information is critical in informing the appropriate response to this outbreak, as the authors point
out, the study faces the limitation associated with
reporting in real time the evolution of an emerging pathogen in its earliest stages. Nonetheless,
a degree of clarity is emerging from this report.
The median age of the patients was 59 years,
with higher morbidity and mortality among the
elderly and among those with coexisting conditions (similar to the situation with influenza);
56% of the patients were male. Of note, there
were no cases in children younger than 15 years
of age. Either children are less likely to become
infected, which would have important epidemiologic implications, or their symptoms were so
mild that their infection escaped detection,
which has implications for the size of the denominator of total community infections.
On the basis of a case definition requiring a
diagnosis of pneumonia, the currently reported
case fatality rate is approximately 2%.4 In another article in the Journal, Guan et al.5 report
mortality of 1.4% among 1099 patients with
laboratory-confirmed Covid-19; these patients had
a wide spectrum of disease severity. If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high
as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%. This
suggests that the overall clinical consequences
of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to
those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has
a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a
pandemic influenza rather than a disease similar to SARS
or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of
9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.2
The efficiency of transmission for any respiratory virus has important implications for containment and mitigation strategies. The current
study indicates an estimated basic reproduction
number (R0) of 2.2, which means that, on average, each infected person spreads the infection
to an additional two persons. As the authors
note, until this number falls below 1.0, it is
likely that the outbreak will continue to spread.
Recent reports of high titers of virus in the oropharynx early in the course of disease arouse
concern about increased infectivity during the
period of minimal symptoms.6,7
China, the United States, and several other
countries have instituted temporary restrictions
on travel with an eye toward slowing the spread
of this new disease within China and throughout the rest of the world. The United States has
seen a dramatic reduction in the number of travelers from China, especially from Hubei province.

At least on a temporary basis, such restrictions
may have helped slow the spread of the virus:
whereas 78,191 laboratory-confirmed cases had
been identified in China as of February 26, 2020,
a total of 2918 cases had been confirmed in 37
other countries or territories.4 As of February 26,
2020, there had been 14 cases detected in the
United States involving travel to China or close
contacts with travelers, 3 cases among U.S. citizens
repatriated from China, and 42 cases among
U.S. passengers repatriated from a cruise ship
where the infection had spread.8 However, given
the efficiency of transmission as indicated in the
current report, we should be prepared for Covid-19
to gain a foothold throughout the world, including in the United States. Community spread in
the United States could require a shift from containment to mitigation strategies such as social
distancing in order to reduce transmission. Such
strategies could include isolating ill persons
(including voluntary isolation at home), school
closures, and telecommuting where possible.9
A robust research effort is currently under
way to develop a vaccine against Covid-19.10 We
anticipate that the first candidates will enter
phase 1 trials by early spring. Therapy currently
consists of supportive care while a variety of
investigational approaches are being explored.11
Among these are the antiviral medication lopin­
avir–ritonavir, interferon-1β, the RNA polymer­ase
inhibitor remdesivir, chloroquine, and a variety of
traditional Chinese medicine products.11 Once
available, intravenous hyperimmune globulin
from recovered persons and monoclonal antibodies may be attractive candidates to study in early
intervention. Critical to moving the field forward, even in the context of an outbreak, is ensuring that investigational products are evaluated
in scientifically and ethically sound studies.12
Every outbreak provides an opportunity to
gain important information, some of which is
associated with a limited window of opportunity.
For example, Li et al. report a mean interval of
9.1 to 12.5 days between the onset of illness and
hospitalization. This finding of a delay in the
progression to serious disease may be telling us
something important about the pathogenesis of
this new virus and may provide a unique window of opportunity for intervention. Achieving a
better understanding of the pathogenesis of this
disease will be invaluable in navigating our responses in this uncharted arena. Furthermore,
genomic studies could delineate host factors
that predispose persons to acquisition of infection and disease progression.
The Covid-19 outbreak is a stark reminder of
the ongoing challenge of emerging and reemerging infectious pathogens and the need for constant surveillance, prompt diagnosis, and robust
research to understand the basic biology of new
organisms and our susceptibilities to them, as
well as to develop effective countermeasures.
