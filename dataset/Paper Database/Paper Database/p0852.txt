PROLOCUTION
It will be no strange thing at all for some to dislike
the matter of this work, and others to be displeased
with the manner and method of it. Easily can I forsee
that my account will be too long and tedious for some,
while others, perhaps, may be apt to complain of its
being too short and concise.
Edmund Calamy
It is thought as necessary to write a
Preface before a Book, as it is judged
civil, when you invite a Friend to
Dinner, to proffer him a Glass of Hock
beforehand for a Whet.
John Arbuthnot, from the preface
to his translation of Huygens's
"De Ratiociniis in Ludo Alooe".
Prompted by an awareness of the importance of Bayesian ideas in modern
statistical theory and practice, I decided some years ago to undertake a
study of the development and growth of such ideas. At the time it seemed
appropriate to begin such an investigation with an examination of Bayes's
Essay towards solving a problem in the doctrine of chances and Laplace's
Theorie analytique des probabilites, and then to pass swiftly on to a brief
consideration of other nineteenth century works before turning to what
would be the main topic of the treatise, videlicet the rise of Bayesian statistics from the 1950's to the present day.
It soon became apparent, however, that the amount of Bayesian work
published was such that a thorough investigation of the topic up to the
1980's would require several volumes and also run the risk of incurring
the wrath of extant authors whose writings would no doubt be misrepresented, or at least be so described. It seemed wise, therefore, to restrict
the period and the subject under study in some way, and I decided to concentrate my attention on inverse probability from Thomas Bayes to Karl
Pearson was born in 1857 and died in 1936, and in a sense a watershed in
statistics was reached during his lifetime. The somewhat cavalier approach
to inverse probability that one finds in many writings in the century following the publication of Bayes's Essay was succeeded in the fullness of time
(even if destined only by Tyche) by the logical and personal approach to
probability grounded on the works of Jeffreys, Johnson, Keynes, Ramsey
and Wrinch in the first third of this century (and Jeffreys in fact gained
his inspiration from Pearson's Grammar of Science). At roughly the same
time Fisher was making himself a statistical force indeed, one can perhaps view the rigorous development of Bayes's work into a statistical tool
to be reckoned with as a reaction to Fisher's evolution of sampling theory.
The thirties also saw the birth of the Neyman-Pearson (and later Wald)
decision-theoretic school, and subsequent work of this school was later incorporated into the Bayesian set-up, to the distinct advantage of both.
One must also note the rise of the biometric school, in which Pearson
of course played a considerable role, and which owed its growth to the appearance of Francis Galton's Natural. Inheritance of 1889 and his work on
correlation. This work also awoke Walter Frank Raphael Weldon's interest
in correlation, and he in turn did much to turn Pearson's thoughts to evolution. W.S. Gosset's work c.1908 foreshadowed an attenuation in inverse
probability, a tendency which was to be reversed only in the mid-twentieth
It would not be too great a violation of the truth to say that, after
roughly the beginning of this century, inverse probability took a back seat
to the biometric, Fisherian and logical schools, from which it would only
rise around 1950 with the work of Good and Savage and the recognition of
the relevance of de Finetti's earlier studies. Pearson, whose writings cover
both inverse probability and what would today be grouped under "classi-:
cal" methods, seems then to be a suitable person with whom to end this
Todhunter's classic History of the Mathematical Theory of Probability
was published in 1865. For reasons as to which it would be futile to speculate here, nothing in similar vein, and of such depth, appeared for almost a
century (I except books nominally on other topics but containing passages
or chapters on the history of statistics or probability, anthologies of papers on this topic, and works on the history of social or political statistics
and assurances) until David's little gem of 1962. Several works in similar
vein followed, the sequence culminating in Stigler's History of Statistics of
1986 and Hald's History of Probability and Statistics, the latter appearing
in 1990 as the writing of this book nears completion (for trying to write a
preface before the actual text is complete is surely as awkward as trying to
"squeeze a right-hand foot into a left-hand shoe").
Before 1 am carelessly castigated or maliciously maligned let me say what
will not be found here. Firstly, there will be little biographical detail, apart
from that in the first chapter on Thomas Bayes. Secondly, little will be
found in the way of attempt at putting the various matters discussed in the
"correct" historical and sociological context. To interpret early results from
a modern perspective is at best misguided, and I lack the historian's ability,
or artifice, to place myself in the period in which these results were first
presented. Those interested in these aspects will find abundant satisfaction
in the Dictionary of National Biography, the Dictionary of Scientific Biography, and the books by Hald and Stigler cited above. Daston's Classical
Probability in the Enlightenment of 1988 may also be useful: like the work
by Hald it appeared too late to be consulted in the writing of this text.
Our aim is more modest and the captious critic will no doubt opine
with Winston Churchill that there is much to be modest about! It is to
present a record of work on inverse probability (that is, crudely speaking,
the arguing from observed events to the probability of causes) over some
150 years from its generally recognized inception to the rise of its sampletheoretic and logical competitors. Since this is a record, it has been thought
advisable to preserve the original notations and the languages used at
least almost everywhere. For while translations may well help the thoughtful reader, the serious scholar will need the original text to avoid being
misled by the translator's inability to render precise any nuances taxing his
linguistic capabilities.
We have not considered only the most important works published during
the period under consideration: minor writings, sometimes by seldom cited
authors, have also been examined, in order that the effect of the greater
works on the wider community of scholars be also noted. It is to be hoped,
though, that this consideration has not led to a book of which it can be
said, as M.G. Kendall [1963) said of Todhunter's magnum opus, that "it is
just about as dull as any book on probability could be."
It is not claimed that this is the history of inverse probability: rather, it
is one man's view of the topic, a view, it is hoped, in which any peculiarities observed will be ascribed to innocent illusion rather than deliberate
delusion, and in which the seeds of future research may be nurtured.
Is there not something essentially diabolical in keeping the impatient reader, even for
one moment, from the joys that await him?

Acknowledgments
Many there are who have had a hand in the completing of this work, even
if only in some small degree. Particular gratitude is due to the following (in
random order): H.W. Johnson, of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, for
providing a copy of Bayes's notebook; C. Carter, of the reference section of
the Library of Congress, and W.J. Bell, Jr., of the American Philosophical
Society, for their search for information on a possible American publication
of Bayes's Essay; J. McLintock, of the archives of the University of Glasgow, for verification of the award of Price's D.O. by Marischal College; J.
Currie, of the special collections department of the library of Edinburgh
University, for her discovery of documents relating to Bayes's attendance
at the College of James the Sixth; and D.V. Lindley, for his providing a
copy of a hitherto unpublished note by L.J. Savage. This note is printed,
by permission of I.R. Savage, as the Appendix to the present work. It has
been edited by D.V. Lindley.
Many too are the librarians who have helped by providing photo-copies
or microfilms of rare items. Their assistance is greatly appreciated.
Then there are the authors who generously provided copies of their papers. Without the benefit of their historical insights I would have found
my task much more difficult.
Financial support during the preparation of this work was provided by
the University of Natal and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The particularly generous grants by the latter facilitated many
overseas trips for the consultation of rare documents, and thus contributed
to the accuracy of the matters reported here.
The department of Philosophy of Cambridge University (and less directly the department of Mathematical Statistics) and the department of
Statistics of the University of Chicago were gracious enough to have me as
a visiting scholar during two sabbaticals: access to their excellent libraries
was a great incentive in pursuing this work.
I am grateful to the following for granting permission for quotation from
the works mentioned: Almqvist & Wiksell, from the paper published in the
