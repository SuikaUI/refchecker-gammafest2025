UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES
The effects of variations in signal probability and varying
degrees of correct feedback on response bias were studied in
a yes-no auditory signal detection task. The main finding
was that the bias towards saying yes was an increasing function of the frequency of signal feedback events, but did not
depend on the correctness of the feedback. Several learning
models coupled with a simple psychophysical and decision
model yielded predictions about overall biases and certain
sequential statistic s. Only one model, which can be
decribed as an "informational" model, gave a good account of
both observed overall biases and sequential statistics. This
model assumes the observer's response bias is strengthened
for the feedback-reinforced response when the observer's
sensory information is ambiguous or is cOtItradicted by the
feedback information.
This report presents an empirical and theoretical

for forced-choice

The main theoretical analysis compares a number
of learning models for response bias. The learning
models assume that the feedback and signal probability conditions lead to trial-by-trial bias adjustments which at asymptote yield statistically stable
The various models differ as to
which psychophysical and trial outcome events are
presumed to occasion adjustments in the bias.
Because the
main interest is response bias, only
a very primitive psychophysical model is employed.
It is assumed that the

can lead to one
of three possible sensory events, or states, in the
subject. The intuitive meaning of the sensory states
is that, for purposes of deciding whether to respond

We relate the psychophysical and the bias models
by combining them with a simple "threshold" decision model. The model is ubiquitous and has been
suggested by a number of workers

evolved from the ordinary "correction for guessing"
threshold model. The particular version we use is

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This report will discuss only the results for the
feedback conditions. A more complete discussion of
the experiment including an analysis of the No Feedback results is given elsewhere .
Preliminary Analysis
the adequency of the
threshold decision model may be had by considering the ROC functions for the hard and easy signal
intensity conditions. Figure 2 shows the ROC functions, plots of the hit rates (proportion of yesses on
signal trials) versus the false-alarm rates (proportion of yesses on noise trials) for all experimental
conditions. The left panel contains points for groups
the hard signal intensity condition, and
right panel contains points for groups run under
the easy signal intensity condition. Each data point
represents the
mean of the
responses of the 15 sa
taken over the final 150 trials of the
experiment.
A preliminary analysis of the data showed that the
false-alarm rates were stable over
at least that part of the data for all conditions. The
2 are linear ROC functions
with slope =1. They were not fit by the best methods
but are shown to illustrate predictions of the theory.
We shall not argue here that these data support
the three-state model over the many other alternatives. However, we do say that a linear function is
reasonable approximation for the obtained range
of hits and false alarms and that the model appears
to be a reasonable framework in which to study the
our experimental variables on response
bias, which we now consider.

Learning Models for the Bias Parameter P
We now consider a class of alternative learning

and the simple psychophysical judgment experiment.
The fundamental notion is that the probability learning experiment may be regarded as a limiting case

trial . For the present
threshold model, the limiting case is one in which

zero and the uncertain state, U, is evoked on every
trial so that the S must guess. All of the learning
models employ simple linear operators which assume
that the value of the bias parameter P on trial n +I,
is a linear function of the value of the bias
parameter on trial n, Pn. Whether the bias increases
or decreases on trial n +1 and the amount of change
