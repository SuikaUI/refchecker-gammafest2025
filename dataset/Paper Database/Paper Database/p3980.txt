Low-frequency thalamocortical oscillations that underlie drowsiness and slow-wave sleep depend on rhythmic inhibition of relay
cells by neurons in the reticular nucleus (RTN) under the inﬂuence
of corticothalamic ﬁbers that branch to innervate RTN neurons and
relay neurons. To generate oscillations, input to RTN predictably
should be stronger so disynaptic inhibition of relay cells overcomes
direct corticothalamic excitation. Amplitudes of excitatory postsynaptic conductances (EPSCs) evoked in RTN neurons by minimal
stimulation of corticothalamic ﬁbers were 2.4 times larger than in
relay neurons, and quantal size of RTN EPSCs was 2.6 times greater.
GluR4-receptor subunits labeled at corticothalamic synapses on
RTN neurons outnumbered those on relay cells by 3.7 times,
providing a basis for differences in synaptic strength.

orticothalamic fibers that arise from layer VI cells in the
cerebral cortex branch to innervate neurons in the reticular
nucleus (RTN) and thalamocortical relay neurons in the underlying thalamus (1, 2) are a powerful influence in the generation
of neuronal synchrony in thalamus and cortex (3). In RTN and
relay nuclei, they end in excitatory synapses associated with
a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
(AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate, and metabotropic glutamate
receptors (4–8). Corticothalamic fibers strongly excite inhibitory
neurons of the RTN and these in turn inhibit relay neurons.
Relay neurons fire bursts of action potentials as they recover
from inhibition, re-exciting RTN cells so that the sequence
continues (9–11). The capacity of the disynaptic RTN-generated
inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) to overcome the monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) generated by
the direct corticothalamic input to the relay neurons is a key
element in generation of low-frequency oscillations or spindle
waves (10, 12), which are the electroencephalographic hallmarks
of drowsiness and early stages of slow-wave sleep. In models in
which the strength of corticothalamic input to RTN neurons is
set equal to that to relay neurons, the disynaptic IPSP is shunted
by the monosynaptic EPSP, and the network does not oscillate
(13). Here, we demonstrate that excitatory postsynaptic conductances (EPSCs) elicited by minimal stimulation of corticothalamic fibers are stronger quantitatively in RTN than in ventral
posterior thalamic nucleus (VP) neurons, and that the number
of GluR4 subunits at corticothalamic synapses on RTN neurons
is correspondingly greater than at synapses on relay cells,
providing a basis for synaptic heterogeneity.
Materials and Methods
Whole-cell recordings were made at 22–25°C from neurons in
layer VI of somatosensory cortex, RTN, and VP in brain slices
from postnatal day 13 to 24 ICR mice, cut at an angle that
preserves corticothalamic and thalamocortical connectivity, and
maintained in vitro as described (14). Electrode resistances were
2–5 MV. Biocytin 0.5% was present in the internal solution.
Holding potential was 270 mV. In paired recordings of layer VI
and thalamic neurons, 50–200 current pulses 10 msec in duration
and 500 pA to 1 nA in amplitude were injected into the cortical
cell to elicit single action potentials or pairs of action potentials
separated by 50 or 100 msec at 0.2 Hz.
Corticothalamic synaptic responses were evoked in VP and
RTN neurons by electrical stimulation of corticothalamic fibers
in layer VI or subcortical white matter using 0.1-msec cathodal
stimuli delivered at 0.2 or 0.5 Hz by a monopolar tungsten
electrode. Stimulus strength was set 10–15% above absolute
threshold to elicit a stable mixture of failures and successes.
EPSC amplitudes were measured as the difference between
the average of 0.5-msec regions spanning the baseline immediately before the onset of the EPSC and those straddling the peak
of the EPSC. Noise was determined by measuring the difference
of means of 0.5-msec regions spanning the baseline region and
a region separated by the same interval separating baseline and
EPSC-peak regions. All deflections less than 1.5zrms of noise
were considered failures. rms of noise was 2.33 6 0.91 pA in VP
neurons and 2.75 6 1.38 pA in RTN neurons and not statistically
different.
Slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate
buffer, incubated in avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex (ABC kit PK-4000, Vector Laboratories) and reacted with
3,39-diaminobenzidine-4HCl. Camera lucida drawings of filled
cells were made at 3100.
Twelve postnatal day 15 mice were anesthetized and perfused
with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1–0.15% glutaraldehyde in 0.1
M phosphate buffer. Sections containing VP and RTN were cut
on a Vibratome at 500 mm, cryoprotected in glycerol, frozen in
2180°C propane, infiltrated with 1.5% uranyl acetateymethanol
solution at 290°C, and embedded in Lowicryl HM-20 (Electron
Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA).
Serial 70- to 80-nm sections were mounted on Formvar-coated
nickel grids and immersed briefly in a saturated solution of
NaOH in absolute ethanol and incubated in 0.1% sodium
borohydride and 50 mM glycine in 5 mM Tris buffer containing
0.3–0.6% NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by 2% swine
albumin in the same solution before immunoreacting with rabbit
antisera to GluR2 and GluR3 (GluR2y3) or to GluR4 glutamate-receptor subunits (2 mgyml; Chemicon) for 4–12 h, followed by incubation in goat anti-rabbit Fab fragments coupled
to 10-nm gold particles (1:20; Biocell Laboratories) for 2 h at
room temperature. Grids were stained with uranyl acetate and
lead citrate and examined in a Philips (Eindhoven, the Netherlands) CM120 electron microscope.

The number of gold particles associated with the postsynaptic
density (PSD) was counted in 10 serially sectioned STs (corticothalamic synapses in RT) and 11 serially sectioned RSs
(corticothalamic synapses in VP) and in 436 ST and RS synaptic
profiles from 279 single sections from RTN and VP. PSDs with
no associated gold particles were included. Only gold particles
located within 20 nm of the inner leaflet of the postsynaptic
membrane and within 20 nm of the lateral edge of the postsynaptic membrane were counted.
Student’s t test was used for all tests of statistical significance.
Results are derived from recordings of 100 VP cells, 60 RTN
cells, and 60 layer VI cells. At the ages studied, corticothalamic
and intrathalamic circuitry is functionally mature (14). To isolate
responses of RTN neurons resulting from orthodromic activation of corticothalamic fibers from responses to antidromic
activation of thalamocortical collaterals, EPSCs were sorted
according to latency on the following grounds. (i) Corticothalamic fibers ending in the RTN of rodents (Fig. 1A) are thinner
than thalamocortical fibers and do not exhibit multiple diameters. Larger diameter corticothalamic fibers arising from layer V
cells do not collateralize in RTN (1, 2). (ii) The mean latency of
antidromic action potentials in VP neurons in response to
cortical stimuli was 2.25 6 0.35 msec, indicating that RTN EPSCs
with similarly short latencies arose from antidromic stimulation
of collaterals of these fibers. (iii) The latency distribution of
EPSCs in RTN cells showed two peaks at 2–3 and 6–7 msec (Fig.
1B). In recordings from RTN neurons, therefore, only EPSCs
with latencies greater than 6.0 msec were considered to result
from corticothalamic fiber stimulation. When RTN EPSCs with
latencies less than 6 msec were excluded, mean EPSC latency in
RTN neurons was not different statistically from mean EPSC
latency in VP neurons, indicating that EPSCs resulted from
stimulation of the same axons.
Minimal Corticothalamic EPSC Amplitudes Are Higher in RTN than in
VP Neurons. When all criteria to include only EPSCs resulting
from orthodromic stimulation of corticothalamic fibers were
met, and stimulus strength was adjusted to 10–15% above
threshold to elicit a stable ('50%) mixture of failures and
successes, mean failure rate in VP neurons was 61 6 13% (n 5
28) and in RTN neurons 44 6 24% (n 5 19). Peak amplitudes
of corticothalamic EPSCs fluctuated considerably (Fig. 2 A and
C). At 270 mV holding potential, mean peak amplitude of
corticothalamic EPSCs (excluding failures) was 8.96 6 3.30 pA
in VP neurons (n 5 28) and 21.65 6 5.58 pA (n 5 20) in RTN
neurons (Fig. 2B). These amplitudes correspond to conductance
changes of 128 6 47 pS for VP neurons and 309 6 80 pS for RTN
neurons. The differences were highly significant statistically (P ,
0.0001) and indicate that corticothalamic input to RTN neurons
is 2.42 times stronger than that to VP neurons (Fig. 2 Upper
Differences in amplitude of corticothalamic EPSCs in RTN
and VP neurons were not determined by differences in series,
and input resistance for these resistances were not significantly
different in RTN and VP neurons (data not shown). Rise and
decay times of the EPSCs also did not differ significantly (Fig.
2 Lower Inset). The mean 20–80% rise time was 0.612 6 0.14
msec (range 5 0.429–0.984 msec) in VP neurons (n 5 28) and
0.664 6 0.26 msec in RTN neurons (range 5 0.335–1.11 msec).
The decay time course of EPSCs could be best fit to a single
exponential function in VP and RTN neurons. The mean single
exponential decay time constant was 2.59 6 1.17 msec in VP
neurons (range 5 1.16–6.25 msec; n 5 27) and 2.73 6 1.52 msec
in RTN neurons (range 5 1.01–7.46 msec; n 5 19).

tials in the layer VI neuron elicited EPSPs in the VP neuron (Fig.
3). Only a small proportion of the action potentials in the layer
VI neuron elicited an EPSP in the VP neuron (Fig. 3C). Failure
rate was 68 6 7%. Mean peak amplitude of EPSPs when failures
were included was 85 6 8 mV. Mean peak amplitude when
failures were excluded was 254 6 30 mV. The latency of the
EPSPs was 8.67 6 2.02 msec, reflecting the slow conduction
velocity of the thin corticothalamic axons (Fig. 1B) and justifying
the 6-msec latency cutoff.
Unitary Corticothalamic EPSPs Elicited in VP Neurons Show Paired-
Pulse Facilitation. In paired recordings (n 5 3) in which single
action potentials in a layer VI neuron elicited EPSPs in a
synaptically coupled VP neuron, pairs of action potentials separated by 50 or 100 msec in the layer VI neuron elicited dramatic
paired-pulse facilitation in the VP neuron (Fig. 4A). The amplitude of the second EPSP was 340% greater than that of the
first EPSP at a 50-msec interspike interval and 224% greater at
a 100-msec interspike interval. The paired-pulse facilitation was
accompanied by a comparable decrease in the failure rate (Fig.
4B). The failure rate of the first EPSP was 333% greater than the
failure rate of the second EPSP at 50-msec interspike interval
and 185% greater at 100-msec interspike interval (data not
shown). These results suggest that paired-pulse facilitation results from an increase in probability of transmitter release
following the second action potential.
Differences in Quantal Size Underlie Differences in Minimal EPSC
Amplitudes in RTN and VP Neurons. EPSC amplitudes rarely displayed clear peaks from which quantal conductance could be
identified by conventional means. We therefore determined
quantal conductance by decreasing the probability of release to
a point at which, according to a Poisson model of transmitter
release, the large majority of responses would be due to release
of a single quantum. The Poisson model is applicable when
quanta are released independently, and the probability of release
at each release site is small, conditions that were met when we
reduced the [Ca21]y[Mg21] ratio (15). When [Ca21] was decreased from 2 to 1 mM and [Mg21] was increased from 1.3 to
3 mM, the failure rate of corticothalamic EPSCs increased from
61 6 13% to 82 6 6% in VP neurons and from 44 6 24% to 69 6
7% in RTN neurons, consistent with a decrease in release
probability. According to the Poisson model, the probability (P)
of observing a postsynaptic current made of x unit currents in
which there are N trials and N0 failures is:
Therefore, the probability of observing EPSCs made up of two
quanta in low-Ca21yhigh-Mg21 solutions was 1.6% in VP neurons and 4.7% in RTN neurons, suggesting that the large
majority of EPSC successes recorded under these conditions
were uniquantal events and dependent on release of a single
vesicle at a single release site.
The mean amplitude of corticothalamic EPSC successes permitted a reliable estimate of the quantal size at these synapses.
Mean amplitude was 7.24 6 1.78 pA in VP neurons (n 5 5) and
18.59 6 3.37 pA in RTN neurons (n 5 4) at 270 mV. These
values correspond to conductance changes of 103 6 25 pS in VP
neurons and 266 6 48 pS in RTN neurons. The difference was
highly significant statistically (P , 0.005; Fig. 2 Inset). Hence,
differences in quantal size of EPSCs may underlie differences in
minimal corticothalamic EPSCs in RTN and VP neurons. It
remains unknown, however, if there are differences in number of
release sites at the two synapses.

using established criteria (16). Although called ST synapses in
RTN and RS synapses in VP, they have identical characteristics:
small size (0.2–0.5 mm), spherical synaptic vesicles, few mitochondria, and asymmetrical membrane contacts. They are distinguished readily from terminals of thalamocortical collaterals
(in RTN; refs. 17 and 18) and lemniscal fibers (in VP; refs. 16 and
19). In VP and the somatosensory part of the RTN, the number
of similar terminals originating from brainstem fibers is extremely small, and they use transmitters other than glutamate
Immunogold particles that labeled GluR2y3 or GluR4 subunits were associated exclusively with asymmetrical synapses
including those made by corticothalamic terminals and were
localized predominantly at PSDs (Fig. 5). In serial thin-section
analysis, the mean number of GluR2y3 particles was 12.0 6 5.4
at RS synapses in VP and 12.0 6 3.5 at ST synapses in RTN,
indicating that corticothalamic synapses in RTN and VP have
approximately equal numbers of GluR2y3 receptor subunits
(Fig. 5G). The mean number of GluR4 particles was 9.3 6 3.5
at RS synapses in VP and 34.5 6 13.0 at ST synapses in RTN
(Figs. 5G and 6), indicating that there are 3.7 times as many
GluR4 subunits at corticothalamic synapses in RTN than in VP.
This difference was highly significant statistically (P , 0.0001;
Fig. 5G). Because the synaptic contacts are equal in size, density
of GluR4 receptor subunits differs in the same proportions.
In 436 single sections through PSDs in random thin sections,
the relative numbers of GluR4 or GluR2y3 particles per PSD
were the same proportionally as in the serial section analysis
(0.95:1 for GluR2y3 synapses in RTN and VP; 3.2:1 for GluR4
synapses in RTN and VP). The mean particle counts were used
to calculate the Poisson probabilities expected for GluR2y3 and
GluR4 synapses. These probabilities were quite similar, confirming that the number of immunoreactive particles observed was
based on random exposure of the epitopes to the immunoreagents (ref. 22; Fig. 6).
Discussion
The results demonstrate that the efficacy of corticothalamic
input to RTN neurons is greater than that to VP neurons. The
disynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potential in VP neurons resulting from corticothalamic excitation of RTN cells quickly
overwhelms the small direct corticothalamic EPSP in vitro (14),

PSD. (Bar 5 125 nM.) (G Upper) Mean number of GluR4 subunit-speciﬁc particles at serially sectioned corticothalamic synapses in RTN is much higher than at
synapses in VP (* P , 0.0001). Mean number of GluR2y3 particles is approximately equal. (G Lower) Tracings of the PSDs and associated immunogold particles

GluR4 particles are associated with all sections through the PSD of the RTN synapse, but some sections through the PSD of the VP synapse typically lack GluR4
particles. GluR2y3 particles have identical distributions in VP and RTN.
Counts of GluR4 and GluR2y3 particles at randomly sectioned PSDs
in RTN and VP. Overlying curves show theoretical Poisson-distributed data
with means corresponding to the observed means. Similarity in observed
and theoretical distributions implies that quantiﬁcation of receptorsubunit numbers was based on random exposure of epitopes to the
immunoreagents.

and in vivo electrical stimulation of the cortex primarily elicits
disynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in relay neurons
(13), although this can be due to antidromic invasion of thalamocortical axons, the collaterals of which can induce large EPSPs
in RTN neurons (23). When we excluded all EPSCs with
latencies less than 6 msec, presumed to result from activation of
thalamocortical fibers, latencies of EPSCs evoked by minimal
stimulation of cortex were not statistically different in RTN and
VP cells, in keeping with activation of RTN and VP neurons by
the same corticothalamic axons.
Rise times and decay-time constants of corticothalamic EP-
SCs in RTN and VP cells were relatively fast, suggesting that
EPSCs originated from electrotonically close synaptic terminals
on the dendrites. Although corticothalamic synapses are concentrated on distal dendrites of relay neurons (24, 25), the
neurons are electrically compact (26, 27) so corticothalamic
EPSCs are filtered minimally by dendritic electrotonic length.
The electrotonic structure of RTN neurons has not been defined,
but because EPSC kinetics were similar in VP and RTN neurons,
corticothalamic terminals on both cells are likely to be at similar
electrotonic distances from the soma.
Because peaks were unclear in histograms of corticothalamic
EPSC amplitudes and because deconvolution of peaks in amplitude distributions may be unreliable for determination of
quantal parameters (28, 29), we estimated quantal size by
lowering release probability to a point at which Poisson statistics
predicted that 90% of successes in VP neurons and 82% of
successes in RTN neurons would be uniquantal events. Quantal
conductance then was estimated by determining mean amplitude
of successes. This mean amplitude was 103 6 25 pS at corticothalamic synapses on VP neurons and 266 6 48 pS at synapses
on RTN neurons. The values are similar at excitatory synapses
on visual cortex interneurons (100 pS; ref. 30), at mossy fiber-
CA3 synapses (121–553 pS; ref. 31), and at excitatory synapses
on cerebellar granule cells (139 pS; ref. 32).
Because of voltage-clamp limitations, the actual conductance
change at the corticothalamic synapses may be greater than
estimated. Jonas et al. (31), who recorded EPSCs in mossy
fiber-CA3 synapses with rise and decay times similar to ours,
estimated that the EPSCs may have been attenuated to 0.32–0.87
of the ‘‘real’’ value. If the same degree of attenuation occurred
in our study, then the conductance change at corticothalamic
synapses may be as high as 118–322 pS in VP neurons and
306–831 pS in RTN neurons.
Dual whole-cell recordings from synaptically coupled pairs of
layer VI and VP neurons demonstrated that corticothalamic
transmission is unreliable: 68 6 7% of action potentials in layer
VI neurons failed to elicit an EPSP in VP neurons. The high
failure rate may arise from low probability of transmitter release.
Even if transmitter release occurs, it may not generate a detectable EPSP because some corticothalamic synapses, although
possessing functional N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, lack
AMPA receptors (8).
When failure rate of EPSPs is reduced during paired-pulse
facilitation, the corticothalamic synapse can adjust EPSP amplitude. Other studies have shown frequency-dependent facilitation at corticothalamic synapses in response to repetitive
stimulation (10, 33, 34). Changes in failure rate during facilitation at cortical and spinal cord synapses are thought to result
from increase in probability of release at synapses with initially
low release probabilities (35, 36). Changes in release probability
during short-term facilitation probably result from residual
calcium remaining in the terminal following the first action potential (37).
With immuno-electron microscopic procedures of the type
used, the number of immunogold particles bears a close
relationship to the number of receptor subunits present
(38, 39). There was no difference in the relative numbers of
GluR2y3 particles at corticothalamic synapses in VP and
RTN, but there were 3.7 times as many GluR4 particles at
corticothalamic synapses in RTN than in VP. This reflects
the higher expression of GluR4 mRNA and protein in the RTN
(40–44). GluR2y3 immunoreactivity probably is due to the
presence of GluR3 in both RTN and VP, because GluR2 along
with GluR1 is expressed negligibly in both nuclei. Therefore,
AMPA receptors at corticothalamic synapses in RTN and
VP are likely to be heteromers of GluR3 and GluR4 subunits. The larger number of GluR4 subunits undoubtedly
determines that quantal conductance at the RTN corticothalamic synapse is greater than at the VP synapse, because
single-channel conductance of recombinant GluR4 receptors
is substantially higher than that of receptors formed by homoor heteromeric combinations of other AMPA subunits (45).
The relative increase in GluR4-containing receptors should
provide the predicted greater strength of the corticothalamic
synapse in the RTN, helping to promote large scale synchrony
of thalamic and cortical neurons (46, 47).
At hippocampal mossy fiber synapses, it is hypothesized that
each immunogold particle corresponds to 2.3 AMPA receptors
(31, 38). Using this ratio, our findings suggest approximately 21
GluR4-containing AMPA receptors at VP corticothalamic synapses and approximately 79 at RTN corticothalamic synapses.
Jonas et al. (31), by using fast application of glutamate to somatic
patches of hippocampal granule cells in combination with noise
fluctuation analysis, estimated an 8.5 6 2.1 pS AMPA receptor
conductance, a maximal open probability of 0.71 6 0.06, and
receptor occupancy of 85%. If single-channel properties of
AMPA receptors at corticothalamic synapses on VP and RTN
neurons have similar characteristics, and if each immunogold
particle corresponds to 2.3 receptors, then the estimated quantal
conductances would be 110 pS at VP corticothalamic synapses
and 407 pS at RTN corticothalamic synapses, which are similar
to the measured conductances.
Corticothalamic synapses made by branches of the same axons
on RTN and VP cells acquire different weights by postsynaptic
mechanisms based on AMPA-receptor subunit composition.
The synaptic heterogeneity thus produced provides a basis for
the ability of the cortex to generate large-scale synchrony in the
thalamocortical network and for the preeminence of the cortex
in regulating the thalamus.
