By linking to external websites, Wikipedia can act as a gateway
to the Web. To date, however, little is known about the amount of
traffic generated by Wikipedia’s external links. We fill this gap in a
detailed analysis of usage logs gathered from Wikipedia users’ client
devices. Our analysis proceeds in three steps: First, we quantify the
level of engagement with external links, finding that, in one month,
English Wikipedia generated 43M clicks to external websites, in
roughly even parts via links in infoboxes, cited references, and
article bodies. Official links listed in infoboxes have by far the
highest click-through rate (CTR), 2.47% on average. In particular,
official links associated with articles about businesses, educational
institutions, and websites have the highest CTR, whereas official
links associated with articles about geographical content, television,
and music have the lowest CTR. Second, we investigate patterns of
engagement with external links, finding that Wikipedia frequently
serves as a stepping stone between search engines and third-party
websites, effectively fulfilling information needs that search engines
do not meet. Third, we quantify the hypothetical economic value
of the clicks received by external websites from English Wikipedia,
by estimating that the respective website owners would need to
pay a total of $7–13 million per month to obtain the same volume
of traffic via sponsored search. Overall, these findings shed light on
Wikipedia’s role not only as an important source of information,
but also as a high-traffic gateway to the broader Web ecosystem.

INTRODUCTION
Thanks to the collaborative effort of a community of volunteer editors, Wikipedia is the world’s largest encyclopedia and an important
source of information for millions of people. Wikipedia serves its
content as a regular website, allowing editors to add hyperlinks in
order to enable readers to more easily find additional content,
both internal and external. Internal links help readers locate relevant encyclopedic content by navigating from article to article.
In contrast, external links enrich articles with additional content

that should not or cannot be included in Wikipedia itself. There are
various reasons to add external links,1 with linked content ranging from official websites, to news articles used as references,2 to
copyrighted material.

Archive’s Wayback Machine.
In this paper, we are
interested in quantifying
and characterizing the outgoing traffic generated by
Wikipedia towards external content. Given Wikipedia’s crucial societal role
and global reach, it is essential to understand how it
interacts with the broader
Web by driving traffic to external websites. The resulting insights can inform the
platform’s future design
and thus allow it to better
cater to readers’ information needs around external
content. As Web traffic has
monetary value—in particular when the traffic goes
to commercial websites—
an investigation of the external traffic generated by Wikipedia also
sheds new light on the poorly understood role it has as a provider
not only of information, but also of economic wealth.
Research questions. We approach the question of Wikipedia’s
value as a gateway to the Web from two angles: informational and
economic. Concretely, we pose three research questions:
RQ1 Level of engagement with external links: What total
volume of traffic does Wikipedia drive to third-party websites? What is the click-through rate of external links, and
how does it vary across types of linked content? (Sec. 4)
RQ2 Patterns of engagement with external links: How
do users interact with external links? Do they click through
fast or slow, and how does this vary across types of linked
content? In what navigational situations do clicks to external
websites occur? (Sec. 5)
RQ3 Economic value of external links: What is the monetary value of the traffic from Wikipedia to external websites?
If website owners had to pay for an equivalent amount of
traffic via sponsored search, how much would this cost?

Summary of findings. Based on usage logs gathered over a onemonth period from English Wikipedia users’ client devices (Sec. 3),
we quantified the level of engagement with external links (RQ1),
determining that English Wikipedia generated 43 million clicks to
external websites during the month we studied, despite the fact
that, on average, the click-through rate (CTR) of external links was
only 0.08%. While most external links (95.5%) occurred in article
bodies and cited references (accounting for about two thirds of
the external traffic), a disproportionately large fraction (23%) of
the total traffic came from a relatively small fraction (0.8%) of all
external links, namely from official links to the website of the entity
covered in the respective article. Such official links are regularly
listed in so-called infoboxes, short tabular summaries of key facts
about the covered entity (see Fig. 1 for an example). Since official
links witnessed a vastly increased CTR of 2.47% (vs. 0.08% over
all external links), we focused our analysis on official links. In a
topical analysis, we found that official links associated with articles
about businesses, educational institutions, and websites had the
highest CTR (a first indicator of the economic value of Wikipedia’s
external links), whereas official links associated with articles about
geographical content, television, and music had the lowest CTR.
By analyzing patterns of engagement with external links (RQ2),
we observed that Wikipedia frequently serves as a stepping stone
between search engines and third-party websites. We captured this
effect quantitatively as well as in a manual analysis, where we found
that URLs that are down-ranked or censored by search engines, and
thus not retrievable via search, can often be found in Wikipedia
infoboxes, which leads search users to take a detour via Wikipedia.
We conclude that Wikipedia regularly and systematically meets
information needs that search engines do not meet, which further
confirms Wikipedia’s central role in the Web ecosystem.
Finally, we aimed to quantify the hypothetical economic value
of the clicks received by external websites from English Wikipedia
(RQ3). Wikipedia is, of course, free, and it runs thanks to the donations of thousands of people. We thus cannot ask how much money
Wikipedia could earn by charging a fee for external clicks—this
hypothetical scenario is simply too far from reality—but we may
approach the question from a different angle, asking how much
money external-website owners would have to pay in order to obtain an equivalent number of clicks by other means, such as paid
ads. In this spirit, we applied the Google Ads API to the content of
official websites linked from Wikipedia in order to generate keywords for sponsored search and estimated their cost per click at
market price. We conclude that the owners of external websites
linked from English Wikipedia’s infoboxes would need to collectively pay a total of around $7–13 million per month (or $84–156
million per year) for sponsored search in order to obtain the same
volume of traffic that they receive from Wikipedia for free.
These numbers exceed even the ballpark guess given in a bullish
2013 analysis that, unlike ours, was not based on real click logs,
but on generic rates commonly assumed in the online ad industry,
and estimated that Wikipedia could earn $2.5 million monthly via
affiliate links. Although our analysis of monetary value should
mostly be taken as an indicative “back-of-the-envelope” calculation,
it highlights the importance of Wikipedia not only as a source of
information, but also as a gratuitous provider of economic wealth.
RELATED WORK
User engagement on the Web. Being able to quantify user engagement is crucial for websites, especially for those with an advertising-based business model . Researchers from various fields
have investigated ways to measure users’ attention, interest, and
engagement with websites and their ads. Several works have tried
to predict engagement with content in social media based on social interest metrics, such as the number of post comments or
likes . Researchers in information retrieval have also investigated methods to estimate users’ satisfaction and engagement
with textual and visual Web search engines . In computational advertising, existing works have tried to improve ad serving
based on target engagement metrics , or to directly predict
ad click-through rates .
User engagement on Wikipedia. Users’ reasons for engaging
with Wikipedia are varied, and consequently bring about different
usage behaviors , ranging from in-depth information seeking
to using Wikipedia as a stopover towards other locations on the
Web . The most relevant prior work is a study by Piccardi
et al. , who used the same dataset as the present paper, but
focused exclusively on external links in cited references, whereas
the present study considers all external links, with a focus on official
links listed in infoboxes. Piccardi et al. found that users engage
little with the external links included in references, and that they do
so more frequently from short, possibly unsatisfactory Wikipedia
articles and in order to visit recent content, open access sources,
and references about life events (births, deaths, marriages, etc.). A
similar negative relationship between Wikipedia article quality and
user engagement with external sources via references was found
specifically for medical content .
Wikipedia’s own traffic is influenced by its connections to the
larger Web ecosystem, and its interdependence with search engines, and Google in particular, has real consequences. On the one
hand, Wikipedia’s content improves Google search results (e.g.,
via content snippets); on the other hand, this might keep users
from visiting Wikipedia itself . In the present paper, we take a
novel angle by focusing not on traffic from the rest of the Web to
Wikipedia, but on traffic from Wikipedia to the rest of the Web.
The economic value of Wikipedia. The value of Wikipedia to
the world is not only high, but also difficult, if not impossible, to
fully quantify in purely economic terms. It has been shown that
Wikipedia is essential—or has the potential to be—in a variety of
spillovers with substantial economic impact. For instance, it is of
critical importance to Web search engines, such as Google , and
has also been shown to be useful to improve, or even predict, financial markets . Wikipedia can be used to inform economic
development policies , improve the visibility of places, with
direct positive consequences on tourism , and even predict and
monitor global health and diseases . Furthermore, Wikipedia
has been shown to influence the very development of science .
Nevertheless, and perhaps surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge Wikipedia’s economic value as an information gateway to the
Web has rarely been discussed in previous work. In a rare exception,
researchers have considered the value of Wikipedia in providing
traffic to Reddit and Stack Overflow .

DATA AND DEFINITIONS
Wikipedia client-side logs
In order to analyze user engagement with Wikipedia’s external
links, we made use of the dataset collected by Piccardi et al. .
This dataset consists of logs of all reader interactions with external
links in English Wikipedia articles over the one-month period from
24 March to 21 April 2019. The data was captured by the browser
on the client side and includes all clicks on external links and a
uniformly random sample (33%) of all pageview events, organized
into sessions, i.e., sequences of events from the same user in the
same browser tab. This article reports results using the full dataset
when describing external-click events. Whenever pageview counts
are involved, we extrapolate from the 33% sample.
The data was collected in accordance with Wikimedia’s privacy
policy3 and processed exclusively on Wikimedia computing machinery. Although the data does not contain personally indentifiable
information beyond what is implicit in browsing behavior, it cannot
be shared publicly. For transparency, we publish our data analysis
code at 
Article characteristics
At the time of data collection, Wikipedia had around 5.8M articles,
which were loaded by readers more than 4.5 billion times during
the month studied. We characterized each article by popularity
(pageviews during the month studied) and length (number of characters). The popularity distribution was very skewed: 50% of the
articles had fewer than 42 views, 90% had fewer than 894 views.
In contrast, the average number of pageviews in one month was
700. The most visited 1,550 articles, which represented 0.02% of all
articles, accounted for 10% of all pageviews. The most visited pages
were articles about topics that were trending in April 2019, such as
nipsey hussle (5.7M views), notre-dame de paris (4.7M), bonnie
and clyde (3.5M), or game of thrones (season 8) (2.6M). Most
of the articles were short, and similar to popularity, the number of
characters showed a skewed distribution, with a median of 3,888,
and an average of 7,793 characters.
ORES topics. ORES4 is a toolkit offered by Wikimedia that, among
other things, includes functionality for labeling articles with topics,
based on a manually curated taxonomy of 64 topics derived
from WikiProjects.5 Based on this categorization, ORES offers a
3 
4 
5 
classifier that predicts, for a given article, its probability of belonging to each of the 64 topics. Since a single article may belong to
multiple topics, the 64 probabilities generally do not sum to 1. We
used topic labels in binarized form, considering an article to belong
to a topic if the corresponding probability is greater than 50%. Note
that, although the taxonomy is hierarchically organized in two levels, in this work we only considered the 57 lower-level topics (listed
along the x-axis of Fig. 3). Having run the classifier on all articles in
the dataset, we observed that overall the most common topic was
biography (1.7M articles), followed by sports (1.4M) and north
america (950K). The least common topics were eastern africa
(11K) and libraries & information (14K).
External links
External links form our central object of study, so we extracted
detailed information about them from Wikipedia articles. Since
parsing content from articles in wikitext format might result in
missing hyperlinks , we extracted the external links from the
articles in HTML format instead. As this paper focuses specifically
on those Wikipedia links that lead to external websites, we adopt
the convention that, whenever we simply say “link”, we implicitly
mean “external link”.
We partitioned the external links in the dataset into three classes,
according to their position on the page: infobox, article body, and
references. Infoboxes are tables (typically rendered by the browser
on the right-hand side of the page on desktop devices, or at the top
of the page on mobile devices) that summarize key information by
adding semi-structured content (see Fig. 1). In addition to images
and textual properties, this area can contain—potentially many—
external links pointing to external geolocation services, official
registries, or official websites. The links in an article body appear
inline within the main textual content of the page or in dedicated
sections such as “External links” or “See also”. Links in article
bodies are more heterogeneous, including links to social media
pages, PDF documents, or related external material. Finally, we
considered as references all links used to cite external content in
support of a statement. Typically they appear at the bottom of the
page, reachable from the article body via numbered link anchors.
During the period considered, Wikipedia had 5.3M articles that
contained at least one of 63.1M external links (totaling 49.8M unique
target URLs). Table 1 (column “Total links”) summarizes these values. In total, 35.3M (56.0%) of these links appeared in references,
24.9M (39.5%) in article bodies, and 2.8M (4.5%) in infoboxes. Around
1.3M articles in English Wikipedia had an infobox with links, and
the average number of links per infobox in these articles was 2.08.

Tiziano Piccardi, Miriam Redi, Giovanni Colavizza, and Robert West
Links spanned from official company links (e.g., schlenkerla.de) to
geocoordinates on geohack.toolforge.org to institutional registries
(e.g., National Register of Historic Places).
Official links
To further qualify the infobox links, we designed a binary classifier
that can distinguish between official links and other types of link.
It was trained on a random sample of 2,000 infobox links, manually
annotated as “official” or “other”. This resulted in a training set of
387 official links and 1,613 other links. To characterize each link,
we then computed the following features:
• URL length: Number of characters in the URL path (guided
by the intuition that official-link URLs tend to be short).
• Similarity of URL with article title: Motivated by the
usefulness of character n-grams for URL-based topic classification , we computed the character n-grams (n = 1, . . . , 4)
of the title of the article where the link was placed, the link’s
anchor text (if non-empty), the domain of the link URL, and
the path of the link URL. We then computed, and used as features, the Jaccard similarity of sets of n-grams for three pairs:
title/URL-domain, anchor-text/URL-domain, title/URL-path.
• Similarity of context with marker words: Jaccard similarities between the character n-gram sets (n = 1, . . . , 4) of
high-precision marker words (“official”, “website”, “homepage”, “URL”) and of the link’s anchor text and context (i.e.,
the text within the same <TR> tag as the link).
We used these 10 features and the manual labels in a random
forest classifier, achieving 5-fold cross-validated precision 0.980 (SD
0.009), recall 0.983 (SD 0.005), and F1 score 0.982 (SD 0.007).
Applying this classifier to all the links in the dataset, we found
that 506K of the 63.1M external links corresponded to the official
website of the entity described in the respective article. Broken
down by article topic, the largest number of official links was associated with north america (27.2%), europe (25.0%), media (20.2%),
biography (18.9%), asia (17.1%), education (10.5%), and business
and economics (9.5%), with the latter containing mainly articles
about companies. (The percentages sum to more than 100% because
articles may belong to multiple topics.)
As expected, according to the classifier, the vast majority (98.1%)
of articles with an official link had exactly one official link, and
conversely, the vast majority (97.1%) of official links appeared as
such in exactly one article’s infobox. This has the added advantage
that official links can be characterized by features derived from
their corresponding Wikipedia articles (e.g., topics, content words).
Definitions
Definition: click-through rate (CTR). Our main metric for measuring engagement with external links is the click-through rate
(CTR), which, intuitively, is simply the number of times a link was
clicked, divided by the number of times the link was displayed (by
virtue of being contained in an article that contained the link). In
practice, care must be taken, as it frequently happens that the same
article is viewed multiple times in the same session, e.g., because the
user refreshes the page or clicks the back button. To guard against
overcounting such multiple views, we grouped all pageviews of the

same article a that occurred during the same session s and call the
unique pair (a,s) one visit of a.
With Nl as the number of visits (i.e., distinct (a,s) pairs) upon
which link l was displayed, and Cl as the number of visits upon
which link l was clicked, we define the CTR of link l as Cl/Nl, i.e.,
the fraction of visits upon which l was clicked, out of all visits upon
whichl was displayed. Since each official link belongs to exactly one
article (with extremely rare exceptions; cf. Sec. 3.4), we may also,
in a slight abuse of terminology, speak of the “CTR of an article”,
implying the CTR of the official link associated with the article.
In order to reliably estimate CTRs, we need to avoid small denominators, so we restricted our analyses to links that were displayed
upon at least 300 pageview events. In the case of official links, this
resulted in a set of 160K links (and their corresponding articles).
Definition: click time. In order to capture how long users dwell
on an article before they click an external link, we define the notion
of click time, which measures the number of seconds between the
pageview event on which the link was displayed and the click on
the link itself. If the same external link was clicked multiple times
in the same session, we only considered the first pageview that was
accompanied by an external click.
Since click times are unbounded above and follow a heavy-tailed
distribution, we used medians, rather than means, for aggregation.
RQ1: LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT WITH
EXTERNAL LINKS
We start our analysis by quantifying the level of engagement with
external links, both overall (Sec. 4.1) and by article topic (Sec. 4.2).
Overall click statistics
Overall click statistics are summarized in Table 1. During our onemonth data collection period, there was a total of around 4.5 billion
Wikipedia pageviews, which led to around 43.1M clicks on external
links. The total volume of external clicks was distributed roughly
evenly over the three classes of external links: those in infoboxes
(12.5M), those in references (14.2M), and those in article bodies
(16.2M). As the vast majority of external links was located in references (56.0%) and article bodies (39.5%), the CTR of infobox links
(0.90%) vastly exceeded that of links in references (0.03%) and article bodies (0.14%). To ascertain that this was not simply caused by
the fact that infobox links appear higher up on the page, we also

computed the CTR of article-body links appearing in the top 20%
of the page. This yielded a CTR of 0.20%, much closer to the 0.14%
of article-body links overall than to the 0.90% of infobox links.
Official links. Official links play a key role. Although they constituted only 18% of the 2.8M infobox links, they accounted for 78%
of the 12.5M clicks on infobox links, with a CTR of 2.47%, nearly
3 times as high as that of infobox links overall. The average CTR
was even higher on desktop devices, where it reached 2.78%, vs.
1.87% on mobile (Fig. 2a). Given their prominence, we shall focus
mostly on official links from here on, and unless stated otherwise,
we henceforth refer to official links when simply writing “links”.
Geographical differences. The top 5 countries by pageview volume were, in this order, the United States, the United Kingdom,
India, Canada, and Australia. They generated 71.6% of the total traffic. Among these countries, the CTR on official links was highest in
the U.S. (2.36%), followed by India (2.14%), the U.K. (1.53%), Canada
(1.38%), and Australia (1.11%).
Click-through rates by topic
Next, we aim to understand how the click-through rates of official
links vary by topic as defined by the ORES classifier introduced
in Sec. 3.2. Since, in the vast majority of cases, official links are
associated with exactly one article, we may label each official link
with the topics of that article. (Throughout the discussion that
follows, keep in mind that each article, and thus each official link,
may be labeled with multiple topics.)
Fig. 3 visualizes the mean CTR (in blue), as well as the number of
articles with official links (in gray), by topic. We see that official links
relating to libraries & information, software, and internet
culture had the highest click-through rates, whereas geographical
content, media-related content, and biographies on average saw
the lowest engagement.

clicked more rarely and more slowly; those on more popular pages are clicked more rarely and more quickly.
Controlling for article length and popularity. The length and
popularity of a Wikipedia article correlated strongly and negatively
with the CTR of the official link contained in its infobox (Fig. 4a),
possibly because longer articles, by offering more information, reduce the user’s need to gather additional information from external
links, and because more popular articles are more likely to appear
in shallower information-seeking sessions . Since length and
popularity also vary by topic, they might act as confounds that
could potentially explain an observed variation of CTR by topic.
WWW ’21, April 19–23, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia
Tiziano Piccardi, Miriam Redi, Giovanni Colavizza, and Robert West
To tease these two confounds apart from the impact of topics
alone, we controlled for length and popularity in a matched analysis,
as follows. We split the set of articles at the median CTR into highvs. low-CTR articles, and we split the length and popularity ranges
into 1,000 equally sized bins each. We then defined a bipartite graph
with edges between articles that fell in different CTR halves, but
in the same bins with respect to length and popularity. Using the
Euclidean distance in the space defined by the logarithmic length
and popularity as edge weights, we found a minimum matching
and retained only the 112K matched articles (out of originally 160K).
This procedure successfully balanced the dataset.6
In the balanced dataset, we binarized the CTR by splitting at the
median and fit a logistic regression to model whether an article
belonged to the high- or low-CTR group, with topic indicators
as predictors (pseudo R2 = 0.20, p < 10−307). (The advantage of
performing regression modeling rather than a simple comparison
of per-topic average CTRs is that topics are correlated, which is
accounted for by the regression model.)
The 15 largest positive and negative coefficients, plotted in Fig. 5a,
revealed a slightly different ranking than Fig. 3, with business and
economics and education emerging as the strongest predictors
of a high CTR, whereas geographical and television remained
the strongest predictors of a low CTR.
Top of the CTR ranking. While manually screening the data, we
realized that, among the articles with the highest official-link CTR,
there was a disproportionate fraction of articles about websites
(which are generally classified by ORES under the topic internet
culture), and in particular websites related to file sharing and
pornography, some with CTRs of 40% or more, e.g., Library Genesis
(47%), RARBG (45%), or The Pirate Bay (43%). To determine whether
official links of Wikipedia articles about websites dominated the top
of the CTR ranking in general, we repeated the above regression
analysis with a small modification: instead of predicting the top half
vs. the bottom half of the article ranking with respect to CTR, we
now predicted the top L articles (an absolute, rather than relative
number) vs. the same number of samples from the bottom half,
matched on length and popularity. This way, plotting the fitted
coefficients for a given topic as a function of L reveals whether
the topic is particularly over-represented among the highest-CTR
official links (manifested in a sharply decreasing curve). The results,
presented in Fig. 6, clearly show that internet culture—a topic
held by most articles about websites—is indeed particularly overrepresented among the articles with the very highest official-link
CTR. Similar effects were observed for society (a loose mix of
articles), sports, software, and entertainment, among others.
On the contrary, we observed that geographical, biography, and
television, among others, were particularly under-represented
among the highest-CTR official links.
Fine-grained topical analysis. The topics from the ORES classifier used above are rather broad. In order to obtain more finegrained insights, we conducted a word- rather than topic-level
analysis, where we represented an official link by the words contained in the lead paragraph of the article in whose infobox the link

appeared as an official link (via z-score-standardized TF-IDF vectors
restricted to the 3,000 most frequent words across all articles with
official links). Mirroring the above regression analysis, but now
using words rather than topics as predictors (pseudo R2 = 0.31,
p < 10−307), this analysis revealed words associated with high- vs.
low-CTR links. Fig. 5b, which shows the 15 words with the largest
positive and negative coefficients, confirms our previous findings
while adding nuance. We see that education specifically marks
high-CTR links about universities, schools, institutes, and museums; business and economics, about companies, manufacturers,
chains, and airlines; and internet culture, about adult websites.
Summary. Taking stock of the findings so far, we reiterate that
official links play a key role among Wikipedia’s external links, with
CTRs far above those of other types of external link. We observed a
large amount of variation depending on article topics, with official
links associated with articles about websites, software, businesses,
education, and sports seeing particularly high engagement.

Top L links w.r.t. CTR
Figure 6: Prevalence of topics among most frequently clicked official links. We fitted binary logistic regression models that
used article topics as predictors to predict if an article’s official link is among the top L highest-CTR links. Plots show regression coefficients for individual topics (predictors) as functions of L (for values of L between 1K and 15K). Topics are sorted by
the leftmost values of their curves. Sharply decreasing [increasing] curves correspond to topics that are particularly over-represented [under-represented] among the links with the most extreme CTR. (More details: Sec. 4.2, “Top of the CTR ranking”.)
RQ2: PATTERNS OF ENGAGEMENT WITH
EXTERNAL LINKS
Above, we established which types of external link have a particularly high CTR. Next, we investigate more closely the patterns by
which users engage with external links.
Click time
We start by analyzing the click time (cf. Sec. 3.5), which captures
how long users dwell on an article before leaving it toward an
external website via an external link.
Click time statistics are summarized in Table 1, and click time
distributions are plotted in Fig. 2b, for the three types of link: those
appearing in infoboxes, article bodies, and references, respectively.
(Note that, although we consider only official links in most of this
paper—and indeed in the rest of this section—we nevertheless report
this basic statistic for all types of external link beyond official links
only.) The global median click time was 32.9 seconds (31.8 seconds
for desktop, 34.4 seconds for mobile), with a much lower value
for infobox links (18.7 seconds; 20.1 seconds for official links), and
larger values for the article-body links (35.4 seconds) and reference
links (51.8 seconds). The short click time of infobox links, however,
seems to be due to their prominent position within articles: when
approximately controlling for position by considering only articlebody links in the top 20% of the page, the median click time dropped
to 22.2 seconds, only 10% longer than for infobox links.
After this general characterization, we from here on focus on
official links in infoboxes. Similar to CTR (Fig. 4a), the click time
of official links was correlated with article length and popularity
(Fig. 4b), such that clicks took more time on longer and on less
popular articles. When analyzing click time by topic, we thus again
controlled for these two factors via matching, as they could otherwise confound the analysis. Analogously to the setup of Sec. 4.2,
we split the set of articles at the median click time into articles with
“slow” vs. “fast” clicks on official links, and subsequently found a
bipartite matching in order to ensure that the distribution of length
and popularity was nearly identical in articles with “slow” vs. “fast”
official-link clicks.7 We then fitted a linear regression on the resulting balanced dataset in order to model the logarithmic click time
as the outcome variable, using (as in Sec. 4.2) topic indicators as
predictors (R2 = 0.090, p < 10−307).
The 15 largest positive and negative coefficients are plotted in
Fig. 7a, revealing that clicks on official links to entertainment-related websites occurred faster, whereas links to websites on more
classic encyclopedic topics, such as biographies, geographical content, history, etc., occurred more slowly.
To gain more granular insights than at the coarse topic level, we
again ran an analysis at the word level, parallel to the word-level
analysis of Sec. 4.2, but this time in the linear regression setup just
described (R2 = 0.17, p < 10−307). The words most indicative of
slow and fast clicks (Fig. 7b) mirror the findings from the topic-level
analysis (Fig. 7a), but we now also see that official links on articles
about websites and universities were clicked particularly fast.
Wikipedia as a stepping stone
We just noted that official links on articles about websites typically
have short click times. Moreover, in Sec. 4.2 we had observed that
such links are also strongly over-represented among the highest-
CTR links. This observations led us to hypothesize that the main
interest of users interacting with these links might be to find these
links to begin with, rather than to find the content that surrounds
the links in their respective Wikipedia articles. In other words, we
hypothesized that Wikipedia serves as a “stepping stone” toward
external websites, whereupon users barely set foot onto Wikipedia
before leaving again towards different content that they actually
were intent on finding. To further investigate this hypothesis, we
considered the relationship between CTR and click time, visualized in Fig. 8, which presents a scatter plot of the coefficients obtained from the previously described regressions for CTR Topic-based analysis

cf. Sec. 4.2) and click time (y-axis; cf. Sec. 5.1). As the plot shows,
topics with a high CTR tended to have low click times (lower right
quadrant), notably sports, radio, and internet culture (a topic
that, as mentioned, primarily tags articles about websites). We take
this as another indicator of the existence of a class of articles from
which users leave Wikipedia frequently and fast.
If indeed a distinct class of articles on Wikipedia are used heavily
as stepping stones, then we should be able to identify many articles
that were visited primarily from outside of Wikipedia (e.g., from
search engines), rather than from other Wikipedia articles (via
internal navigation), and that had a high CTR on the external links
they contain. With the goal of finding such articles, we define the
external-referrer frequency (ERF) of an article as the fraction of all
visits made to the article via a click from a referral page external to
Wikipedia. Note that external referrals almost exclusively stemmed
from search engines: about 70% of them specified a search engine
referrer URL in the logs, and about 29% did not specify any referrer
URL, but it is suspected that a majority of these visits also come from

search . Hence, we included empty referrers in our analysis,
although the conclusions were identical when excluding them.
The ERF histogram, plotted in Fig. 9a, shows that most articles
were primarily visited from outside of Wikipedia, but only few
articles had a very high ERF close to 1. Although extreme-ERF
articles were in total visited less than medium-ERF articles (Fig. 9b),
they generated a total number of external clicks comparable to that
generated by medium-ERF articles (Fig. 9c). The most important
piece of evidence, however, comes from Fig. 9d, which plots, on the
y-axis, the mean CTR for situations where the respective article was
reached from an external referrer. The plot shows that the articles
that were nearly exclusively reached from external referrers (with
an ERF close to 1) are precisely those articles that also had the
highest CTR after being reached from an external referrer.8
Taken together, these facts provide evidence of a class of articles
that serve as mere “stepping stones”, “revolving doors”, or “in-andouts”: users come from elsewhere in order to find a particular link
and immediately leave Wikipedia by clicking that link.
But why, then, would users go through Wikipedia in the first
place, if all they want is to go to a website linked from Wikipedia?
We shall discuss potential reasons for this behavior in Sec. 7.
RQ3: ECONOMIC VALUE OF EXTERNAL
Our final set of analyses aims to estimate the monetary value of
the traffic that Wikipedia drives to external websites.
The idea behind our calculations is the following. Search engines
generally charge website owners money in exchange for driving
clicks to their sites from sponsored search results (e.g., Google Ads),
whereas Wikipedia conveys a large volume of traffic to official
websites for free. We therefore ask, “How much money would a
search engine want from website owners to obtain, via ads, the
same number of clicks they obtain from Wikipedia for free?”
While we could be asking, “How much money could Wikipedia earn by charging a fee for external clicks?”, we consider this
counterfactual scenario too far from reality: Wikipedia is open and
free by design, and it functions rather differently from platforms
8 This analysis only considered articles with at least 100 visits from external referrers,
in order to avoid noise due to division by small numbers.

driven mostly by advertising. Moreover, we could not estimate
the “price paid” to Wikipedia in this scenario, as we do not know
whether website owners would be willing or able to actually pay for
any hypothetical click fees. On the contrary, estimating the “price
asked”—the cost of online ads—is entirely feasible.
Methodology
Google Ads. To estimate the price of achieving a certain set of URL
clicks via online ads, we used the Google Ads API, with “sponsored
search” as the ads network. Google Ads is one of the most prolific advertising platforms, and the primary source of revenue for
Google’s parent company, Alphabet . The Google Ads API allows
advertisers to create campaigns for promoting a URL by placing
bids on campaign-related search keywords. The bid expresses the
maximum amount that the website owner is willing to pay each
time the promoted URL is clicked when shown on the search result page for the respective keyword. When a user searches for a
keyword specified by the campaign, an auction system determines
which sponsored URL to show among all the candidates competing
for the keyword.9 When the user clicks a promoted link, the campaign owner pays the auction value. Note that the paid price is not
necessarily equal to, but only bounded by, the website owner’s bid.
From URLs to keywords. Our intended analysis started from
clicks on official links (URLs) observed in the Wikipedia logs and
aimed to estimate how much these clicks would cost when obtained
via Google Ads instead of Wikipedia. The Google Ads API, on the
contrary, requires keywords, not URLs, as input. Thus, in order
to leverage Google Ads for our analysis, we had to work our way
backwards and determine appropriate keywords that a website
owner might use to advertise a given URL. Since the choice of the
right keywords is critical to increase a website’s discoverability
while keeping ad costs down , Google Ads offers a tool called
Keyword Planner, which, given a website URL, generates a set of
relevant keywords, alongside information on the historical bidding
range and search volume for those keywords. Using the Keyword
Planner, we generated 11 keywords for each official link: the title
9 With the “broad search” option, the number of matching searches increases by also
considering substrings and permutations of the tokens in campaign keywords.

the most relevant keywords generated for two different websites:

Cost-per-click (CPC) forecasting. Once the set of keywords and
the bids have been set, Google Ads can make a prediction about the
cost of the campaign through its forecasting tool. The prediction
model uses historical data to simulate the auction system and provides an estimated number of clicks and the average price for every
keyword. The tool predicts the campaign’s average cost per click
(CPC) by combining the keyword costs with their expected clickthrough rates. In practice, the forecasting tool simulates campaigns
for specific target countries. We used the top 5 English-speaking
countries (U.S., U.K., India, Canada, and Australia; cf. Sec. 4.1) as
target countries, since they accounted for a large portion (71.6%) of
all external-link clicks in the Wikipedia logs studied here.
Estimating the value of official links. Leveraging the above
tools, we estimated how much a website owner would need to pay
to Google Ads for a single click to their website as follows:
(1) Obtain keywords for the website via the Keyword Planner.
(2) For each keyword, set the bid to the 80th percentile of the
keyword’s historical auction price.
(3) Estimate the cost (CPC) for one click on the website link by
feeding the keywords and their bids to the forecasting tool
(using “broad search”, cf. footnote 9).

Figure 10: Distribution of official-link CPC, estimated via
Google Ads API. Vertical lines represent weighted versions
of median and mean, respectively, where each link was
weighted according to its click volume in Wikipedia logs.
We emphasize that setting a high bid (step 2) does not automatically entail a high CPC. Indeed, as we shall see, the winning price
was usually much lower than the bid. A high bid ensures that we
are likely to win the simulated auction and that the promoted link
is actually displayed to the user, which is required in order to obtain
clicks—the event whose cost we are aiming to estimate.
Cost per click (CPC). We applied the above-described procedure
to a total of 3,600 official links from Wikipedia infoboxes, obtained
by randomly sampling an equal number of articles from each of the
57 topics. During the one-month study period, these 3,600 official
links were clicked 2.73M times in total.
As mentioned, the bid passed to the forecasting tool is not necessarily the winning price of the simulated auction; it merely caps
expenses. In practice, the auction price reached our bid in only 8.9%
of cases; on average, the auction price was 58% of the bid.
The CPC distribution is shown in Fig. 10. When weighting all
links evenly (i.e., macro-averaging), the mean and median CPC is
$1.64 and $0.90, respectively. As not all links are equally popular, a
more reasonable estimate of the overall CPC may be obtained by
weighting each link according to the number of clicks it received
(i.e., micro-averaging). The resulting weighted CPC is slightly lower,
with a mean and median of $1.37 and $0.73, respectively (vertical
lines in Fig. 10).
Investigating the weighted mean CPC for individual topics, we
found considerable variation, with the highest CPCs for mathematics, medicine & health, books, and architecture, and the lowest
CPCs for music, sports, fashion, and films (omitting from the list
topics that mark geographical regions, such as north america).
Monthly value of traffic to official websites. Multiplying the
weighted CPC with the overall number of 9.8M clicks on official
links during the one-month study period, we estimate the total
monthly value generated by the traffic from Wikipedia to official
websites as $13.4 million when using the mean CPC estimate, or
as $7.2 million when using the median CPC estimate.
Broken down by topic, we obtained the (mean-based) estimates
of Fig. 11. The topic with the highest total monthly value ($1.9M) is
north america, a macro category assigned to a large set of articles,
including U.S. companies and people. It is followed by business
and economics ($1.3M), biography ($1.3M), technology ($1.0M),
and software ($0.9M).
DISCUSSION
Wikipedia as a gateway to the Web. While the value of Wikipedia’s knowledge is fairly well known, less known was the hidden
and significant additional value of Wikipedia as a gateway. Building on top of existing work related to Wikipedia readers’ behavior
analysis, we have uncovered a new perspective on the role of Wikipedia in the broader Web ecosystem. We offered a description of the
value of Wikipedia as a gateway under multiple levels of analysis.
Overall, we found that a substantial fraction of Wikipedia readers
use the encyclopedia as a gateway to the broader Web: readers
engage more and faster with official links in the article’s infobox
than with links in the article body or in the reference section. We
found that Wikipedia’s role as a gateway to external content is
particularly pronounced when users visit articles about websites,
software, businesses, education, and sports, among others, where
the click-through rate of official links is the highest.
Wikipedia as a stepping stone. We found an inverse relation
between the time it takes to click on an external link and its average click-through rate, showing clusters of topics, such as sports
and internet culture where engagement with links was high
and fast, or conversely, where engagement with link was low and
slow, such as biography and geographical. We also observed
that articles that were visited particularly frequently from external referrers (mostly search engines) also had a particularly high
probability of an official-link click after being reached from external referrers. These results indicate that a certain distinct set of
Wikipedia articles is leveraged by users in the spirit of “stepping
stones” or “revolving doors”, which are reached nearly exclusively
from external referrers (mostly search) and from which the user
leaves Wikipedia immediately again by clicking an official external
website link. This begs the question: If users visit Wikipedia from a
search engine result page only to leave it immediately towards a
third website, why would they not simply use the search engine to
locate the third website to begin with?
We conjecture that the reason is that the search engine cannot
fulfill the user’s information need in such situations, whereas Wikipedia can. When manually screening the data (focusing on popular
articles with at least 30K pageviews during the one-month study
period), we found that, among the articles with the highest CTR,
there was a disproportionate fraction of file-sharing (5 of the top 6)
and pornographic (5 of the top 15) websites. Such search results are
frequently censored or down-ranked by search engines, depending
on the search engine’s corporate policy as well as legislation in the
user’s country. Indeed, manually searching Google for the names of
the 15 articles with the highest CTR (and more than 30K monthly
pageviews) from two locations (U.S. and Germany) revealed that 5
file-sharing websites and 1 pornographic website were not listed by
Google among the top 10 search results in at least one of the two

locations. (Additionally, two controversial websites were not online
anymore at the time of research, about 18 months after data collection.) While these findings remain small-scale and anecdotal, they
suggest that Wikipedia fills a functional gap, as a workaround for
content suppressed by search engines (sometimes for valid reasons,
e.g., when the linked material is copyrighted or illegal).
Wikipedia’s role as a transitory stepping stone towards external
content can have important implications for Web user studies. For
example, researchers working on disinformation diffusion might
want to take into account the function of Wikipedia as a short yet
crucial stopover in Web users’ information-seeking journeys.
The economic value of traffic generated by Wikipedia. Finally, we set out to estimate the monetary value of Wikipedia as a
gateway to the broader Web. The infoboxes contained in English
Wikipedia articles collectively list over half a million official-website links, which were clicked 9.8M times during our one-month
study period. These clicks were generated by Wikipedia for free,
amidst a Web ecosystem that is majorly powered by paid ads. We
asked, “If the respective website owners wanted to achieve the
same number of clicks via sponsored search results, what would
be the price?” We estimate that achieving the 9.8M monthly clicks
on official links would cost a total of $7–13 million using Google
Ads. Extrapolating to 12 months, the yearly cost would amount to
$84–156 million. This is a remarkably high number, considering
that the annual revenue of the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-forprofit organization that operates Wikipedia and its sister projects,
stands at around $110 million,10 coming entirely from donations
and voluntary contributions. We also emphasize that the estimated
economic value of $84–156 million pertains to English Wikipedia
only, whereas Wikimedia’s annual revenue of $110 million needs
to support all Wikimedia projects across languages.
We showed that, when buying clicks from Google Ads instead
of obtaining them from Wikipedia for free, the types of businesses
that would have to pay the most would be North American companies, as well as software and technology businesses. While the
10 
narrative about tech companies’ donations to Wikipedia has often
been around their massive usage of the free encyclopedic content
for products and algorithms , these findings might provide
yet another perspective on how these companies benefit from the
hard work of hundreds of thousands of volunteer editors.
More broadly, our work expands the small body of literature
on measuring the value of Wikipedia to the Web . While
previous work focused on the value of content production, for example estimating that Wikipedia generates $1.7 million of Reddit
and Stack Overflow’s revenue, based on the amount of Wikipedialinked posts on those platforms , we focused here on the value
of Wikipedia traffic. We provided, for the first time, an estimation of
the monetary value offered—for free—by Wikipedia to the broader
Web ecosystem by means of link navigation.
Limitations and future work. This study should be considered
in the light of its limitations. Most notably, it was constrained
to data collected during one month from English Wikipedia only,
and as such provides a limited view of readers’ general behavior.
Future work should replicate the study for different time periods and
language versions in order to paint a more complete and inclusive
picture of Wikipedia readers’ engagement with external links.
Besides broadening the scope, future work should also go deeper
by more closely investigating why certain types of official link see
particularly high or low CTRs (e.g., the CTR of links to geographical
and biographical content was particularly low; cf. Fig. 5a). Also,
considering that official links related to business and economics saw the highest CTRs, it will be interesting to analyze which
businesses benefit most from the free traffic provided by Wikipedia.
Whereas our investigation of the volume (RQ1) and patterns
(RQ2) of engagement with external links on Wikipedia was primarily measurement-based, our estimation of the economic value
of Wikipedia as a gateway to the Web (RQ3) was more speculative. On the one hand, we operated under the assumption that
our methodology for obtaining costs per click via the Google Ads
API is sound and provides accurate estimates, despite the fact that
we relied on keyword suggestions of unknown quality from the
Google Ads Keyword Planner and on uncertain auction simulations

Tiziano Piccardi, Miriam Redi, Giovanni Colavizza, and Robert West
from the Google Ads forecasting tool. On the other hand, and more
fundamentally, estimating the economic value of the Web traffic
generated by Wikipedia necessarily requires arguing about a hypothetical, counterfactual (“what if”) situation, in our case, “What
if website owners were to pay for the same number of clicks via
Google Ads instead of obtaining them from Wikipedia for free?”
Although similar reasoning has been applied to estimate the
value of images from Wikimedia Commons , it remains open
how realistic that “what if” is: as a matter of fact, Wikipedia is
providing those clicks for free, so why would website owners ever
decide to pay for them instead? As one concrete example, one
could imagine a situation where a website owner would want to
increase traffic to their site, in which case our estimates indicate how
much it would cost them to double the traffic they already receive
from Wikipedia for free. Alternatively, one could imagine scenarios
where Wikipedia were to be blocked by censorship or ceded to
exist entirely, in which case our estimated economic value of traffic
from Wikipedia would correspond to the loss on behalf of website
owners due to the lack of that traffic. Finally, and more boldly, one
could imagine a setting where Wikipedia decided to introduce a
fee for clicks on official website links, in which case our estimate
would upper-bound the amount of extra revenue Wikipedia could
possibly earn from such a fee. Although the latter setting is highly
unrealistic, we consider it a useful thought experiment that can
help emphasize Wikipedia’s importance as a provider of free traffic.
As a final remark, we argue that all notions of economic value
are fundamentally counterfactual at heart, as they always consider
“what if” scenarios (“If A were to give X to B, how much money
would B give to A in return?”), which is also the reason why business
valuations of companies are routinely criticized as absurdly off .
To conclude, we hope this work will offer ideas and methods to
those interested in exploring Wikipedia’s role in the larger Web
ecosystem in more depth, and that it will help quantify the true
value of the largest encyclopedic knowledge repository on the Web.
