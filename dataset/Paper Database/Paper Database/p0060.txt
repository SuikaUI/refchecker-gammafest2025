Laplacian. For x G Mn, let us denote p(x) = \x\ = (J2ix<i) . It is obvious
that we have the following two relations
(1.1) A(p2) = 2n,
(1.2) |Vp| = l, x^O.
By integrating (1.1) over the ball B(r) of radius r centered at the origin, we
2nVol(J5(r)) = / A(p2) dVol(x) = f 2p^ dk = 2rA(dB(r))
JB{r) JdB(r) W
where we have used the fact that on the boundary g£ = |Vp| = 1. Therefore,
we have the following identity for the volume function V{r) := Vol(S(r))
(1.3) V{r) = -V'{r).
Of course, the relation (1.3) of the volume and the boundary area of the
Euclidean ball is well known from the elementary geometry. However, (1.1)-
(1.2) can also be used in a rather sophisticated way to prove the following
isoperimetric inequality between the volume and the boundary area of any
bounded region fi C Mn (assume for simplicity that the boundary d£l is
(1.4) A(0ft) > cVol1-1/^).
The constant c obtained in this way, is not the sharp one. As is well-known,
the exact constant c in (1.4) is one for which both sides of (1.4) coincide for
Q, being a ball.
The present work makes consistent use of the hypothesis that, on a
Riemannian manifold M, there exists a distance function4 p^{x) possessing
an upper bound for |V^| and a lower bound for Ap|, where V and A are
the Riemannian gradient and Laplacian, respectively. Given that much, we
produce an isoperimetric inequality of type (1.4).
Furthermore, we derive from the isoperimetric inequality a lower bound
for Afc(^) being the fc-th Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace operator in a
region fi c M. Here is one of our main results, which will be proved at the
end of Section 3. Denote by B^{r) the open p-ball centered at £ E M of
4Despite the distance is symmetric in a;, £, we use the asymmetric notation to
emphasize that p^{x) is always considered as a function of rr, with a fixed £. Note
that Pt(x) is not necessarily the Riemannian distance.

Theorem 1.1. Let M be a complete Riemannian manifold of dimension
n > 1. Let p^(x) be a distance function on M such that, for some Ro G
(0, +oo] and all £ G M; the inequalities
(1.5) |V/*| < 1
(1.6) Ap| > 2n
hold inside the ball B^RQ). Then, for any precompact open set Q C M with
smooth boundary and such that
(1.7) Vol(ft)<ei2S,
(1.8) A(dft) > cVol^)1"1/
where e and c are positive constants depending only on n.
Furthermore, if, for a positive integer k,
(1.9) Vol(Q)<sR
(1.10) Afc(fi) > a(.
with some a = a(n) > 0.
If RQ = oo, that is, (1.5) and (1.6) hold all over M, then the restrictions
(1.7) and (1.9) are void, and we get (1.8) for all Q and (1.10) for all ft and
If i?o < oo then the isoperimetric inequality (1.8) is claimed to be true
only for fi with a small enough volume. However, whatever is Vol(f2), the
condition (1.9) is satisfied for k large enough, namely for
Therefore, the lower bound (1.10) is true for all \k(fi>) with such k.
The following smoothness of p is assumed: p^ is Lipschitz in B^(Ro) and
p| is C00 in B^(Ro). We can prove the same result assuming only that p^
972 Fang Chung, Alexander Grigor'yan and Shing-Tung Yau
is Lipschitz in B^RQ), provided (1.6) holds in the sense of distributions.
However, in the latter case, the proof involves some technical complications
which make the argument less transparent and which are avoided by taking
Pt being smooth enough. r
Let us consider some examples when the hypotheses (1.5) and (1.6) hold.
Example 1.2. Let p be the geodesic distance on M. Then (1.5) is satis-
fied automatically. Suppose that M is a Cartan-Hadamard manifold, that
is, a simply connected geodesically complete non-compact manifold with
non-positive sectional curvature. The inequality (1.6) is satisfied, by the
comparison theorem for the Laplacian (see ). Thus, Theorem 1.1 applies
on such a manifold, with RQ — oo.
The isoperimetric inequality (1.8) on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds was
first proved by Hoffman and Spruck .
Example 1.3. Let M be a n-dimensional minimal submanifold of M^ and
let pz(x) be the Euclidean distance function in R^ restricted to M. The
inequality (1.5) is trivially satisfied. The well-known fact that the coordinate
functions in RN are harmonic on M (see, for example, ) implies that, for
the Laplacian on M,
(1.11) Ap| = 2n.
Thus, all the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1 are satisfied.
The isoperimetric inequality on minimal surfaces was originally proved
by Bombieri, De Giorgi and Miranda (see also ). Michael and Simon
 proved a similar result for more general submanifolds of R^.
Example 1.4. Let M be a manifold with non-positive sectional curvature
and let RQ be its injectivity radius. Then (1.6) holds for the geodesic distance
p. If, in addition, manifold M is a compact then we may take ft = M (the
Dirichlet boundary condition disappears though when considering Afc(M))
and obtain the lower bound (1.10) for Afc(M) provided
(1.12) k>^l.
Example 1.5. Let us show that one cannot in general obtain the estimate
(1.10) for the lower eigenvalues. Indeed, let M consist of / disjoint copies of
a compact n-dimensional manifold K for which the hypotheses of Theorem
1.1 hold. For example, K may be a flat torus, and RQ may be its injectivity

radius (see the previous example). Then (1.5) and (1.6) hold also on M with
the same RQ and P((x) (define p^(x) to be a huge constant when x and £
belong to different copies of K). By Theorem 1.1, we have the lower bound
(1.10) for Ajb(M) provided k satisfies (1.12).
On the other hand, for any k < Z, we have Afc(M) = 0, because the
eigenvalue 0 has the multiplicity I. Hence, the lower bound (1.10) fails if
* " " Vol(IO '
We see that the restriction (1.12) on fe has a correct (linear) order in Vol(M).
Of course, one may obtain from this example a connected manifold M, by
gluing all the copies of K by thin tubes.
Denote by p(t, x, y) the heat kernel of the Laplace operator on M and
by h(B) the Cheeger constant of an open set B C M, that is,

Our contribution here is twofold:
974 Fang Chung, Alexander Grigor'yan and Shing-Tung Yau
1. the usage of the above chain of implications, which is new by itself
(although most steps considered separately may be not new);
2. the proof of the implication (1.14)=»(1.15) under the restriction (1.7).
For the latter, we use a localized (and simplified) version of the argument of
Michael and Simon - The hypothesis (1.14) contains already some initial
lower bound for A(dQ) provided Q lies in a ball of radius RQ. However,
even if Vol(fi) is small as in (1.7), fi may be long and thin and may be not
contained in any such ball. To prove the isoperimetric inequality (1.15) for
such fi, we use a certain ball covering argument - see Steps 2 and 3 of the
proof of Theorem 2.1 below.
All other implications are relatively well-known, but we provide full
proofs for the sake of completeness, especially as our setting does not al-
together match those in the previous works. The part (1.13) =>(1.14) is
obtained simply by integration of (1.13) over Q C B (see (2.10)). Inequality
(1.14) can be restated as follows: for any fl c B(r)
(1.19) A(0ft) > -Vol(fi),
which is a weak form of (1.15).
The part (1.15)=>(1.16) is the well-known Cheeger argument (see
also )). It is implemented here as Step 1 of the proof of Theorem 3.1.
The part (1.16)=4>(1.17) is due to the second author and Carron
 . It is presented in Steps 2-3 of the proof of Theorem 3.1.
Finally, the part (1.17)=>(1.18) uses the argument of Cheng and Li 
(see also [15, Corollaries 2.1, 2.2]) and constitutes Step 4 of the proof of
Theorem 3.1. See also Corollary 3.3 for the final statement.
Let us mention that the sharp constant a in (1.10)/(1.18) is still unknown
even for Rn. According to the Polya conjecture , it should be equal to
the constant in the Weyl asymptotic formula. The best known a in Mn is
due to P.Li and the third author (see also ).
In Section 4, we obtain, under the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1, a certain
Sobolev inequality. We use a localized version of the argument of Federer
and Fleming , and Maz'ya , .
In the second part of the paper, we consider the discrete case. Previously,
two of the authors proved that under the assumption of
A^nj^cVol^)1"1^,
for any finite subset Q of a graph F, we can derive Sobolev inequalities for
graphs and establish lower bounds for eigenvalues A/..
Higher eigenvalues on manifolds and graphs 975
However, obtaining the isoperimetric inequalities is not straightforward
if we wish to start with a distance function in the spirit of Theorem 1.1. For
example, the graph distance function, say, for the rectangular lattices Zn,
does not satisfy (1.13). To circumvent this difficulty, we will consider more
than one distance-like functions and we will introduce a notion of spring
ratio v (see definition (6.3) in Section 6). Here we state one of results that
will be proved in Section 6.
The underlying space in the discrete setting is a weighted graph (r, cr)
where a is a measure on the edge set E of F. It induces also a measure fi on
the vertex set V of F (see Section 5 for detailed definitions). Assume that
there are a distance function p^{x) and a function q^{x) of pairs of vertices
£,£ which satisfy the following hypotheses, with some positive constants
i?o, £ and i\
for any vertex £ and for all adjacent vertices x, y G B^RQ),
\pdx)-pdy)\ <!>
\qdx)^Qdy)\ <pdx) +
and, for any x 6 B^RQ),
(1.20) Aq^x)>5,
Here B^(r) is the open p-ball centered at £ of radius r, and A is the discrete
Laplace operator associated with the weight a.
Furthermore, assume that
n := 6iyRo+i > 1,
where the spring ratio ur is as defined in (6.3). Then, for any subset £1 C V
such that /i(f2) < SRQ, we have
a(dn) > c/i^)1-1/
where c and e are positive constants depending on the hypotheses (see The-
orem 6.3).
The analogue of the function q in the case of manifolds would be ^p2, in
which case (1.13) would become (1.20) with 5 = n. However, even for the
rectangular lattice Zn, for all reasonable choices of p and g, the number S
in (1.20) is smaller than n. An additional argument with the spring ratio is
required to recover the isoperimetric dimension n.
976 Fang Chung, Alexander Grigor'yan and Shing-Tung Yau
Under the above hypotheses, we obtain also the eigenvalues estimates
analogous to Theorem 1.1. Most proofs in the graph case are similar to
those in the case of manifolds. In Sections 6 and 7, we pay special attention
to the differences between the discrete and continuous settings.

2. Isoperimetric inequality for weighted manifolds.
By a weighted manifold, we call a pair (M, /x) of a Riemannian manifold
M and a Radon measure // on M. We always assume that measure /i
has a smooth strictly positive density r](x) with respect to the Riemannian
measure. It is well known that a Riemannian structure induces an associ-
ated Laplace operator. Similarly, a weighted manifold possesses a natural
weighted Laplace operator defined by
A/ := i^divfaV/)
where V and div are the Riemannian gradient and divergence, respectively.
It is easy to see that A is formally self-adjoint with respect to measure //.
If 77 = 1 then A is the Riemannian Laplace operator.
Apart from having measure JJ, on M, we assume that M is endowed
with a distance function p^(x) between the points re, £ G M (which is not
necessarily the Riemannian distance). This function should satisfy all usual
axioms of the distance. We use the asymmetric notation for the distance to
facilitate considering it as a function of x, with a fixed f. Denote by
B((r) := {x e M : pfo) < r}
balls associated with p^(x).
We always assume that p((x) is Lipschitz as a function of x and that /?|
is C^-smooth in x, provided x varies in B^(Ro) with a fixed radius RQ. For
example, if p((x) is the Riemannian distance then these assumptions hold
provided i?o is smaller than the injectivity radius of M (which ensures that
x is away from the cut locus of £).
Other notation:

cr - the boundary area which has the density 77 with respect to the Rieman-
nian Hausdorff measure of codimension 1;
Afc(ft) - the fc-th Dirichlet eigenvalue of —A in the region ft c M.
Theorem 2.1. Let M be a geodesically complete manifold. Assume that
there exists RQ > 0 such that, for any £ G M, the following inequalities hold
in the ball B^(Ro):
(2.1) |V*| < 1
(2.2) Ap| > 2n,
with some constant n > 1. Assume also that, for any £ G M; we have
(2.3) u^pffll^,
with some constant UJ > 0. Let ft 6e an open subset of M with smooth
boundary such that
(2.4) /.(ft) < jl%.
(2.5) <T{dto)>cn{£lf-xln,
c = 2 l-2n (l)
Remark 2.2. Constant c is not claimed to be sharp.
Remark 2.3. Manifold M may be not geodesically complete. However, ft
must be then precompact. More precisely, we need in the proof that the
intersection of ft with any ball is precompact.
Remark 2.4. Condition (2.3) holds automatically if n is the dimension of
M and if // is the Riemannian measure. However, in general, condition (2.3)
cannot be dropped. Indeed, let M = Rl with I > n and let p^{x) = \x — £|.
Then Ap| = 21 > 2n so that (2.2) is satisfied. However, ^B^R^ -> 0 as
R —► 0, and (2.3) fails. Clearly, the isoperimetric inequality (2.5) does not
hold, for example, when ft is a ball, in which case we have
a(dQ)^^(Q)1'1/l = o(ljL(Q)1''1/n) as ^(ft) -> 0.

Proof. For any £ E M, let us introduce the following functions defined for
r e (0,+oo):
(2.6) me(r) := //(fi nB^r))
(2.7) 5?(r) :=(7(afin5^(r)).
STEP 1. We claim that following inequality holds
(2.8) -^:(r^me(r))<r^(r),
for almost every r G (0, RQ).
Since the point £ will be fixed for a while, we skip the subscript £
from all notation. By Sard's theorem, for almost all r, each of the sets
{x G M : p{x) = r} and {x G <9fi : p\dci(x) = r} contains no critical points
of p. Therefore, the former set, which is dB(r), is a smooth hypersurface on
M transversal to dQ.
In other words, the boundary of the set Qr := ft D B(r),
(2.9) dnT = (dn H B(r)) U (dB(r) n fl) ,
consists of two hypersurfaces which intersect transversely for almost every
For every such r, let us integrate (2.2) over Qri pre-multiplied by 1/2,
assuming r G (0, RQ). We obtain, by using the Green formula, (2.1) and
p(x) < r in J3(r) (see Fig. 1)
n/x(£V) < - / Ap2 dji
<r f \Vp\ , dcr
(2.10) < r(T(dSlr).
Taking into account the splitting (2.9) and definitions (2.6), (2.7) we rewrite
(2.10) as follows:
nm(r) < r<T{&Cl D B{r)) + rcr(dB(r) n to)
(2.11) =rs(r) + r-^.

Figure 1: Ball B(r) and set fi
Finally, dividing (2.11) by rn+1, we obtain (2.8).
STEP 2. Let us denote
(2.12) ro:=(-/i(ft)
and prove that, for any £ € fi, there exists r e (0, ro) such that
We start with the following elementary fact.
Lemma 2.5. Let /(r) be an absolutely continuous positive function on
(0, oo) (see Fig. 2). Assume that, for some ro > 0, C E (0,4) and for
almost every r G (0, ro), we have
-/'(r) < -/(4r).

By replacing in the left-hand side of (2.15) /(ro) by sup(r0j4roj / and by

Let us now prove (2.13). Assume from the contrary that, for all r G
s(r) < m(4r).
(where we suppress again the subscript £). Observe that (2.4) and (2.12)
imply ro < i?o- Therefore, we can use (2.8) and write
-— (r-nm(r)) < —(4r)-nm(4r),
for almost every r G (0,ro).
Next we apply Lemma 2.5, for function /(r) = r~nm{r) and for C — 2,
which yields
(2.17) sup r~nm(r) < 5 sup r~nm{r).
re(0,ro) rG(ro,4ro)
The left-hand side of (2.17) is bounded from below by a;, by the hypothesis
(2.3). The right hand-side of (2.17) can be bounded from above by using
the fact that m (r) < /i(fi), for all r > 0. Thus, (2.17) implies, together with
the definition (2.12) of ro,
" < 3rMfi) = ^
which is a contradiction.
STEP 3. We will prove here that
(2.18) (7(0«) > /i(ft),
where ro is defined by (2.12). Clearly, (2.18) implies (2.5).
To prove (2.18), let us recall that, for any point £ G $1, there exists
r = rf G (0,ro) such that (2.13) holds. Then, for any x G fi, we have, by
(2.19) (j{dSl n Bx{rx)) > /i(n n Bx{4rx)).
Let us show that there exists a countable set T C O of points x such
that all balls {-B:E(ra;)}x€r are disjoint whereas the balls {5a;(4ra;)}a,€r cover
fi. If such a family of balls is found already, then we just add up (2.19) for
all x G T and obtain (2.18).
Thus, we are left to prove the following statement.
982 Fang Chung, Alexander Grigor'yan and Shing-Tung Yau
Lemma 2.6. (The well-known ball covering argument). Let (M, d) be a
metric space with a countable base. Suppose that any point x from a set
Q C M is assigned a metric ball Bx(rx) of radius rx G (0, ro). Then there
exists a (at most countable) set S C fi such that all balls Bx(rx), x G 5; are
disjoint whereas the union of the balls Bx(£rx), x G S, covers all of the set
Proof We construct by induction a sequence of points xi which will form
the set 5, and an auxiliary decreasing sequence of at most countable sets
Ti C Cl. Here i = 0,1,2,... is an integer if fi is a compact but, in general, i
is a transfinite number so that we have to use the transfinite induction.
By the countable basis hypothesis, there exists a countable family of
balls Bx(rx) which covers Q as well. Let To be the set of their centers (there
will be no point XQ).
Given i > 1 and assuming that Tj has been already constructed for all
j < i, let us denote
The inductive process stops at step i if T* is empty.
Otherwise, choose a point Xi G T* so that
(2.20) u :=rXi > - sup rx.
Let us throw away from T* all points x such that
(2.21) d(x, xi) <ri + rx
and denote by Ti the rest of T* (see Fig. 3).
Let us prove following two properties of the sequence {xi}:
(i) Hi ^ j then the balls BXi(ri) and BXj{rj) are disjoint;
(ii) the union of all balls BXi{4ri) covers £1
Proof of (i). By the construction of T;, for any x G T*, the inequality
(2.21) fails, which implies that BXi{ri) and Bx(rx) are disjoint. The same
property is true for the previous inductive steps: for any x G T/, j < i,
the balls Bx.(rj) and Bx(rx) are disjoint. This can be applied for x = xi
because xi G T* C Tj, whence (i) follows.

Figure 3: Constructing of Xi and Ti
As a consequence of (i) we see that the points Xi and Xj are different
for different i and j. This implies that the inductive process will stop at
some i because all Xi belong to the countable set To whereas the set of all
transfinite numbers is uncountable.
Proof of (ii). It suffices to show that any ball ^(r^) centered at To
is covered by one of the balls BXi{Ari). For any x E To, there exists the
smallest transfinite number i such that x ^ Ti (indeed, as was shown above,
for all i large enough, Ti is empty whence x £ Ti). Hence, for any j < i, we
have x e Tj, which implies x G T* and x e T* \Ti. By construction, we
have (2.21) and rx < ^n (the latter follows from (2.20)), whence
d(x, Xi) +rx< (ri + rx) + rx = ri + 2rx < An .
Therefore, Bx(rx) is covered by BXi{Ari).

3. Eigenvalues of subsets.
Theorem 3.1. Let us assume that, for any open precompact set Q C M
with smooth boundary such that
the following inequality holds
(3.1) ^(dft^c/i^)1-1/
where c > 0; VQ > 0 and n > 1 are constants. Then, for any open precompact
open set Q C M and for any integer k such that
v / ft m.),
where a = e~ -2/n2- -Hn + 2)1-2/"c2.
Proof The proof consists of four steps.
STEP 1. We first prove Theorem 3.1 for k = 1. We replace hypothesis
(3.2) by a weaker assumption // (fi) < VQ, which suffices in this case. The
following argument is due to Cheeger and Maz'ya, .
Given a non-negative function / 6 CQ0 (£}), we denote
fit = {x : f{x) > t).
Since /x(fit) < ^o and, by Sard's theorem, the boundary Sfi* is smooth,
for almost all £, we may apply the isoperimetric inequality (3.1) for fit and
(3.4) ^(dfit^c/^fit)1-1771,
for almost alH.
Next, we use the co-area formula
(3.5) / |V/| dn= [ G{dSlt)dt,

similar statements in and .
Lemma 3.2. Assume that, for any open precompact setQcM such that

986 Fang Chung, Alexander Grigor'yan and Shing-Tung Yau
the following inequality holds

/ ud/jt = a and / u dfi = /?.
Then, for any s > so := a/vo,
(3.10) / |V^|2 d/x > (/? - 2sa) A^a).

Therefore, if s > so := ^5 then the set Qs := {u > s} (see Fig. 4) satisfies
the hypothesis (3.9), whence

This implies

We summarize the above inequalities in the following one:
/ V< dp > F((3) := -

(n+2^+2/n /31+2/n, /3>(n + 2H-1,

(n + 2)VQ1. In this range, (3.14) is a Nash type inequality. Nash used
a similar inequality to obtain upper bounds of the heat kernel. So we do in
the next step.
STEP 3. For any precompact region ft C M, we denote by pn(t, x, y) the
Dirichlet heat kernel in fi; that is, the kernel of the minimal heat semigroup
etA in fi with respect to the measure (JL (see , , , for detailed
definition and properties of heat kernels).
Let us prove that, for any fi, the heat kernel admits the following upper
bound, for all t > 0 and x E fi,
pn{t,x,x) < max (KQ, Kr^ ,

Fix a; G Jl and denote
By the semigroup property and by the symmetry of the heat kernel, we have
'^(*) — Pn(2^, x, x). Denote also u(t, y) = pn(*? a;? 2/)- The heat equation
implies, by multiplying by -u and by integrating over O, that
r(t) = -2 / |Vw|2 dM(y).
Since /n u(t, y) d^y) < 1, we can apply (3.14), which yields
(3.17) I'(t) < -2F(I).
Function I(t) is decreasing in t, and I(t) —> oo as t I 0. We would like to
integrate (3.17) when I(t) stays in the range ((n + 2)v^"1, oo). This means
that the variable t should vary within (0, to), where I (to) = (n + 2)v^1. By
integrating (3.17) from 0 to t < to, we obtain
and (see Fig. 6)
(3.18) I(t) < c-n (n + 2)n/2+1 t-n/2.
Thus, if I(t) > (n + 2)^1, then (3.18) holds. Otherwise, I(t) < (n +
2)VQ1, and we can write, for all t > 0,
I(t) < max ((n + 2)^1, c"" (n + 2)n/2+11""/2)
and, changing t to t/2
Pn(*, x, x) < max ((n + 2)^1, c-n2n/2 (n + 2)n/2+11""/2) .

modification of the argument of Cheng and Li .

(3.19) / pn(t, x, x) dii(x) < n (ft) max (KQ, Krnl2\ .
By the trace formula, we have, for any k > 1,

By putting together Theorem 2.1 and 3.1, we obtain the following Corol-
Corollary 3.3. Under the hypotheses of Theorem 2.1, for any precompact
open set Q C M and for any integer k > 1 such that
where K = «(n), we have
where a = c\(n)u)2ln > 0.
Indeed, by Theorem 2.1, we have the isoperimetric inequality

Theorem 1.1 from Introduction is a particular case of Theorem 2.1 and
Corollary 3.3, for n = dimM and for // being the Riemannian measure. The

4. Sobolev inequality.
Let us introduce the notation
Theorem 4.1. Assume that, for any precompact open set Q C M with
smooth boundary, such that
the following inequality holds
(4.i) a(dn) > c^n)1-1/
where c > 0; VQ > 0 and n > 1. Then, for any Lipschitz function f with
compact support, the following inequality holds
(4.2) f \Vf\dfi + ce(Qo) f \f\dfi>c2-1/n ( \f\^ dfi
where Q,Q = {x G M : \f(x)\ > 0} and
{ ;"~,K-1/i(n)1-1/B

Furthermore, for any p G [l,n); we have
(4.3) C ||V/H,, + cG(fio) H/H, > c21/P-i-i/«
TO^/I some constant C = C(n,p) > 0.
Remark 4.2. In inequality (4.2), one can get rid of the term 2-1/n provided
M^o) < ^o- In this case, we get the inequality
(4.4) / \Vf\dn>c\[ Ifl^dp
where the constant c is sharp - see , , .

Proof. Let us first prove (4.2). Without loss of generality, we may assume
/ G Cfj°{M) and / > 0. Denote «* := {x : f(x) > t} (see Fig. 8).
Let to be large enough so that
/i(^to) <^0
(such to always exists). Then, for any t > to, we have also /^(Ctt) < ^o and,
by hypotheses, the isoperimetric inequality (4.1) holds for fit, that is
The co-area formula (3.5) implies
/ |V/| dfi> [ a(dQt) dt
(4.6) / |V/| dp > c / /A (fit)1"1771 dt = c n (nto+s)~ ds.
Let us use the inequality of Hardy, Littlewood and Polya which says
that, for any non-negative non-increasing function h on (0, oo) and for any
noo [" roo 1 1/OL
/ h1/a(s)ds> / h(s)d(sa)

If fi(Qo) < ^o then we can take to = 0 and obtain from (4.6)-(4.7) the
sharp Sobolev inequality (4.4). This is the classical way of proving the
Sobolev inequality, which is due to Federer - Fleming and Maz'ya ,
[23, Section 2.3.3].
In general, to may be positive. We apply the elementary inequality
(x + y)a<2«-1(x<* + y«),
which holds for all a > 1 and positive x, y, and obtain

Let us choose to now to satisfy (4.5). If ^(fio) ^ ^o then we take to = 0
and obtain (4.4). If /u(f2o) > vo, then we observe that

Fang Chung, Alexander Grigor'yan and Shing-Tung Yau
Therefore, (4.5) is satisfied for
(4.11) to = - f fd/A.
For this to, we deduce form (4.10)
f IV/l^ + c^V^o)1"17" f fdfi>c2-1/n f f^dp
which was to be proved.
Now we prove (4.3). Denote </:=(/ — to)+ and G := {g > 0} = nto.
By the choice of to, we have //(G) < VQ. Therefore, as was shown above, the
function g satisfies the Sobolev inequality (4.4). Moreover, (4.4) holds as
well for the function g^, for any K > 1. Applying also the Holder inequality,
r r '\ 1/p r r , , 11/q
where q is defined by | + i = 1. Choose K = ^^ so that

Then after obvious simplifications, (4.12) implies

5. Analysis on weighted graphs.
Let F denote a connected graph with the vertex set V and the edge set E.
For vertices x, y e V, we write x ~ y if a: and y are neighbors in F, that is,
x and y are adjacent and joined by an edge, which will be denoted by xy.
Here we consider locally finite graphs i. e., every vertex has a finite number
of neighbors.
For a subset fi of vertices in F, we denote by dQ, the set of edges which
join a vertex in ft with a vertex outside ft. We normally assume that each
edge in dft is oriented so that it points outwards from ft unless otherwise
specified.
5.1. Measures on graphs.
We consider a weighted graph in which each edge e is associated with a
positive edge weight ae. For any edge set S C B, we define its measure by
*($) = $>..
If edge e connects vertices x, y then we write also ae = aXy = ayX.
Extend the function aXy by zero for those x and y which are not neighbors
so that it becomes a (symmetric) function on V x V. Depending on the
context, we may regard aXy as a measure on edges or as a function on pairs
of vertices.
998 Fang Chung, Alexander Grigor'yan and Shing-Tung Yau
For any vertex x e V, we introduce the vertex weight
{2/:2/^a;}
For example, if ae = 1 on all edges then //^ is the number of neighbors of the
vertex x, that is, the degree of x. We regard fix as a measure on vertices.
Namely, for any subset Q of vertices, we define
A graph F equipped with the weight a (and its derivative - measure ^)
is called a weighted graph and is denoted by (F, a).
5.2. Discrete Laplacian.
Given a real-valued function / on the vertex set of (F, <T), we consider its
gradient V and the Laplace operator A. The gradient of / assigns the
following value to each ordered pair x, y G V
Vxyf = m-m-
Expression V/ can also be considered as a function on oriented edges: if
e = xy then Vef = VXyf.
The Laplace operator A is defined on all functions / on V as follows:
(5.1) Af(x) = — E (Vxy/K^— E f(y)<r*v-f(*)'
{y:y~x} {y:y~x}
The matrix of A has in the bases {Sx}xev t^e following components
A(x1y) = l a*vl*°> X^y'
K 'UJ \ -1, x = y.
Although this matrix is not symmetric, in another basis \ fix ' 5X > , the
Laplace operator is represented by a symmetric matrix
A(x v) = l axy ^^)"1/2 ' x^y
y 'y) \ -1, x = y.
See for more details.
Higher eigenvalues on manifolds and graphs 999
5.3. Green's formula.
The following discrete analogue of the Green formula is true. If Q is a finite
subset of V and / is a function on ft then
(5.2) Y, Af(x>
> /** = Z(V^) ^v = S (Ve/)ae •
xeQ xeQ eedQ
If / and g are functions on V and one of them has a finite support then
J2 A/fc) g(x) Afe = -^ £ (V:c^) (V:c^) ff*tf = " 2 (Ve/) (Ve5) ^ •
The multiple 5 appears in the middle term because each edge counts twice.
In the third term, each edge may be oriented arbitrarily because the product
(Ve/) (VeflO does not depend on the choice of orientation.
5.4. Integration versus Summation.
Most of the proofs in the case of graphs follow the same line of arguments
as in the case of manifolds. This becomes especially clear if we write down
the basic facts from analysis on graphs in terms of integration against the
measures /i and a. By suppressing the subscripts of //, a and V, we can
y2f(x)tAx= / fd/A,
^|Ve/|ae= f \Vf\dG,
Y,^ef){Veg)ae= f VfVgda,
where /, g are functions on V.
The Green formula (5.3) can be rewritten, by using the integration, as
(5.4) [ Afgdfi = - f VfVgda,
provided one of the functions f,g has finite support.
1000 Fang Chung, Alexander Grigor'yan and Shing-Tung Yau
5.5. Eigenvalues of Laplacian.
Let Q be a finite subset of vertices of a weighted graph (F, a). Denote by
Co(fi) a class of functions on V which vanish outside fi. We say that a
function / defined on V satisfies the Dirichlet boundary condition in Q, if
/ G Co(f2). Denote by AQ restriction of the Laplace operator A to the space
Co (SI) that is,
The operator AQ is referred to as the Laplace operator with the Dirichlet
boundary condition in £1
As follows easily from the Green formula (5.4), for all /, g G Cb(f2),
[ (Anf)gdfi=- [ VfVgd(j= [ (AQg)fdfi.
In particular, the operator AQ is symmetric with respect to the measure fix
and negative definite.
Let \Q\ denote the number of vertices in fi. The space Co(fi) has the
finite dimension \fl\. Therefore, the operator — A^ has a real positive5 spec-
trum consisting of \il\ eigenvalues Ai < A2 • • • < A|Q|. The corresponding
eigenfunctions <^ G Co(fi) are called the Dirichlet eigenfunctions of Q.
The first eigenvalue Ai(fi) can also be defined by the variational principle

5.6. Heat kernel.
Given a finite set f] C V, we introduce the heat kernel pQ(t,x,y) (where
x, y G V and t > 0) as the kernel of the operator etAn with respect to the
measure //. In other words, for any function / G Co(tt),
etA"f(x) = J m(t,x,y)f(y)diJLy.
The following are the basic properties of the heat kernel pn which follow
directly from the definition.
5 Strictly speaking, this is true if ft is a proper subset of V. If 0 = V then
|fi| < 00 implies Ai (0) = 0 because the constant function is the first eigenfunction.

4. p(0, x, •) = [x-iSx .
5. If {<&}!_! are the eigenfunctions of —An which form an orthonormal
basis in L2(0, /x), and {A;} are the corresponding eigenvalues then
Pn(t,x,y) = ^VuVi(x)<^(y).
In particular, it implies the trace formula
/ pn(t, x, x) dnx = Y] e~tXi ■

/ Pa(t,x,y)dfxy <1.
7. For all x, y and 0 < s <t,
Pa(t,x,y)= / pn(s,x,z)pn(t- s,z,y)dijLz.
5.7. Co-area formula.
The co-area formula (3.5) has a well-known discrete analogue (see, for ex-
ample , , , ).
Proposition 5.1. Given any function f on V, let us denote
nt = {x e V : f(x) > t}.
(5.5) / |V/| da = r G(dSlt) dt.
1002 Fang Chung, Alexander Grigor'yan and Shing-Tung Yau
Proof, For any edge e := xy e E, there corresponds an interval Ie C M which
is defined as follows:
h = [/(y), fix)) iff(x)>f(y).
Also, let us denote
cr(Ie) = aXy.
Then we have
^|V/|^ = i Yl \f(x)-m\(rxy = J2\Ie\a(Ie)
{x,y:x~yy e£;E
where \Ie\ is the Euclidean length of the interval Ie.
The boundary <9f^ consists of edges e = xy such that x G fit and y ^ fi^
This is equivalent to f(x)>t and f(y) < t which, in turn, can be written
as t e Ie- Thus, we have
ee^fit {e:Ie3t} eeE
Finally, by interchanging the summation and the integration, we obtain
whence (5.5) follows. D
6. Discrete isoperimetric inequality.
6.1. Statement of the results.
The purpose of this section is to prove a graph analogue of Theorem 2.1.
As was mentioned in Introduction, in other to do so we need some more
structure on the graph.
We will consider distance functions on V. The simplest example of a
distance function on V is the graph distance which is, by definition, the
number of edges in the shortest edge path joining two points of V. We
assume that we are given some distance function on V and denote it by
/9^(x), where :r,£ G V. Denote by B^(x) the ball defined by p, that is,
B((r) = {x: pe(x) <r}.
Higher eigenvalues on manifolds and graphs 1003
Figure 9: Example: fii = 2 and iix = 5
Let us assume that p^ has the following property:
(6.1) |V^| < 1,
for any edge xy G E and for any vertex f G V. For example, (6.1) obviously
holds for the graph distance.
Next, we will need the following constant characterizing a structure of
edges at the boundary of the ball B^(r). Given points £, x G V, consider the
following sum of aXy over all points y adjacent to x and satisfying p^(y) <
(6.2) ,!£>= £
{y:y~x and p^(y)<p^(x)}
Clearly, /4r < Px (see Fig. 9). We define the spring ratio j/r, for any r > 0,
as follows
(6.3) z/r = inf
Fang Chung, Alexander Grigor'yan and Shing-Tung Yau
Figure 10: Z2 with the metric p^(x) = maxi \xi - ^| has the spring ratio
i/r = 4 (/xx = 4 and max/i^ = 1)
Example 6.1. We consider the graph (r,cr) with the vertex set Zn and
with the measure
1, if x and y differ exactly at one coordinate by 1,
otherwise.
For vertices x, £ € Zn, we define the distance by
(6.4) pe(x) = max |x<-^|.
Clearly, |VxyPc(a:)| < 1 and (6.1) is satisfied. The p-ball B^r) is a cube
centered at f and with the sides parallel to the coordinate axis. Let us find
the spring ratio i/r defined by (6.3). Assume for simplicity that f is the origin.
Any point x ^ £ has at most one neighbor y such that max* \yi\ < max; |^|,
that is pf(y) < p^x). Thus, ^ = 1 or 0. Since fix = 2n, we conclude
i/r = 2n (see Fig. 10).
Together with the function p((x), we consider another function q^(x) -
an analogue of the square distance. We postulate the following properties
of g, for some positive constants 5, L and JRQ'
(i) qe(x) > 0, and q^x) = 0 if and only if x = f.
Higher eigenvalues on manifolds and graphs
(ii) For any vertex £ and for arbitrary adjacent vertices x,y € JB^(JRO),
(6.5) VX2/^<^(x) + 6;
clearly, we can always assume that
(6.6) L > 1.
(iii) For any vertex £ and all x E B^(Ro)^
(6.7) Aq^x) > 5.
Example 6.2. Let (F, cr) be the rectangular lattice graph defined on Zn as
in Example 6.1. Let us consider
p£(x) = max \xi -£;|
In other word, p^(x) is the /^-distance whereas q^(x) is determined by the
Z2-distance. Condition (i) is obvious. Let us verify (ii) and (iii), assuming
for simplicity that £ is the origin.
For x ~ y, we know that y is obtained from x by changing by 1 of one of the
coordinates of x. Let this coordinate be xi. Since \xi\ < pfa), we obtain
(see Fig. 11)
V^ = - ((*i ± I)2 + xl + ... + xl) - - Y, xi2 = ±x1 + 1 < pfc) + i
whence (ii) follows.
To verify (iii), for any y ~ x, we denote by yf the vertex symmetric to y
with respect to x.
The contribution of the points y and y' to the sum (5.1), defining the
Laplace operator A^(x), is equal to (see Fig. 12)

Since we have n such pairs of neighbors of x, and iix = 2n, we see that
and (6.7) is satisfied with S = 1/2.
We remark that neither of other natural choices of q such as
qW = \(X,\xi\\
q(x) = -maxN2,
admits both (6.5) and (6.7) with 6 > 1/2.
Definition. Given positive numbers 5, L and i?o, we say that a weighted
graph (F, a) has property P(5,6, RQ) if there exist a distance function p
satisfying (6.1) and a function q satisfying the hypotheses (i)-(iii) such that
(6.8) n := 5vRo+i > 1,
where VRQ+I and S come from (6.3) and (6.7) respectively.
The claim that a graph has property P(J, £, RQ) contains two different
issues. First, it means the existence of functions p and q as above. Second,
it means that the number n defined by (6.8) is greater than or equal to 1.
In particular, a small 5 in (6.7) is allowed provided it is compensated by a
large spring ratio VRQ+I defined by (6.3). In what follows, the number n will
play the role of the isoperimetric dimension.
It will be more convenient for us to replace the argument 6 in P(5, £, RQ)
by n because 6 will be used only through n. So, by somewhat abusing the
notation, we will refer to the property P(n, L, RQ) rather than to P(5, *,, RQ).
The value of the number L is not of much importance. We will assume L > 1
as in (6.6).
Note that Proposition 6.5 in the next section states that the property
P(n, *,, Po) implies the following lower bound of the volume of any ball of
radius r < RQ:
n{Bt{r))>bHrn,
where b = 6(6, n) > 0. Moreover, the following isoperimetric inequality is
1008 Fang Chung, Alexander Grigor'yan and Shing-Tung Yau
Theorem 6.3. Assume that the weighted graph (F, a) has property
P(n,L,Ro). Assume also that
(6.9) u/ := inf aXy > 0
and denote
u> := inf IJ,X ,
Let Q be a finite subset of V such that
(6.10) tin) < ^RI
(6.11) e:=8Lne2n2.
(6.12) cr(dQ) > c/^)1"1/
where c := 4-ri-3z/^o
+1^-1e-2na;/a;1/n-1.
As an immediate consequence of Theorem 6.3 (with RQ = oo) and Ex-
amples 6.1 and 6.2, we have the following:
Corollary 6.4. For the lattice graph on Zn, for any finite subset Q of ver-
ticeSy we have
a(dn) > c/x^)1"1/
where c = c(n) > 0.
The constant c obtained in this way is not optimal. See for the sharp
constant c in Zn.
Let us emphasize that Theorem 6.3 is not a straight analogue of Theorem
2.1. To start with, in the setting of manifolds, we needed only one distance
function p. However, also for manifolds, we can choose the function q by
(6.13) q=±p2.

Figure 13: Graph C5 x Z1
We have then \Vq\ < p which follows from |Vp| < 1 and which is the
analogue of (6.5). The hypothesis (2.2) takes the form
which is the analogue of (6.7). The reason why we do not assume the relation
(6.13) for the graphs, is that we do not know whether there exists a function
p on Zn such that (6.5) and (6.7) hold with q = \p2.
There is a more substantial difference between the continuous and dis-
crete case. In the case of manifolds, the isoperimetric dimension n comes
directly from the lower bound of Ag as in (6.14). In the case of graphs, n
is the product of two quantities 8 and z/ = I/J^+I that come from different
hypotheses. The spring ratio v has no analogue for manifolds. It is clear
that the Laplace operator of the distance function on a graph does not catch
the isoperimetric dimension as we have seen for Zn. The spring ratio v helps
"to see" the dimension.
One may wonder if it is possible to catch the sharp isoperimetric inequal-
ity only by using the spring ratio. The answer is negative.
Indeed, let us consider graph Y which is the direct product of a cycle
Ck with an odd fc and Z1 (see Fig. 13); in other words, T is a discrete
cylinder based on Ck- Let the distance p on F be the maximum of the graph
distances in Ck and in Z1, analogously to (6.4). It is easy to see that vr = 4
for this graph (for any r > 1) exactly as for Z2. However, the isoperimetric
dimensions of Z2 and Ck x Z1 are clearly different.
The rest of this Section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 6.3.

6.2. Boundary of a ball.
We start with the following statement establishing relation between the
boundary area of a ball and its volume.
Proposition 6.5. Assume that the weighted graph (F, cr) has property
P(n, L, Ro). Then, for any value r G [0, RQ) and any vertex £ € V, we
(6.15) aiPBfr)) > -jr/itoM)
(6.16) M5?(r))>&M^n,
(6.17) b = rnexp(-n2).
Proof. For simplicity, we will write v = VRQ+I and B(r) = J5^(r). To prove
(6.15), we sum up the inequality (6.7) pre-multiplied by /xx, over the ball
B(r) and use the Green formula (5.2). We obtain
(6.18) Sfi(B(r))< J2 &q(x)Vx= Y, Fxyfi^y
xeB(r) xeB(r)
Of course, the summation on the right-hand side of (6.18) is restricted to
adjacent re, y. Therefore, we can use the hypothesis (6.5), which states tha,t
VX2/<? < p(x) + L<r + L.
Thus, (6.18) implies
(6.19) <WM) < (r + 0 <r(dB(r)),
which proves (6.15).
Next we prove that, for all r e [0, i?o),
(6.20) fi(B(r + 1)) - vL(B(r)) > -—/x(B(r)).

Figure 14: The edges at x contributing to a(dB(r)) are bold whereas the
others are dashed
In the view of (6.19) and (6.8), inequality (6.20) will follow from
(r(OB(r))<-QjL(B(r + l))-rtB(r)))
where we write u = VRQ+I .
Let us verify (6.21). The hypothesis (6.1) implies that if x is adjacent
to y e B(r) then x e B(r + 1). Therefore, any edge e e dB(r) connects a
vertex y G B(r) with a vertex x e B(r + 1) \ B(r) whence
a(dB(r)) < £ a.. xy '
xeB{r+l)\B(r)
Fix a vertex x € B(r + 1) \ B(r) and consider all edges e which join x with
a vertex y in B(r) (see Fig. 14).
1012 Fang Chung, Alexander Grigor'yan and Shing-Tung Yau
The sum of c7Xy over all such y is at most jix as defined by (6.2). Therefore,
a{dB{r)) < Y. I®'
xeB{r+l)\B{r)
From the definition (6.3) of the spring ratio, we know that
a(dB(r)) < i J2 ^ = l» Wr + 1) \ B(r)) ,
a:€B(r+l)\B(r)
which proves (6.21) and, thus, (6.20).
Clearly, (6.20) can be rewritten as
(6.22) M(B(r + l))>(l + —)/i(B(r)).
For an integer r E [1, i?o), we iterate (6.22) to obtain
(6.23) n(B(r)) > riB(p)) fl (l + ^j .
By using the elementary inequality 1 + x > exp(a; — ^rr2) (x > 0), ^(3(0)) =
H^ and L > 1 (see (6.6)) we derive from (6.23)
>A*€f^~J exp(-n2)
(6.24) > fit (lil J exp (-n2) .
Observe that (6.24) is true also for r = 0 because /Li(5(0)) = fj,^.
Finally, for any r € [0, RQ), we obtain
M(B(r)) > MBdrJ)) > Me (:)"«? (-n2)
whence (6.16) follows. □

6.3. Proof of isoperimetric inequality.
Here we prove Theorem 6.3. Let us denote
(6.26) "-(^r
where 9 is defined by (6.11). Hypothesis (6.10) implies that ro < RQ.
Let £ be any point in f} (we may assume that fi is not empty). By
Proposition 6.5 and by the obvious inequality b > 6~l (see (6.17) and (6.11))
fji(B^Ro)) > b^RZ > e^urTS = /x(fi).
Therefore, the complement to fi is not empty which implies that dQ is not
empty, too and, by (6.9), iJ,(dQ) > uJ.
We write then
If we assume that ro is small enough, say, as follows
ro < 2n2 + 1,
then we obtain
C7(0fi) > eI^1(2n2 + if^Ju-^ii^l)1
It follows easily from (6.11) that
^(2n2 + l)1-n>l
whence we conclude
which proves (6.12) for ro < 2n2 + 1.
We may assume in the sequel
(6.26) ro > 2n2 + 1.
The further proof will be split into three steps.
Fang Chung, Alexander Grigor'yan and Shing-Tung Yau
Figure 15: Splitting of 8(0,(1 B(r)) - the dashed edges belong to 9+(r), bold
STEP 1. The boundary d(Q, D B^(r)) can be partitioned into two parts:
a+(r) = {xyeE:xeiln Be(r) and y <£ Ct}
0-(r) = {xy e E : x € tt fl B((r) and y G Q \ B^r)}
(see Fig. 15). Denote
raf(r) :=/x(Sf(r)nfi).
We claim that the following inequality holds, for all r £ [0, RQ],
(6.27) m€(r) - me(r + 1) + —— m€(r) < v<r(d?(r)),
where u = I/HQ+I.
The point £ will be fixed during the proof of (6.27) so we skip the sub-
script £ from all notation. As in the proof of Proposition 6.5, we integrate
(6.7) over Q, fl B(r) and obtain, by the Green formula (5.2),
(6.28) 5m(r)< J^ &Q(x)Vx= ^2 (V^Wy
a:efinB(r) xyed(QnB(r))
Higher eigenvalues on manifolds and graphs 1015
For any edge xy e 0(ftn2?(r)), we estimate V^g by using (6.5). Indeed,
for x G il fl B(r), we have, by (6.5),
Vsyqfc < p^(x) + !, < r + ^
Therefore, we obtain from (6.28)
(6.29) 8m[r) < (r + L)a(d(nn B(r))).
We now prove the following estimate of the measure of d~(r):
(6.30) <r(d~(r)) < -(™<(r + 1) - m(r))-
Indeed, for any edge xy G d~(r) with a; G B(r), (6.1) implies y G B(r + 1).
In order to add up aXy over all xy G <9~(r), we first group those edges xy
with the same end y. Since x G J5(r) and y £ 5(r), the sum of aXy over all
possible x (such that xy G d~(r)) is at most fjUjf', by (6.2). Thus,
^(0-(r)) < E #
y€nn(B(r+l)\B(r))
^ y€nn(B(r+l)\B(r))
= -(m(r + 1) — m(r))
where we have used fiy < i//y (see (6.3)).
By combining (6.29) and (6.30), we conclude
6m(r) < (r + L)a(d+(r)) + ^-±^(m(r + 1) - m(r)),
whence (6.27) follows.
STEP 2. We claim that there exists r G [0,ro] such that
(6.31) <7(d+(r)) > —m(4r),
(6.32) E = 4-ri-1z/-1.
Fang Chung, Alexander Grigor'yan and Shing-Tung Yau
Assume on the contrary that, for all r £ [0, ro], we have
(j(d+(r)) < —m(4r).
Together with (6.27), this yields
m(r) — m(r + 1) H m(r) < —m(4r).
Let us introduce a new function (f)(r) = m{r — L)/rn, which is defined for all
r > L. Replace r by r — L in (6.33) and rewrite the latter as follows:
(6.34) rn(j){r) - (r + l)n0(r + 1) + ~rn0(r) < — (4r)n(/)(4r).
By dividing (6.34) by (r + l)n and by using (6.32), we obtain
v IT* T? v
(6.35) {j^mr) - <f>(r + 1) < —(-^r^Ar) -.-(-^^(r).
Since, for any x 6 and n > 1,
1 - xn < n(l - x),
V + l; -r + l
Therefore,
^(r) - ^(r + 1) = (-^I)»^(r) - </.(r + 1) + 1" (^TT)n
< (—T)n0(r)-0(r- + l)
and (6.35) implies, for /. < r < t + ro,
r + l #r),
^(r) - <j>{r + 1) <
4roVr + r Yy ' rvr + r v '
<-^-^(4r) + —, . .
- 4ro v y r + l V^ + l

Thus, we have
(6.36) ^(r) - #r + 1) < .^^(4r) + (r + 1)2^r)' Vr € ^ ro + 4-
On the other hand, we know also that, for all r > L,
m > mm >«.
We would like to bring to a contradiction using (6.36), (6.37) and (6.38).
L = \2n2 +1] ,
R=[ro + i\.
By (6.26), (6.39) and (6.40), we have
t < L < R < ro + i.
Let us set
(6.41) M := max 0(r).
v ' re[L,R]
r is integer
By iterating (6.36), we obtain, for any integer r e [L,R],

.k=R+l k=L.
4>{k) + n- ,M

It follows from (6.40), (6.39) that R+l > ro, R-L+l < ro and L > 2n2.
Therefore, (6.42) implies
(6.43) ^)_^+i)<^+g+l)M.
Choose r 6 [L, R] so that <^(r) = M and apply (6.37) in the form
rv ' - (R + l)n - r%
Hence, we obtain from (6.43)
'7/i(£) , 3;
whence, by (6.25),
- 4 r? 4 '
M < 7^-^ = 7-.
In particular, this implies
(6.44) ^(L) < 7^
whereas, by (6.38),
(6-45) tfL) > ^.
On the other hand, definitions (6.11) of 6 and (6.39) of L imply
- > ine2n2 > in(l + 2n + 2n2)n > (t + 1 + 2n2)n > Ln
and we see that (6.44) and (6.45) contradict each other.
STEP 3. For each vertex £ 6 fi, we denote by r^ the value of r determined
by (6.31). Therefore, by (6.31), we have
(6.46) <7(af(r))>—/i(fl€(4r€)nn) V£€ft,
(6.47) d£(r) = {uveE:ueQn B^(r) and v <£ Q}.
By Lemma 2.6, there exists a subset T C fi such that

(i) all balls Bx(rx), for x e T, are disjoint;
(ii) the union of the balls ^(^a-), for x G T, covers ft.
We claim that, for distinct x, y e T, the sets of edges d+(rx) and d+(ry)
are disjoint. This is not altogether trivial because the boundaries dBx(rx)
and dBy{ry) may have a common edge (the filled edge on Fig. 16). However,
if there is an edge e G d+(rx) n d+(ry) then the edge e must have a vertex
in ft fl £3(7^) and a vertex in ft fl -ByOy). Due to (i), these vertices are
different. Therefore, both vertices of e belong to O which contradicts the
definition (6.47) of 9+(r).
Hence, all sets d+(rx), xe T, are disjoint whence
(6.48) E^^W)^^5")-
On the other hand, (ii) implies
(6.49) /i(ft) < Y^ KBx(4rx) n ft).
Using (6.49), (6.46), (6.48), (6.25), we obtain
Mn)<X>(£x(4rx)nn)

This implies together with (6.11), (6.32) and UJ > J that
a(aft) > efl-^uZ/Xft)1-1/

7. Eigenvalues and Sobolev inequality on graphs.
Most proofs below follow the same lines as their continuous counterparts in
the previous sections. We emphasize only those places of the proofs which
require additional argument specific to the discrete setup.

Proposition 7.1. In a weighted graph (F, a), we assume that
a(dn) > ciifSl)1-1'
for any SI satisfying /z(ft) ^ ^0, where c > 0; VQ > 0 and n > 1. T/ien the
Dirichlet eigenvalue Ai(fi) satisfies
Ai(n) > yM(fi)-2/n.
Proo/. The proof is almost identical to that in Step 1 of Theorem 3.1. Only
inequality (3.7), which is a part of Cheeger's argument, requires modification
because we cannot use in the graph case the formula V/2 = 2/ V/. However,
the recipe is well known how to overcome this difficulty (see, for example,
 , ). So, we argue as follows:
\ \x,y ) \x,y
- ((X|v/|2'''
7)' fe^w^+E^W/'.
<(2(/£lV/|^).(X/^))
This allows us to follow the rest of the proof as in the continuous case with
a modified constant (off by a factor 2). □
Next Lemma is a straight analogue of Lemma 3.2.
Lemma 7.2. In a weighted graph (F, /x); we assume that for any Q satisfy-
ing ^(£1) < VQ,
Ai(fi) > A(Mft))
1022 Fang Chung, Alexander Grigor'yan and Shing-Tung Yau
where A is a non-negative non-increasing function. Let u(x) denote a non-
negative function defined on the vertex set of T with finite support. We
/ ud/jL = a, and / u dji = (3.
Then for any s > SQ = QL/VQ, we have
\Vu\2da > (/? - 2sa)k(s-la).
Now we are ready to state the following lower bounds for A^ for large k.
Theorem 7.3. In a weighted graph (F, a), we assume that
for any fi satisfying /x(fJ) < VQ, where c > 0, VQ > 0 and n > 1. Then the
Dirichlet eigenvalue Afc(fJ) satisfies
xk(n) > a '
for a = e-2/n(n + 2)1"2/nc2, provided
\n\>k> (n + 2)e/i(fl).
The proof goes the same way as that of Theorem 3.1. The latter used
certain properties of the heat kernel and the Laplace operator which all are
available in the case of a graph as was shown in Section 5. The constant a is
twice as big as one in Theorem 3.1 because we use Proposition 7.1 instead
Combining the above theorem with Theorem 6.3, we obtain the following
Corollary 7.4. Assume that the weighted graph (F, a) satisfies the hypothe-
ses of Theorem 6.3. Then, for any finite set Q C V, the Dirichlet eigenvalue
Afc(f!!) satisfies
Higher eigenvalues on manifolds and graphs
where K = ci(ra) tn > 0 and a = C2(n) ^~2^+ia;/2^2//Tl 2 > 0.
Corollary 7.5. For the lattice graph on Zn, for any finite subset Ct of ver-
tices, we have
where k is any integer between 1 and \Q\ and a = a(n) > 0.
Similarly to Theorem 4.1, we have the following Sobolev inequality
Theorem 7.6. In a weighted graph (F, a), suppose that for a finite subset
Q of vertices with
M(fi) ^ ^o,
the following holds
a(dQ) > cfi(n) l-l/n

Furthermore, for any p € [1, n),
