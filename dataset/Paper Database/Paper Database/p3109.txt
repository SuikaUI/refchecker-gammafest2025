Background: This pilot study conducted at the Peninsula Medical School is one of very few
studies to compare the use of video podcasts to traditional learning resources for medical students.
Methods: We developed written handouts and video podcasts for three common ear, nose, and
throat conditions; epistaxis, otitis media, and tonsillitis. Forty-one second-year students were
recruited via email. Students completed a 60-item true or false statement test written by the senior
author (20 questions per subject). Students were subsequently randomized to podcast or handouts.
Students were able to access their resource via their unique university login on the university
homepage and were given 3 weeks to use their resource. They then completed the same 60-item test.
Results: Both podcasts and handouts demonstrated a statistically significant increase in student scores (podcasts mean increase in scores 4.7, P=0.004, 95% confidence interval =0.07).
Handout mean increase in scores 5.3, P=0.015, 95% confidence interval =0.11). However,
there was no significant difference (P=0.07) between the two, with the handout group scoring
fractionally higher ­(podcasts average post-exposure score =37.3 vs handout 37.8) with a larger
average improvement. A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire demonstrated that medical students
enjoy using reusable learning objects such as podcasts and feel that they should be used more
in their curriculum.
Conclusion: Podcasts are as good as traditional handouts in teaching second-year medical
students three core ear, nose, and throat conditions and enhance their learning experience.

Background
Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgery must compete with many other subjects for space
in undergraduate medical education. As highlighted by Mace and Narula in their review
of ENT education in 26 universities in the United Kingdom, ENT only receives an average of 1.5 weeks in the medical school curriculum and is often taught as a combined
subject with other specialties.1
Consequently, it is imperative for ENT education to be
delivered in an efficient manner and utilize the best methods of delivery available. Medical education is undergoing vast changes. Education no longer follows the traditional
model of instructor-centered education, it is now more centered around independent
learning, with the emphasis on the learner constructing their own knowledge.2
Reusable learning objects (RLOs) are a new method of delivering medical education that incorporate a spectrum of visual, auditory, and interactive learning resources.
A learning object can be defined as a grouping of instructional materials to meet a
specified educational objective. A digital learning object is one which can be electronically stored and may utilize text, graphic, animations, audio, and video to support and

enhance learning. Due to their electronic nature, they can be
considered to be reusable since they can be accessed by many
users if hosted online.3 RLOs are a resource that are designed
to be used in self-directed learning (SDL) and are therefore
an ideal tool to help students in modern medical education.
Video podcasts have the added advantage of engaging
students in both auditory and spatial learning compared to
other SDL tools such as handouts, that allow spatial learning
only. There have only been very few studies that have directly
compared the effect of podcasts with other SDL tools in terms
of learning topics in medicine.4–6 This pilot study compares
the use of podcasts with more traditional handouts in selfdirected education across three common ENT conditions
namely epistaxis, otitis media, and tonsillitis.
Ethics approval and recruitment
The Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry Ethics
Committee approved the study. All second-year medical
students at Peninsula Medical School within the Plymouth
locality (103 students) were notified of the study via university email account. Attached to the email were the study
protocol, a frequently asked questions sheet, and a consent
form. Second-year students were chosen as the target population since they have received no formal ENT teaching in their
prior curriculum. The students were initially given 1 week to
respond to the email. This was extended to 2 weeks with an
email reminder at the end of the first week in order to increase
the chances of gaining a statistically significant sample size.
Randomization
Students were randomized to the podcasts group or the handout group using a computerized random number generator.
Pre-exposure test
Following randomization, the participants were sent a unique
link to a Survey Monkey™ 20 true or false statements for
each of the three topics (epistaxis, tonsillitis, and otitis
media). The questions were written by the senior author, an
ENT consultant from Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust. An
online and remote method was chosen to conduct the entire
study because a previous attempt to invite the students to sit
an exam under exam conditions onsite at the Medical School
had only yielded eight responses. The students were asked
to not use any resources while sitting the test and that it
should take no longer than 10 minutes. The test would “lock”
after one login attempt. Therefore, the test would need to be
completed in one sitting. The 41 respondents were given a
2-week period to complete the test in an attempt to reduce
the dropout rate.
Exposure to resources
Upon completion of the initial exam, the participants were
given access to their allocated learning resource for a 3-week
period. Each resource was hosted on the Peninsula Medical
School’s virtual learning environment (EMILY). The relevant
resource was made visible on the homepage of the student
by using their individual login ID. Therefore, nobody apart
from the investigators was able to see both resources. Students in the handout group were able to save or print their
handouts. Students were requested not to share each other’s
resources or use any supporting material including the printed
­handouts when completing the post-exposure test. There were
no additional instructions, so the students were able to use
their allocated resource as they saw fit.
Post-exposure test
After the completion of the 3-week period, the resources
were removed from EMILY and the students were sent an
email with a link to the same 60-item Survey Monkey™ test
they sat previously. Again, students were given 2 weeks to
complete this under the same conditions as before.
Student questionnaire
Qualitative data regarding level of enjoyment of the learning
resource were also collected from the podcast group in the
form of a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire.
Statistical analysis
Comparisons were made on the students’ performance scores
before and after the interventions. The mean and standard
deviations of the pre- and post-exposure test results of students in both groups were computed and the normality of data
tested using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Mean difference between
pre- and post-exposure scores were calculated for each
group. The Shapiro–Wilk test showed the data to be normally
distributed. These data were then analyzed for a significant
difference using a Student’s paired t-test. The null hypothesis
was that there was no improvement between pre- and post-test
scores in the podcast group when compared with the handout
group. The difference was considered statistically significant
if P=<0.05. The breakdown of the data by subject allowed
us to see whether podcasts were effective across a range of
different subjects, or more effective in some and not others.
The data of the Likert questionnaire were analyzed by
calculating the mode response for each question.

Use of podcasts for medical students
Figure 1 is a flowchart of the study. Forty-one out of 103
students responded to the email inviting them to participate
in the study (39.8%). Thirty out of the 41 students who agreed
to participate in the study completed the pre-exposure test
(73.2%). Eighteen students out of 41 who agreed to participate in the study completed the post-exposure test (43.9%).
Figures 2 and 3 are box plots of test scores pre- and
post-exposure. There was a statistically significant improvement in knowledge scores after provision of both podcasts
and written handouts. Figure 4 illustrates the average postexposure test scores for the podcast and written handouts
groups. The average improvement from the podcast group
was 4.7 (P=0.004, 95% confidence interval =0.07) compared
to 5.3 from the handouts group (P=0.015, 95% confidence
interval =0.11). There was however no statistically significant
difference found between the use of podcasts and written
handouts in improving students’ knowledge scores (average
post-exposure scores 37.8 vs 38.3, P=0.07). Figures 5 and

responses of students in the ­podcast group. The podcast questionnaire showed in addition, that students valued this as a
learning resource and found it to be a more enjoyable method
of learning. The dropout rates post-exposure was identical
in both groups (n=6). Only 40% (n=6) of the podcast group
returned their satisfaction questionnaires.
Discussion
Our study demonstrates that video podcasts are as effective
as written handouts in teaching three common ENT conditions. However, the students’ learning experience in the
podcast group appeared to be enhanced compared to written
information they traditionally use as the podcasts were more
enjoyable. The advantages and disadvantages of RLO’s have
been summarized in Table 1 which is adapted from a literature
review.7 Our findings are supported by the limited literature
available on the use of podcasts for medical students.
Cook published a review on the use of web-based
learning (WBL) in medical education. He concluded that
the advantages of WBL include overcoming barriers of
distance and time, economies of scale, and novel instructional methods. The disadvantages include social isolation,
up-front costs, and technical problems. WBL instructional
designs failed to always abide by educational principles and
may sometimes be used in an incorrect educational context
or application.8
Bhatti et al evaluated the benefit of educating medical
students on a common surgical topic (hemorrhoids), through
a website and podcast package vs a traditional lecture. Similar
to our study, the authors used a pre-intervention questionnaire and an identical post-intervention one. They concluded
that using augmented web-based educational tools reduces
demands on teaching time with no decrease in quality for
selected parts of the curriculum.4
Kumar et al implemented a hybrid curriculum that
involved both traditional teaching methods and a new online
core curriculum that incorporates audio, video, and text using
screen capture technology in a surgical intensive care unit
clinical placement. The curriculum was hosted on a secure
online portal and covered topics that were considered essential to meet the didactic objectives of the rotation. Students
in both groups completed a pre-test on day 1 of the rotation
and a post-test administered on the second to last day of the
rotation. Unlike our study, the authors did not use identical
questionnaires but randomly selected ones before and after
the intervention. Again, the authors found that using this
form of learning enhanced the satisfaction of students on
a busy intensive care unit placement and improved their
knowledge-based test scores.6
A study by Peacock et al came to a different conclusion
from our study. They conducted a prospective observational
study of all medical students undertaking their first attachment in surgery. Students were randomly allocated to four
groups: lecture, handout, website, and patient-based tutorial, all on the management of an inguinal hernia. Although
the knowledge scores improved in the lecture and website
groups, the learning in the website group was thought to be
less engaging for students.5
With the evolution of technology and its ever growing
degree of accessibility, the potential role of video podcasts
in medical education should be recognized and utilized. This
can be especially useful in modern medical degree programs
which favor a problem-based learning approach. These

Figure 6 Students’ opinions on usefulness of video podcasts compared to written
­programs often have limited face-to-face teaching time and
rely on individual independent learning. The use of podcasts
here could help standardize the information which students
are given on a particular topic and can be accessed in their
own time and at their own pace.
The potential implications for teachers involved in
medical education are highlighted in Table 1. However, the
usefulness and enjoyment of podcasts from the perspective
of the clinical teacher goes beyond the scope of this study.
The main limitation of this pilot relates to the number of
participating students as a type II error cannot be excluded.
The results of this study can assist us in calculating the sample
size required to perform a larger scale study. The dropout
rate for students completing voluntary assessments is not
unusual. Similarly, it is not unusual to have low response
rates for study questionnaires. The students did not sit the
test under exam conditions and were able to sit both the pre-
and post-exposure test at any point in a 2-week period. The
investigators were aware of this limitation at the start of the
investigation; however, it was deemed necessary in order to
gain a much larger sample size than was previously obtained.
Although students were requested not to share resources,
there is no way to find out if this has occurred. Providing the
students with the same pre- and post-test assessment could
have led to a “repeat testing bias”. This risk is mitigated by
the fact that students did not have prior experience of ENT
when they sat the first test. Moreover, test equating has its
challenges and using a different test post-exposure carries
the risk of using an assessment that does not have the same
degree of difficulty as the pre-test.
Given that there are very few studies that have looked
at the effectiveness of video podcasts as teaching tools for
medical students,4–6 we therefore propose a definitive followup study that includes more than one medical discipline.
This study has shown that RLOs such as video podcasts are
as good a resource as handouts in terms of knowledge test
scores, but also that they are more enjoyable.
Conclusion
Video podcasts are as good as written handouts in the teaching
and learning of three common ENT conditions. Video podcasts
appear to enhance the students’ learning experience. Further
large-scale studies are required to demonstrate the effectiveness
of podcasts in medical education compared to other widely
used learning resources and involving multiple disciplines.
