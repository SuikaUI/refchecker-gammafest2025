Logistic regression is used to obtain odds ratio in the presence of more than one explanatory variable. The procedure is quite similar to multiple linear regression, with the exception that the response variable is binomial. The result is the impact of each variable on the odds ratio of the observed
event of interest. The main advantage is to avoid confounding effects by analyzing the association of all variables together. In this article, we explain
the logistic regression procedure using examples to make it as simple as possible. After definition of the technique, the basic interpretation of the
results is highlighted and then some special issues are discussed.

Introduction
One of the previous topics in Lessons in biostatistics
presented the calculation, usage and interpretation of odds ratio statistic and greatly demonstrated the simplicity of odds ratio in clinical practice
(1). The example used then was from a fictional
study where the effects of two drug treatments to
Staphylococcus Aureus (SA) endocarditis were compared. Original data are reproduced on Table 1.
Following (1), the odds ratio (OR) of death of patients using standard treatment can be calculated
as (152 x 103) / (248 x 47) = 3.71, meaning that patients at standard treatment present a chance to
die 3.71 times greater than patients under new
treatment. To a more detailed information about
basic OR interpretations, please see McHugh (1).
However, a more complex problem can arise when,
instead of the association between one explanatory variable and one response variable (e.g., type
of treatment and death), we are interested in the
joint relationship between two or more explanatory variables and the response variable. Let us
suppose we are now interested in the relationship
between age and death in the same group of SA
endocarditis patients. Table 2 presents the fictional new data. You ought to remember that those
data are not real data and that the relationships
described here are not meant to reflect any real associations.
Again, we can calculate an OR as (120 x 134 / 217 x
49) = 1.51, meaning that the chance of an younger
individual (between 30 and 45 years-old) death is
about 1.5 times the chance of the death of an older individual (between 46 and 60 years-old). Now,
instead, we have two variables related to the event
of interest (death) at individuals with SA endocarditis. But in the presence of more than one explanatory variable, separately testing each independent variable against the response variable introduces bias into the research (2), Performing
multiple tests on the same data inflates the alpha,
thus increasing Type I error rates while missing
possible confounding effects. So, how do we know

Logistic regression analysis
whether the treatment effect on endocarditis result is being masked by the effect of age? Let us
take a look at the treatment effect as stratified by
age (Table 3).
As table 3 illustrates, the impact of treatment is
higher on younger individuals, because OR in the
younger patients subgroup is higher than in the
older patients subgroup. Therefore, it would be incorrect to simply look at the treatment results
without considering the impact of age. The simplest way to solve this problem is to calculate some
form of “weighted” OR (i.e., Mantel-Haenszel OR
(3)), using Equation 1 below, where ni is the sample
size of age class I, and a, b, c and d are the table
cells, as presented by McHugh (1).
43 × 34 109 × 69
100 × 6 148 × 11
It means that the weighted chance of death associated with standard treatment is 3.74 times the
chance of death of individuals taking new treatment. However, as the number of explanatory variables increases, the complexity of these calculations can become nearly impossible to handle. Additionally, Mantel-Haenszel OR, like the simple OR,
admits only categorical explanatory variables. For
instance, to use a continuous variable like age we
need to set a breaking point to categorize (in our
case, arbitrarily set at 45 years-old) and could not
use the real age. Determining breaking points is
not always easy! But there is a better approach: using logistic regression instead.
Definition
Logistic regression works very similar to linear regression, but with a binomial response variable.
The greatest advantage when compared to Mantel-Haenszel OR is the fact that you can use continuous explanatory variables and it is easier to
handle more than two explanatory variables simultaneously. Although apparently trivial, this last
characteristic is essential when we are interested
in the impact of various explanatory variables on
the response variable. If we look at multiple explanatory variables independently, we ignore the
covariance among variables and are subjected to

Logistic regression analysis
confounding effects, as was demonstrated in the
example above when the effect of treatment on
death probability was partially hidden by the effect of age.
A logistic regression will model the chance of an
outcome based on individual characteristics. Because chance is a ratio, what will be actually modeled is the logarithm of the chance given by:
1 – π = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + ... βmxm
where π indicates the probability of an event (e.g.,
death in the previous example), and βi are the regression coefficients associated with the reference
group and the xi explanatory variables. At this
point, an important concept must to be highlighted. The reference group, represented by β0, is constituted by those individuals presenting the reference level of each and every variable x1...m. To illustrate, considering our previous example, these are
the individuals older aged that received standard
treatment. Later, we will discuss how to set the reference level.
Logistic regression step-by-step
Let us apply a logistic regression to the example
described before to see how it works and how to
interpret the results. Let us build a logistic regression model to include all explanatory variables
(age and treatment). This kind of model with all
variables included is a called “full model” or a “saturated model” and is the best starting option if
you have a good sample size and small number of
variables to include (issues about sample size, variable inclusion and selection and others will be discussed in the next section. For now, we will keep it
as simple as possible).
The result of our model can be seen below, at Table 4.
Now all we have to do is to interpret this output.
Beginning with the intercept term, which corresponds to our β0. Taking the exponential of β0 we
have the mean odds to death of individuals in the
reference category. So, exp(β0) = exp(-2.121) = 0.12
is the chance of death among those individuals
that are older and received new treatment. A small
difference in the interpretation of coefficients appears when we go to the next coefficients. Individuals that also received new treatment but are
younger have a mean chance of death exp(β1) =
exp(0.454) = 1.58 times the chance of reference individuals. Similarly, older individuals that received
standard treatment have a mean chance exp(β2) =
exp(1.333) = 3.79 times the chance of reference individuals to die. But what if individuals are younger and received standard treatment? Then we have
to calculate exp(β1+β2) = exp(1.787) = 5.97 times
the mean chance of reference individuals.
This is the basics of logistic regression interpretation. However, some issues appear during the
analysis and solutions are not always readily available. In the next section we will discuss how to
deal with them.
Logistic regression pitfalls
Odds and probabilities
First it is imperative to understand that odds and
probabilities, although sometimes used as synonymous, are not the same. Probability is the ratio
between the number of events favorable to some
outcome and the total number of events. On the
other hand, odds are the ratio between probabilities: the probability of an event favorable to an
outcome and the probability of an event against

Logistic regression analysis
the same outcome. Probability is constrained between zero and one and odds are constrained between zero and infinity. And odds ratio is the ratio
between odds. The importance of this is that a
large odds ratio (OR) can represent a small probability and vice-versa. Let us go back to our example to make this point clear.
The reference group (older individuals receiving
new treatment) showed a chance of death approximately equal to 0.12. Using:
probability
it can be shown that the mean probability of death
of this group is 0.11. Knowing that the mean chance
of death in the group of younger individuals that
received new treatment is 1.58 greater than the
mean chance of the reference group, the chance
of death to this group can be estimated as 1.58 x
0.12 = 0.19 or, using Equation 3 above, a probability
of death equal to 0.16. Similarly, the mean chance
of death of an older individual receiving standard
treatment is 3.79 times the reference group, which
means a chance of death equal to 3.79 x 0.12 = 0.45
or a probability of death equals to 0.31. Finally,
younger individuals receiving standard treatment
have a chance of death equal to 5.97 x 0.11 = 0.72
or a probability of death equal to 0.42.
Therefore, as demonstrated, a large OR only means
that the chance of a particular group is much
greater than that of the reference group. But if the
chance of reference group is small, even a large OR
can still indicate a small probability.
Continuous explanatory variables or variables
with more than two levels
Now is time to think about what to do if explanatory variables are not binomial, as before. When an
explanatory variable is multinomial, then we must
build n-1 binary variables (called dummy variable)
to it, where n indicates the number of levels of the
variable. A dummy variable is just a variable that
will assume value one if subject presents the specified category and zero otherwise. For instance, a
variable named “satisfaction” that presents three
levels (“Low”, “Medium” and “High”) needs to be
represented by two dummy variables (x1 and x2) in
the model. The individuals at reference level, let’s
say “Low”, will present zeros in both dummy variables (Equation 4a), while individuals with “Medium” satisfaction will have a one in x1 and a zero in
x2 (Equation 4b). The opposite will occur with individuals with “High” satisfaction (Equation 4c). Usually, statistical software does it automatically and
the reader does not have to worry about it.
While interpretation of outputs from multinomial
explanatory variables is straightforward and follows the ones of binomial explanatory variables,
the interpretation of continuous variables, on the
other hand, is a bit more complex. The exp(β) of a
continuous variable represents the increment of
the chance of an event related to each unit increment on the explanatory variable. For instance,
the variable “Age” in our previous example, if instead of being binomial (older x younger) were
continuous, would produce the following result
(Table 5).
The first thing to point out is that the “Age2” coefficient (Age here taken as a continuous variable) is
now negative. It occurs because the older the individual (in years) the smaller the chance of death. If
we take exp(-0.294) = 0.75, it shows us that for
each year of life the chance to die of SA endocardilog
1 – π = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 = β10 + β20 = β0
1 – π = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 = β11 + β20 = β0 + β1
1 – π = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 = β10 + β21 = β0 + β2
“Medium” →

tis decreases by 25%. The intercept, now, represents individuals that received the new treatment
and with “zero years-old”. Take extra care when interpreting logistic regression results using continuous explanatory variables.
Variables inclusion and selection
A major problem when building a logistic model is
to select which variables to include. Researchers
usually collect as many variables as possible in
their research instrument, then put all of them into
the model and try to find something “significant”.
This approach increases the emergence of two situations. First, one or more variables are statistically
“significant”, but the researcher has no theory to
link the “significant” variable to the event of interest modeled. Remember that you are working
with samples and spurious results can occur. The
second situation is that a model with more variables presents less statistical power. So, if there is an
association between one explanatory variable and
the occurrence of an event, researcher can miss
this effect because saturated models (those that
contains all possible explanatory variables) are not
sensible enough to detect it. So the researcher
must to be very cautious with the selection of variables to include into the model.
We can start a regression using either a full (saturated) model, or a null (empty) model, which starts
only with the intercept term. In the first case, variables need to be dropped one by one, preferably
dropping the less significant one. This is the preferred strategy just because is easier to handle,
while the second requires all candidate variables
to be tested each step in a way to select the better
choice to include. On the other hand, if too many
variables are included at once in a full model, significant variables could be dropped due to low
statistical power, as mentioned above.
As a rule, if we have a large sample size, let’s say
that we have at least ten individuals per variable,
we can try to include all your explanatory variables
in the full model. However, if we have a limited
sample size in relation to the number of candidate
variables, a pre-selection should be performed instead. One way to do that is to test all variables
previously, using models with just one explanatory
variable at a time (univariate models) and afterwards include in the multivariate model all variables that have shown a relaxed P-value (for instance, P ≤ 0.25). There is no reason to worry about
a rigorous p-value criterion at this stage, because
this is just a pre-selection strategy and no inference will derive from this step. This relaxed P-value
criterion will allow reducing the initial number of
variables in the model reducing the risk of missing
important variables (4,5).
There is some debate about the appropriate strategy to variable selection (6) and the last is just another one. It is easy and intuitive. More elaborated
methods are available, but whatever the method,
it is very important that researchers get aware of
the procedure applied and not just press some
buttons on software.
Reference group setup
There are some explanatory variables for which
the reference level is almost automatically determined. For instance, to our response variable
named “Result” for which the outcomes are “died”
and “survived”, the reference level is almost always
set to “survived”, since the interest is focused on
variables associated with the outcome, death.

Logistic regression analysis
On the other hand, some variables have no clear
reference level, but present ordered levels and the
reference level will be, usually, one of the endpoints or, less frequently, the central level. This is
the case of variables assessed using Likert scales, a
psychometric scale commonly involved in research
that employs questionnaires (for instance, the degree of satisfaction about some product scaled as
“satisfied”, “nor satisfied, nor unsatisfied” or “unsatisfied”). However, some variables have no ordered levels and no clear reference level. This can
occur with geographic region. And then appears
the question: what region should I use as reference?
The answer is that there is no answer… However,
reference level selection can change the model estimation in some cases. It is important to remember that all results (and significant effects) presented are relative to the reference level. To make this
point clearer, let’s see an example. In a nationwide
survey about the occurrence of diabetic ketoacidosis, individual’s geographic region was found to
be significantly related to the probability of diabetic ketoacidosis at the onset of diabetes (7). In
this work, north/northeast region was set as reference and southeast region was the only one to be
statistically different relative to the reference. The
results, showing just the region variable, are below
(Table 6).
If we otherwise use Middle-East as the reference
level, the next result will emerge (again, only geographic region is shown) (Table 7).
Finally, if we use the southeast region as reference
level, we obtain following results (Table 8).

Logistic regression analysis
So, it is importance to pay attention to the setup of
the reference levels. If there is no apparent rule derived by the data itself or by the prior knowledge
about the variable values, one recommendation
that remains is to select a reference level with minimum sample size, to allow adequate statistical
power. Another recommendation that will make
interpretation easier is to choose categories with
the same relationship to the event of interest. If
you believe that older individuals have smaller
probability to die and people receiving new treatment are less probable to die, put these two categories as reference. You can use the opposite and
set younger individuals and standard treatment.
But choosing older individuals and standard treatment, although possible and not wrong, will difficult the interpretation of the results.
Conclusion
Logistic regression is a powerful tool, especially in
epidemiologic studies, allowing multiple explanatory variables being analyzed simultaneously,
meanwhile reducing the effect of confounding
factors. However, researchers must pay attention
to model building, avoiding just feeding software
with raw data and going forward to results. Some
difficult decisions on model building will depend
entirely on the expertise of researcher on the field.
