We solve a problem of non-convex stochastic optimisation with help of simulated annealing of L´evy
ﬂights of a variable stability index. The search of the ground state of an unknown potential is non-local
due to big jumps of the Levy ﬂights process.
The convergence to the ground state is fast due to a
polynomial decrease rate of the temperature.

Introduction
Let U be a potential function in Rd having several local minima and increasing fast at inﬁnity. We look for
a global minimum of U. Classical continuous-time simulated annealing (Boltzmann machine) (see [VG84,
Gid, GH86, GM93]) consists in running a diﬀusion process
ˆZ0,z(t) = z −
∇U( ˆZ0,z(u)) du +
ˆσ(u)dW(u),
where W is a standard Brownian motion, θ > 0 denotes the cooling rate and λ > 1 parametrises the initial
temperature, which equals
θ/ ln(λ) at time t = 0. It is known that there is a critical value ˆθ such that
the diﬀusion ˆZ(t) converges in distribution to the global minimum of U if θ > ˆθ, and the convergence fails
otherwise. Moreover, the critical value ˆθ is the logarithmic rate of the principal non-zero eigenvalue λ1(σ)
of a time homogeneous diﬀusion generator Aσf = σ2
2 ∆f −⟨∇U, f⟩, i.e.
σ→0 σ2 ln |λ1(σ)|.
The value of ˆθ can be calculated explicitly, if one knows the heights of potential barriers between diﬀerent
wells of U (see [Wen72a, Wen72b] and [KM96] for precise results). Rigorous results on optimal cooling rate
in simulated annealing algorithms can be found in [Haj88, CHS87, HKS89, HS90].
In order to accelerate the search, Szu and Hartley in [SH87] suggested the so-called fast simulated annealing (Cauchy machine), which is a combination of a classical Metropolis algorithm introduced in [MRRT53]
and a concept of non-local search due to the heavy-tail Cauchy visiting distribution. The authors claimed
that in the Cauchy machine the temperature can be chosen decreasing as a power of time, namely σ(t) ∼t−1,
and applied the algorithm in image processing, see [Szu93].
Motivated by [SH87], in our papers [Pav06b, Pav06a] we considered a continuous-time counterpart of
the process ˆZ driven by L´evy ﬂights of stability index α ∈(0, 2), and temperature σ(t) ∼t−θ, θ > 0. We
discovered that such a jump process never settles in the neighbourhood of a global minimum, but can be
used to reveal a spatial structure of the potential U. The dynamics of L´evy ﬂights with constant small noise
was studied in our previous papers [IP06a, IP06b, IP06c].
∗Correspondence should be addressed to 
In the present paper we solve the problem of global optimisation with help of state-dependent L´evy ﬂights
in a multi-well potential U. We show, that in certain annealing regimes, the global minimum is localised
always, as in the classical Gaussian case. For simplicity, we restrict our theoretical argument in Sections 2–
5 to one-dimensional potentials. However, it will be clear from the presentation, that the algorithm also
works in a multi-dimensional setting. In our numerical example in Section 6 we consider a two-dimensional
potential with ﬁve wells.
Results on the cooled down L´evy ﬂights
In [Pav06b, Pav06a] we considered a one-dimensional L´evy ﬂights process in an external potential U determined by the equation
0,z (t) = z −
0,z (u−)) du +
(λ + u)θ .
We understand a L´evy ﬂights process L(α) as a symmetric stable L´evy process with stability index α ∈(0, 2),
whose marginal distributions have the Fourier transform
EeiωL(α)(t) = e−c(α)t|ω|α = exp
eiωy −1 −iωyID(y)
where ID(y) is the indicator function of the unit disk D = {y : |y| ≤1}, and c(α) = 2| cos
Γ(−α)|. We
choose such a parametrisation in order to have a simple form of a L´evy measure ν(dy) = |y|−1−αdy.
The measure ν is also called a jump measure of the process L´evy L(α). It controls the intensity and sizes
of its jumps. Indeed, let ∆L(α)(t) = L(α)(t) −L(α)(t−) denote the jump size of L(α) at time instance t > 0.
Then the number of jumps on the time interval (0, t] with values in a set J ⊆R is a Poissonian random
variable with the mean tν(J) (which can be possibly zero or inﬁnite).
The process L(α) is a Markov process with a non-local generator
[f(x + y) −f(x) −yf ′(x)ID(y)]
which is also referred to as a fractional Laplacian, A = ∆α/2.
We direct reader’s attention to the books [Sat99, App04, Pro04] on a rigorous mathematical theory
of L´evy processes and stochastic diﬀerential equations. Physical results on the subject can be found in
[MK04, CGK+04, BS02].
We assume that the potential U has n local minima mi and n −1 local maxima si such that −∞= s0 <
m1 < s1 < · · · < mn < sn+1 = +∞. The extrema are non-degenerate, i.e. U ′′(mi) > 0 and U ′′(si) < 0.
Moreover we demand that |U ′(x)| > |x|1+c as |x| →+∞for some positive c.
In the small temperature limit, i.e. when λ →+∞or t →+∞, the process Z(α) can be seen as a random
perturbation of a deterministic dynamical system
x(t) = x −
We denote Ωi = (si−1, si), 1 ≤i ≤n, the domains of attraction of the stable points mi.
The positive parameter θ is called the cooling rate, and λ > 0 determines the initial temperature of the
system which equals to λ−θ at t = 0.
Equation (2.1) describes a non-linear dynamics of a L´evy particle, whose temperature is being decreased
at a polynomial rate as t →∞.
In [Pav06b, Pav06a], we discovered two cooling regimes — slow cooling θ < 1/α and fast cooling θ > 1/α
— in which the transitions of a particle between the wells of U have diﬀerent asymptotic properties.
Let ∆> 0 be a small number, and let Bi = {y : |y −mi| ≤∆} denote a ∆-neighbourhood of a local
minimum mi. Consider transition times
s,z = inf{u ≥s : Z(α)
s,z (u) ∈∪j̸=iBj}
between diﬀerent neighbourhoods Bi and the corresponding transition probabilities Ps,z(Z(α)(T i,λ) ∈Bj),
i ̸= j. Then for θ < 1/α and z ∈Bi we have
P0,z(Z(α)(T i) ∈Bj) →q(α)
|mi −y|1+α = 1
|sj−1 −mi|α −
|mi −y|1+α =
|si−1 −mi|α +
We have also shown that in the limit t →+∞, Z(α)
0,z (t) has a distribution
π(α)(dy) =
where the vector π(α) = (π(α)
, . . . , π(α)
n )T , solves the equation QT π(α) = 0, Q = (q(α)
i,j=1, q(α)
is clearly seen, that all π(α)
> 0, and Z(α) does not settle down near the global minimum of U. However,
the values π(α)
, which can be estimated from the Monte Carlo simulations, reveal the spatial structure of U,
e.g. the sizes of the domains Ωi.
If the cooling rate θ is above the threshold 1/α, the L´evy particle Z(α) gets trapped in one of the wells
and thus the convergence fails. Consider the ﬁrst exit time from the i-th well
s,z = inf{u ≥s : Z(α)
s,z /∈Ωi}.
Then, for z ∈Bi, 1 ≤i ≤n,
P0,z(Si < ∞) = O
and consequently, E0,zSi = ∞.
L´evy ﬂights with variable stability index (stable-like processes)
In order to take into account the energy geometry of the potential, we have to make the L´evy ﬂights process
depend on its current position. Thus instead of L´evy ﬂights L(α) deﬁned in (2.2), we consider now the
so-called stable-like process H = (H(t))t≥0, which is a Markov process deﬁned by the non-local generator
[f(x + y) −f(x) −yf ′(x)ID(y)]
|y|1+α(x) ,
with a function α(x) taking values in the interval (0, 2). Sometimes, the notation B = ∆α(·)/2 is used.
The main diﬀerence between L(α) and H consists in a dependence of a stable-like jump measure νx(dy) =
|y|−1−α(x) on the spatial coordinate x. Thus, if H(t0) = x0, the instant jump distribution of H at time t0 is
governed by a stable measure νx0(dy).
Of course, the dynamics of H is completely determined by a variable stability index α(x). For example,
if α(x) = α0 ∈(0, 2), then H is just a usual L´evy ﬂights process of index α0. From now on, we assume that
α(x) takes values strictly between 0 and 2, i.e. 0 < a ≤α(x) ≤A < 2, to exclude degeneration of the jump
We are going to study the dynamics of a stochastic diﬀerential equation with the driving process H,
Y0,y(t) = y −
U ′(Y0,y(u−)) du +
dH(Y0,y(u−), u)
For a better understanding of the process Y , it is instructive to consider a discrete time analogue of (3.2)
given by the recurrent formula
yk = yk−1 −U ′(yk−1)h +
(λ + (k −1)h)θ ,
The discrete time dynamical system (3.3) is obtained from the Euler approximation of (3.2) with the time
step h, and can be used for simulations. (However, one should be careful when U ′ is not globally Lipschits.)
The random input is determined by the random variables ξk(y) such that
d= L(α(y))(h)
d= h1/α(y)L(α(y))(1)
where L(α(y))(1) has a standard symmetric α(y)-stable distribution with the Fourier transform (2.2).
One-well dynamics. Transitions and trapping
The dynamics Y of the L´evy ﬂights with variable stability index in the force ﬁeld U ′ is a result of an interplay
of two independent eﬀects. First, for small temperatures, i.e. when λ →+∞or t →+∞, Y is close to the
underlying deterministic trajectory X0. Starting from any point of Ωi, it follows X0 with the same initial
point and with high probability reaches a small neighbourhood of mi in relatively short time. On the other
hand, Y tries to deviate from X0 making jumps controlled by the jump measure νx(dy). Finally, if Y is in
the well Ωi, it spends most of the time in a neighbourhood of mi and thus has jumps approximately governed
by the stable jump measure νmi(dy) = |y|−1−α(mi)dy.
Thus, the exit time and the exit probability from the well Ωi of the process Y are approximately the same
as for the process Z(α(mi)). This resemblance becomes exact if we consider a piece-wise constant stability
index α(x), α(x) = Pn
i=1 αiI{x ∈Ωi}, 0 < αi < 2. With this choice of α(x), the process Y is just driven by
the equation (2.1) until it exits the well. (We omit a discussion on the behaviour of the process in the small
neighbourhoods of the saddle points.)
Let us introduce the following transition and exit times for the process Y :
s,z = inf{u ≥s : Ys,z(u) ∈∪j̸=iBj},
s,z = inf{u ≥s : Ys,z /∈Ωi}.
It follows from (2.6) and (2.7), that if y ∈Bi and α(mi)θ < 1, then the following relations hold as λ →+∞:
λα(mi)θ →[q(α(mi))
P0,z(Y (T i) ∈Bj) →q(α(mi))
On the other hand, if α(mi)θ > 1, the L´evy particle gets trapped in the well due to (2.11), i.e.
P0,z(σi < ∞) = O
and consequently, E0,zσi,λ = ∞.
Relations (4.3), (4.4) and (4.5) are crucial for our analysis.
Non-local random search and simulated annealing
Getting trapped in an assigned well
We demonstrate now how to drive the L´evy particle Y to an assigned well Ωi, if the approximate location
of its minimum mi is known.
Indeed, the function α(x) given, the global dynamics of Y is determined by the values α(mi), 1 ≤i ≤n,
and the cooling rate θ. Moreover, for our analysis we can freely choose both α(x) and θ.
Let α(x) be smooth and attain its unique global maximum at mi. Then we have
α(mi) > max
j̸=i α(mj).
For instance, one can take α(x) = (A −a)/(1 + (x −mi)2) + a for some 0 < a < A < 2. Then we can choose
θ > 0, such that
α(mi)θ > 1,
α(mj)θ < 1 for j ̸= i.
With this choice of parameters, as t →+∞, the particle leaves any well Ωj, j ̸= i, in a ﬁnite time according
to (4.3). Moreover, since all transition probabilities in (4.4) are strictly positive, the probability to enter the
well Ωi after a ﬁnite number of transitions between the wells Ωj, j ̸= i, equals 1. Finally, upon entering Ωi,
the particle gets trapped there due to (4.5).
Looking for the global minimum
Let M be the (unique) unknown global minimum of the potential U. To make a L´evy particle settle near it,
we have to determine the appropriate variable stability index α(x) and the cooling rate θ such that
α(M)θ > 1,
α(mi)θ < 1, mi ̸= M.
Let ϕ(u) be an arbitrary smooth monotone decreasing function on R, 0 < a < ϕ(u) < A < 2. Then we set
α(y) = ϕ(U(y)).
It is clear that
α(M) > α(mi)
for all mi ̸= M,
and we choose θ to satisfy relations (5.3). The trapping of the particle near the global minimum M follows
from the argument of the preceding section.
The local minimum with maximal energy
Analogously, we can determine the coordinate of the (unique) ‘highest’ local minimum m, i.e. such that
U(m) = max
1≤i≤n U(mi).
In this case, we should take α(y) = ψ(U(y)) with an arbitrary smooth monotone increasing function ψ,
0 < a < ϕ(y) < A < 2, which leads to the inequality
α(m) > α(mi)
for all mi ̸= m,
and the arguments of the previous sections justify the success of the search.
A local minimum with certain energy
Finally, we can perform a search not for the global minimum of U but for a local minimum mE satisfying
the condition U(mE) ≤E for some energy level E. In such a case we take a piece-wise constant stability
0 < a < A < 2,
and a cooling rate θ satisfying conditions Aθ > 1 and aθ < 1. Consequently, if for some i, the minimum
U(mi) lies below the threshold E, then near this minimum Y behaves like a jump-diﬀusion Z(A) driven
by a L´evy ﬂights process L(A), and thus the L´evy particle gets trapped due to (4.5). If the well minimum
lies above the level E, a L´evy particle behaves like a process Z(a) and leaves this well in ﬁnite time due to
relations (4.3) and (4.4).
If there are several wells with minima below E, the L´evy particle settles down near one of them.
Running the search for decreasing energies E1 > E2 > ..., we can also estimate the ground energy level
E∗= U(M) and to determine the global minimum M. Analogously, one can determine a local minimum
mE satisfying conditions U(mE) ≥E or E1 ≤U(mE) ≤E2.
We emphasise that the search algorithm described in this section requires no particular information about
the potential U: to determine the local minimum mE we use three numbers a, A and θ, the energy level E,
and values of U ′(x).
Numerical example
In the preceding sections we gave a theoretic justiﬁcation of the search algorithm in dimension one. It is
clear that a d-dimensional case, d > 1, does not diﬀer much. It suﬃces to consider isotropic (spherically
symmetric) d-dimensional L´evy ﬂights with a jumping measure νx(dy) = |y|−d−α(x)dy, and to calculate new
values of transition probabilities in (2.8) writing d instead of 1 in the integrals.
Similarly to (3.3), we generate a d-dimensional Markov chain
yk = yk−1 −∇U(yk−1)h +
(λ + (k −1)h)θ ,
with some initial value y0. Isotropic α-stable random vectors ξh
k(y) are obtained as marginals of a subordinated standard d-dimensional Brownian motion (e.g., see Examples 24.12 and 30.6 in [Sat99]). More
precisely, let S be an α/2-stable strictly positive random variable with the Fourier transform
E exp(iωS) = exp
−|ω|α/2(1 −i sgn(ω) tan(πα
and the Laplace transform
E exp(−uS) = exp
Let W be a standard Gaussian vector independent of S with a characteristic function
E exp (i⟨ω, W⟩) = exp
Then one obtains a standard isotropic d-dimensional α-stable random vector L(α) with the Fourier transform
i⟨ω, L(α)⟩
ei(ω,y) −1 −i(ω, y)ID(y)
L(α) d= c(α, d)
Finally the random increments in (6.1) can be calculated as
k(y) = h1/α(y)L(α(y)).
Five-well potential in R2
To illustrate the eﬃciency of the method, we consider a two-dimensional potential function U given by the
1 + 0.05(y2
1 + (y2 −10)2) −
1 + 0.05((y1 −10)2 + y2
1 + 0.03((y1 + 10)2 + y2
1 + 0.05((y1 −5)2 + (y2 + 10)2) −
1 + 0.1((y1 + 5)2 + (y2 + 10)2)
(1 + 0.0001(y2
Figure 1: A typical random search path (yk)0≤k≤n of a L´evy particle (l.) and the values of the potential
function U(yk) (r.). Thick lines on the left ﬁgure denote the boundaries of the attraction domains Ωi of the
stable points mi, i = 1, . . . , 5.
The function U has ﬁve local minima mi, i = 1, . . . , 5, with the following coordinates and energy values:
m1 ≈(−9.73, −0.11),
U(m1) ≈−0.85,
m2 ≈(−0.09,
U(m2) ≈−0.44,
m3 ≈( 9.59, −0.37),
U(m3) ≈−0.54,
m4 ≈( 4.92, −9.89),
U(m4) ≈−1.46,
m5 ≈(−4.79, −9.79),
U(m5) ≈−0.79.
We perform a search for a local minimum mE having the energy less than E = −1, i.e. such that U(mE) ≤
−1. In our example, mE = m4. According to Section 5.4, we choose a piece-wise constant stability index
1.8, if U(y) < −1,
1.1, if U(y) ≥−1,
and θ = 0.75.
We perform 100 simulations of the Markov chain (6.1) for n = 2 · 106, initial conditions y0 distributed
uniformly in the square [−20, 20]2, the initial temperature λ = 104, and the time step h = 0.1. The global
minimum m4 was determined in 96 cases (U(yn) = −1.46). The local minimum m3 was located twice, and
each of the minima m1 and m2 once. A typical random path (yk)0≤k≤n on the plain and the corresponding
values of the energy function U(yk) are shown on Figure 1.
We emphasise, that in our simulations we used only values of the potential U without any additional
information about its geometry.
Conclusion and discussion
In this paper we presented a new stochastic algorithm for global optimisation. It allows to determine a global
minimum of an unknown potential U with help of simulated annealing of non-Gaussian jump-diﬀusions driven
by the so-called stable-like processes, or L´evy ﬂights with a variable stability index α(x). We have shown
that choosing α(x) in an appropriate way, we can force the L´evy particle to settle in a neighbourhood of
the global maximum of U. We note, that the non-constant behaviour of the stability index is crucial for
the success of the search, and a similar algorithm with usual spatially homogeneous L´evy ﬂights, i.e. when
α(x) = α0, leads to quite diﬀerent results, see [Pav06a].
Our method has the following advantages in comparison with the Gaussian simulated annealing considered
in the introduction. First, the search of the global minimum is non-local, i.e. when the annealed process
leaves a potential well, it does not necessarily pass to one of the neighbouring wells, but with strictly positive
probability can jump to any well. Moreover, the probability to jump into the deepest well is maximal, if
this well is also spatially the biggest, which is observed in typical potential landscapes, see [Sch97]. We do
not expect that our algorithm would eﬀectively detect the so-called ‘golf-hole’ wells. Mean transition times
between the wells increase as a power of the large parameter λ or, equivalently, the current time t. We can
easily obtain theoretic estimates for a number of transitions between the wells before settling in the deepest
well. These estimates follow from the analysis of a discrete time Markov chain with transition probabilities
pij = q(α(mi))
]−1, pii = 0.
Second, we have more freedom to choose the parameters of the system. Indeed, if the values of U(mi)
are not known, there is no method which helps to determine the cooling rate θ. (One has the same problem
to determine ˆθ in (1.2) in Gaussian case.) However, in our algorithm, θ is chosen together with a variable
stability index α(x).
Third, our method allows to drive the L´evy particle into any well whose location is approximately known.
We can also determine a local minimum with energy below the certain given value. The choice of parameters
in these regimes is independent of the geometry of the potential. Such search regimes are not possible in the
classical setting.
Finally, the temperature decreases polynomially fast in time, i.e. ∼t−θ, and not logarithmic.
signiﬁcantly increases the accuracy of empirical estimates for the local minima locations.
Although the theoretic basis for the success of the search is established, many questions are still open.
For example, we have to understand how to choose the optimal pair α(x) and θ, which minimises the search
time. Indeed, if mi is not a global minimum, we can reduce the life time of the particle in the neighbourhood
of mi making α(mi) small. On the other hand, in this case, the process Y will tend to make very big jumps,
and thus jump out to one of the peripheral wells. As a consequence, the search would be slow, if the global
minimum of U is attained in one of the inner wells. Thus, the value of α(mi) should not be very small to
exclude very big jumps, and should be well separated from α(M) to block trapping in the false well. The
problem of very big jumps can be also avoided by consideration of truncated L´evy ﬂights with maximal jump
size not exceeding the size of the search domain. However, in this case the simulation of random input can
be more complicated. We shall address these and other questions in our further research.
