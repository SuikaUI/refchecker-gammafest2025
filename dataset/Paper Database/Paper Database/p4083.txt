The retrieval of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from four Neandertal fossils from Germany, Russia, and Croatia
has demonstrated that these individuals carried closely related mtDNAs that are not found among current humans.
However, these results do not definitively resolve the question of a possible Neandertal contribution to the gene pool
of modern humans since such a contribution might have been erased by genetic drift or by the continuous influx of
modern human DNA into the Neandertal gene pool. A further concern is that if some Neandertals carried mtDNA
sequences similar to contemporaneous humans, such sequences may be erroneously regarded as modern
contaminations when retrieved from fossils. Here we address these issues by the analysis of 24 Neandertal and 40
early modern human remains. The biomolecular preservation of four Neandertals and of five early modern humans
was good enough to suggest the preservation of DNA. All four Neandertals yielded mtDNA sequences similar to those
previously determined from Neandertal individuals, whereas none of the five early modern humans contained such
mtDNA sequences. In combination with current mtDNA data, this excludes any large genetic contribution by
Neandertals to early modern humans, but does not rule out the possibility of a smaller contribution.
Introduction
Despite intense research efforts, no consensus has been
reached about the genetic relationship between early modern
humans and archaic human forms such as the Neandertals.
While supporters of ‘‘multiregional evolution’’ argue for
genetic exchange or even continuity between archaic and
modern humans ,
proponents of a ‘‘single African origin’’ of contemporary
humans claim that negligible genetic interaction took place
 . Mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) sequences from early modern humans would
in principle be able to resolve the question of a contribution
of Neandertal mtDNA to modern humans. However, human
DNA is pervasive in palaeontological and archaeological
remains as well as in most laboratory environments . It is therefore currently impossible to differentiate
contaminating modern DNA sequences from endogenous
human DNA in human remains. Thus, although mtDNA
sequences have been reported from remains of early modern
humans , it is not
possible to determine whether such DNA sequences indeed
represent endogenous DNA sequences . A
related problem is that if a Neandertal fossil yields modern
human-like DNA sequences, those might be discarded as
putative contaminations ,
even if they may be endogenous and represent evidence for a
close genetic relationship or interbreeding between the two
To explore the genetic relationship between early modern
humans and Neandertals in spite of these difﬁculties, we
made use of the fact that the four Neandertal mtDNA
sequences determined to date can easily be distinguished
from those of modern humans .
This allowed us to ask whether all well-preserved Neandertal
remains contain Neandertal-like mtDNA and whether all
well-preserved early modern human remains fail to contain
such DNA sequences. Thus, we did not attempt to determine
DNA sequences that are similar to present-day human
mtDNA. Instead, we determined whether Neandertal-like
mtDNA sequences were present or absent in well-preserved
remains of Neandertals and of early modern humans.
Results and Discussion
The preservation of endogenous DNA in fossils is correlated with the amount, composition, and chemical preservation of amino acids . We ﬁnd that
endogenous DNA can be ampliﬁed from Pleistocene remains
when the amino acid content is more than 30,000 parts per
million (ppm), the ratio of glycine to aspartic acid between
two and ten, and the aspartic acid racemization (i.e., the
stereoisomeric D/L ratio) less than 0.10 .
We analyzed the amino acid preservation of 24 Neandertal
and 40 early modern human fossils (Table S1). Several
important Neandertal fossils, such as La Ferrassie and
Krapina, as well as important modern human fossils, such
as Veternica, proved to be too poorly preserved to be likely to
allow DNA retrieval. Thus, further destructive sampling of
these specimens was not considered justiﬁed. However, four
Neandertal and ﬁve early modern human fossils fulﬁlled the
above criteria for amino acid preservation and were thus
expected to contain endogenous DNA (Figure 1; Table 1).
These samples were geographically well distributed across
Europe (Figure 2) and included remains whose morphology is
typical of Neandertals (e.g., La Chapelle-aux-Saints) and of
modern humans (La Madeleine, Cro-Magnon). They also
included samples that have sometimes been considered
‘‘transitional’’ between Neandertals and modern humans,
based on their morphological features: Vindija 
and Mladecˇ .
If low amounts of DNA are preserved in a specimen, some
extracts will fail to contain DNA molecules by chance
 . Therefore, except in the case of
2, in which the amount of material available
permitted only two extractions, we extracted each of the
four Neandertal and the ﬁve early modern human samples
three times. For each extraction, ampliﬁcations were performed using two primer pairs: (i) ‘‘hominoid primers’’ that
amplify homologous mtDNA sequences from the previously
determined Neandertals and contemporary modern humans,
as well as African great apes; (ii) ‘‘Neandertal primers’’ that,
under the conditions used, amplify only Neandertal mtDNAs
even in the presence of a large excess of modern human DNA
 . Since authentic
ancient DNA is typically highly degraded, both primer pairs
were designed to amplify short mtDNA fragments (72 and 31
bp, respectively, excluding primers). In each of these fragments, two substitutions allow the discrimination of previously determined Neandertal mtDNA sequences from
contemporary modern human sequences. The sensitivity of
both primer pairs is similar, as shown by the fact that they are
both able to amplify single template molecules as judged from
nucleotide misincorporation patterns .
In order to determine the nature of the DNA sequences
ampliﬁed, each ampliﬁcation product was cloned and
approximately 30 clones were sequenced for each ‘‘hominoid
product’’ and ten clones for each ‘‘Neandertal product.’’
When ampliﬁed with the hominoid primers, all Neandertal
and all early modern human remains yielded modern human
DNA sequences (see Table 1). In addition, ﬁve cave bear teeth
from Vindija, Croatia, and one from Gamssulzen, Austria,
extracted in parallel with the hominid samples, all yielded
human sequences. This conﬁrms previous results in showing
that most, if not all, ancient remains yield human DNA
sequences when ampliﬁcation conditions that allow single
DNA molecules to be detected are used . For three Neandertal and all ﬁve modern human
remains, several different mtDNA sequences were retrieved
from individual extractions, and in the case of one
Neandertal and one modern human, at least two of the
sequences were also found in an independent extraction from
the same specimen. Additionally, one of the cave bear teeth
yielded a human sequence found in two independent
extracts. Thus, the fact that a DNA sequence is found in
two independent extracts is a necessary, but not sufﬁcient,
criterion of authenticity when human remains are analyzed.
This implies that in the absence of further technical
improvements, it is impossible to produce undisputable
human mtDNA sequences from ancient human remains. In
addition to DNA sequences identical to those previously
ampliﬁed from present-day humans, the Neandertal bones
Vi-77 and Vi-80 from Vindija yielded four out of 89 and 73

No Evidence of Neandertal Contribution
out of 85 mtDNA sequences, respectively, that were identical
to previously determined Neandertal sequences. Thus, these
two specimens contain a proportion of Neandertal-like
mtDNA sequences (i.e., sequences that carry two substitutions
that differentiate Neandertal mtDNA sequences from modern human mtDNA sequences as described above) that is high
enough to detect using primers that amplify also modern
human DNA.
When ampliﬁed with Neandertal-speciﬁc primers, Neandertal-like mtDNA sequences were ampliﬁed from two
independent extractions from all Neandertal fossils (see
Table 1; Figure 3). For one of these, Vi-80 from Vindija,
DNA preservation was sufﬁcient to allow the retrieval of
longer fragments and thus the reconstruction of 357 bp of the
hypervariable region I (see Supporting Information section;
Figure S1). This mtDNA sequence was identical to that
retrieved from another bone from the same locality . In contrast to the Neandertal remains,
none of the early modern human extracts yielded any
ampliﬁcation products with the Neandertal primers, although
these remains are similar in chemical preservation to the
Neandertal remains (see Figure 1).
Thus, all Neandertal remains analyzed yielded mtDNA
sequences that are not found in the human mtDNA gene pool
today but are similar to those found in four previously
published Neandertals (see Figure 3). This is
compatible with results suggesting that the extent of
Neandertal mtDNA diversity was similar to that of current
humans and lower than that of the great apes . It is noteworthy that this result is
not an artifact created by discarding ‘‘modern-like’’ mtDNA
sequences ampliﬁed from Neandertals , since
all Neandertal remains with good biomolecular preservation
yield ‘‘Neandertal-like’’ mtDNA sequence. Furthermore, none
of the ﬁve early modern humans yields ‘‘Neandertal-like’’
mtDNA sequences in spite of the fact that these remains are
as well preserved in terms of amino acids as the Neandertal
remains. Thus, we fail to detect any evidence of mtDNA gene
ﬂow from Neandertals to early modern humans or from early
modern humans to Neandertals.
However, a relevant question is what extent of gene ﬂow
between Neandertals and early modern humans the current
data allow us to exclude. In this regard, it is of relevance that
the ﬁve early modern humans analyzed lived much closer in
time to the Neandertals than do contemporary individuals.
The probability that mtDNA sequences potentially contributed to modern humans by Neandertals were lost by drift
 or swamped by continuous inﬂux of modern
human mtDNAs in the Neandertal gene
pool is therefore much smaller than when contemporary
humans are analyzed . In fact, the ﬁve
early modern humans analyzed almost double the amount of
information about the Upper Pleistocene mtDNA gene pool
since, under a model of constant effective population size, all
contemporary humans trace their mtDNA ancestors back to
only four to seven mtDNA lineages 20,000 to 30,000 years ago
(Figure 4A; Figure S2), while all other mtDNA sequences
present in the gene pool at that time have been lost by
random genetic drift. Since the probability is very low (p ,
0.007) that one or more of the ﬁve early modern humans
analyzed here are among these few ancestors of current
humans, the ﬁve Upper Pleistocene individuals can be added
to the ancestors of the current mtDNA gene pool to allow us
to ask what extent of Neandertal mtDNA contribution to
early modern humans can be statistically excluded using the
coalescent. Under the model of a constant human effective
population size of 10,000 over
time (Figure 4A), any contribution of Neandertal mtDNA to
modern humans 30,000 years ago larger than 25% can be
excluded at the 5% level (Figure S3). A more realistic scenario
may be that the spread of modern humans was accompanied
by an increase in population size before and during their
migration out of Africa and subsequent colonization of
western Eurasia (see Figure 4B). In that case, the Neandertal
contribution that can be excluded is smaller (i.e., less gene
ﬂow could have taken place), but that depends critically on

No Evidence of Neandertal Contribution
when and how the expansion occurred. Finally, under the
unlikely scenario that population size was constant during the
migration out of Africa and colonization of Europe and
expanded only after a putative merging with Neandertals, the
Neandertal contribution could have been larger, but this also
depends on the nature of the growth (see Figure 4C).
Concluding Remarks
It is noteworthy that under the model of constant
population size, about 50 early modern human remains
would need to be studied to exclude a Neandertal mtDNA
contribution of 10%. To exclude a 5% contribution, one
would need to study more early modern human remains than
have been discovered to date. Thus, deﬁnitive knowledge of
the extent of a putative contribution of Neandertals to the
modern human gene pool will not be possible, although
extensive studies of variation in the current human gene pool
may clarify this question . It is, however,
worthwhile to note that samples considered as anatomically
‘‘transitional’’ between modern humans and Neandertals,
such as Vindija and Mladecˇ
 , analyzed here, fail to show
any evidence of mtDNA admixture between the two groups.
Thus, while it cannot be excluded that Neandertals contributed variants at some genetic loci to contemporary
humans, no positive evidence of any such contribution has
yet been detected.
Materials and Methods
Amino acid preservation. About 10 mg of bone were removed from
each specimen and analyzed as in Schmitz et al. with minor
modiﬁcations. In brief, proteins are hydrolyzed and amino acids
labeled with o-phtaldialdehyde/N-acetyl-L-cysteine and analyzed by
high performance liquid chromatography (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan)
under conditions that separate the different amino acids as well as
their stereoisomers. Eight amino acids are analyzed and their
respective concentration measured: D- and L-alanine, glycine, Dand L-aspartic acid, serine, glutamic acid, valine, D- and L-leucine,
and isoleucine.
DNA extraction and ampliﬁcation. DNA extractions were performed in a laboratory dedicated to ancient DNA work. In this
laboratory, positive air pressure is maintained with ﬁltered air at all
times, and all areas and equipment are treated with UV light when
the laboratory is not used. A maximum of six bone or teeth samples
were processed together with two blank extractions. Neandertal
samples were always processed together with early modern human
samples or cave bear samples. For each extraction, the samples were
ground and between 30 mg and 120 mg of bone powder was extracted
as in Krings et al. . mtDNA sequences were ampliﬁed by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 5 ll of extract and 60 cycles.
In addition, a minimum of four blank PCRs were performed together
with each ampliﬁcation from extracts. The ‘‘Neandertal-speciﬁc’’
ampliﬁcation was carried out using the primers NL16230/NH16262
 and an annealing temperature of 608C. We
consider it highly unlikely that the Neandertal-speciﬁc mtDNA
fragments represent contaminations from other Neandertals, given
that none of the extracts of modern humans or cave bears processed
in parallel with the Neandertal remains yielded such products. The
‘‘hominoid’’ ampliﬁcation was performed with the primers L16022/
H16095 and an annealing temperature of 548C.
PCR products were cloned into Escherichia coli using the TOPO TA
cloning kit (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands), and ten or 30 clones
of each ampliﬁcation were sequenced on a ABI 3700 (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States).
Estimation of admixture. Given that previous analyses of mtDNA
sequences have rejected a model of complete panmixia between
Neandertals and early modern humans , we focused
on the estimation of the level of admixture between Neandertals and
early modern humans that can be excluded. For this purpose, we
considered a population of early modern humans that merged at Tm
with a (genetically different) population of Neandertal individuals
(see Figure 4) from which point the fused population was panmictic.
The probability of picking K individuals by chance in the merged
population that all carry a modern human mtDNA sequence is (1 
c)K, where c represents the Neandertal genetic contribution to the
merged population. If none of n mtDNA sequences sampled in the
merged population is Neandertal-like, we can exclude (at the 5%
level) contributions that give a probability smaller than 0.05 of
observing only modern human sequences, i.e., (1  c)K , 0.05. The
number of ancestors of n samples at the time t is represented by a
probability distribution, An(t). Thus, the probability of observing only
one kind of sequences in n samples becomes:
Pr(only human sequences observed) ¼ RðPrðAnðtÞ ¼ KÞ 3ð1  cÞKÞ;
where K vary from 1 to n. For a population of constant size over time,
Pr(An(t) = K) has been derived in Tavare . We estimated the
number of ancestors of n samples at time t as the expected value of
An(t), E(An(t)), according to this model and calculate the probability
of observing only human sequences for different values of c.

(A) Under the assumption of a constant
effective population size of 10,000 for
modern humans, contemporary mtDNAs
trace back to approximately ﬁve mtDNA
lineages 25,000 years ago. The modern
human fossils represent ﬁve additional
samples from around the time of putative admixture (stars). The contemporary

reject a Neandertal contribution of 25%
or more to modern humans about 30,000

an expansion of the human population

individual Vi-75 from Vindija . We could exclude
cross-contamination from the old extract to this bone because
different primers were used and some of the fragments of mtDNA
ampliﬁed from Vi-80 were longer than those used to determine the
sequence of Vi-75. Morphological analyses do not exclude that these
two fragmentary bones (Vi-75 and Vi-80) may come from a single
individual. Carbon-14 accelerator mass spectrometry dating, conducted in the A˚ ngstrom Laboratory (Uppsala University, Sweden),
yielded a date for Vi-80 of 38,310 6 2,130 BP (before present). Since
Vi-75 has been previously dated to over 42,000 BP ,
the possibility exists that the dates overlap since 42,000 BP is within
two standard deviations of the Vi-80 date. Therefore, the bone
labeled Vi-80 that yields the new mtDNA sequence could either be (i)
a fragment of the same skeleton (individual) that was already
successfully extracted, (ii) a bone from another individual maternally
related to the ﬁrst individual ampliﬁed, or (iii) another unrelated
individual having by chance the same mtDNA sequence, which is not
unlikely given the apparently low mtDNA diversity of Neandertals
 .
