This volume is intended as an essentially self contained exposition of portions of the
theory of second order quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations, with
emphasis on the Dirichlet problem in bounded domains. It grew out of lecture
notes for graduate courses by the authors at Stanford University, the final material
extending well beyond the scope of these courses. By including preparatory
chapters on topics such as potential theory and functional analysis, we have
attempted to make the work accessible to a broad spectrum of readers. Above all,
we hope the readers of this book will gain an appreciation of the multitude of
ingenious barehanded techniques that have been developed in the study of elliptic
equations and have become part of the repertoire of analysis.
Many individuals have assisted us during the evolution of this work over the
past several years. In particular, we are grateful for the valuable discussions
with L. M. Simon and his contributions in Sections 15.4 to 15.8; for the helpful
comments and corrections of J. M. Cross, A. S. Geue, J. Nash, P. Trudinger and
B. Turkington; for the contributions of G. Williams in Section 10.5 and of A. S.
Geue in Section 10.6; and for the impeccably typed manuscript which resulted
from the dedicated efforts oflsolde Field at Stanford and Anna Zalucki at Canberra.
The research of the authors connected with this volume was supported in part by
the National Science Foundation.
