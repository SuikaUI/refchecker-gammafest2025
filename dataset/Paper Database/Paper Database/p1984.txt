ublished research ﬁ ndings are
sometimes refuted by subsequent
evidence, with ensuing confusion
and disappointment. Refutation and
controversy is seen across the range of
research designs, from clinical trials
and traditional epidemiological studies
 to the most modern molecular
research . There is increasing
concern that in modern research, false
ﬁ ndings may be the majority or even
the vast majority of published research
claims . However, this should
not be surprising. It can be proven
that most claimed research ﬁ ndings
are false. Here I will examine the key
factors that inﬂ uence this problem and
some corollaries thereof.
Modeling the Framework for False
Positive Findings
Several methodologists have
pointed out that the high
rate of nonreplication (lack of
conﬁ rmation) of research discoveries
is a consequence of the convenient,
yet ill-founded strategy of claiming
conclusive research ﬁ ndings solely on
the basis of a single study assessed by
formal statistical signiﬁ cance, typically
for a p-value less than 0.05. Research
is not most appropriately represented
and summarized by p-values, but,
unfortunately, there is a widespread
notion that medical research articles
should be interpreted based only on
p-values. Research ﬁ ndings are deﬁ ned
here as any relationship reaching
formal statistical signiﬁ cance, e.g.,
effective interventions, informative
predictors, risk factors, or associations.
“Negative” research is also very useful.
“Negative” is actually a misnomer, and
the misinterpretation is widespread.
However, here we will target
relationships that investigators claim
exist, rather than null ﬁ ndings.
As has been shown previously, the
probability that a research ﬁ nding
is indeed true depends on the prior
probability of it being true (before
doing the study), the statistical power
of the study, and the level of statistical
signiﬁ cance . Consider a 2 × 2
table in which research ﬁ ndings are
compared against the gold standard
of true relationships in a scientiﬁ c
ﬁ eld. In a research ﬁ eld both true and
false hypotheses can be made about
the presence of relationships. Let R
be the ratio of the number of “true
relationships” to “no relationships”
among those tested in the ﬁ eld. R
is characteristic of the ﬁ eld and can
vary a lot depending on whether the
ﬁ eld targets highly likely relationships
or searches for only one or a few
true relationships among thousands
and millions of hypotheses that may
be postulated. Let us also consider,
for computational simplicity,
circumscribed ﬁ elds where either there
is only one true relationship (among
many that can be hypothesized) or
the power is similar to ﬁ nd any of the
several existing true relationships. The
pre-study probability of a relationship
being true is R⁄(R + 1). The probability
of a study ﬁ nding a true relationship
reﬂ ects the power 1 − β (one minus
the Type II error rate). The probability
of claiming a relationship when none
truly exists reﬂ ects the Type I error
rate, α. Assuming that c relationships
are being probed in the ﬁ eld, the
expected values of the 2 × 2 table are
given in Table 1. After a research
ﬁ nding has been claimed based on
achieving formal statistical signiﬁ cance,
the post-study probability that it is true
is the positive predictive value, PPV.
The PPV is also the complementary
probability of what Wacholder et al.
have called the false positive report
probability . According to the 2
× 2 table, one gets PPV = (1 − β)R⁄(R
− βR + α). A research ﬁ nding is thus

There is increasing concern that most
current published research ﬁ ndings are
false. The probability that a research claim
is true may depend on study power and
bias, the number of other studies on the
same question, and, importantly, the ratio
of true to no relationships among the
relationships probed in each scientiﬁ c
ﬁ eld. In this framework, a research ﬁ nding
is less likely to be true when the studies
conducted in a ﬁ eld are smaller; when
effect sizes are smaller; when there is a
greater number and lesser preselection
of tested relationships; where there is
greater ﬂ exibility in designs, deﬁ nitions,
outcomes, and analytical modes; when
there is greater ﬁ nancial and other
interest and prejudice; and when more
teams are involved in a scientiﬁ c ﬁ eld
in chase of statistical signiﬁ cance.
Simulations show that for most study
designs and settings, it is more likely for
a research claim to be false than true.
Moreover, for many current scientiﬁ c
ﬁ elds, claimed research ﬁ ndings may
often be simply accurate measures of the
prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the
implications of these problems for the
conduct and interpretation of research.
It can be proven that
most claimed research
ﬁ ndings are false.

more likely true than false if (1 − β)R
> α. Since usually the vast majority of
investigators depend on α = 0.05, this
means that a research ﬁ nding is more
likely true than false if (1 − β)R > 0.05.
What is less well appreciated is
that bias and the extent of repeated
independent testing by different teams
of investigators around the globe may
further distort this picture and may
lead to even smaller probabilities of the
research ﬁ ndings being indeed true.
We will try to model these two factors in
the context of similar 2 × 2 tables.
First, let us deﬁ ne bias as the
combination of various design, data,
analysis, and presentation factors that
tend to produce research ﬁ ndings
when they should not be produced.
Let u be the proportion of probed
analyses that would not have been
“research ﬁ ndings,” but nevertheless
end up presented and reported as
such, because of bias. Bias should not
be confused with chance variability
that causes some ﬁ ndings to be false by
chance even though the study design,
data, analysis, and presentation are
perfect. Bias can entail manipulation
in the analysis or reporting of ﬁ ndings.
Selective or distorted reporting is a
typical form of such bias. We may
assume that u does not depend on
whether a true relationship exists
or not. This is not an unreasonable
assumption, since typically it is
impossible to know which relationships
are indeed true. In the presence of bias
(Table 2), one gets PPV = ([1 − β]R +
uβR)⁄(R + α − βR + u − uα + uβR), and
PPV decreases with increasing u, unless
1 − β ≤ α, i.e., 1 − β ≤ 0.05 for most
situations. Thus, with increasing bias,
the chances that a research ﬁ nding
is true diminish considerably. This is
shown for different levels of power and
for different pre-study odds in Figure 1.
Conversely, true research ﬁ ndings
may occasionally be annulled because
of reverse bias. For example, with large
measurement errors relationships
are lost in noise , or investigators
use data inefﬁ ciently or fail to notice
statistically signiﬁ cant relationships, or
there may be conﬂ icts of interest that
tend to “bury” signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings .
There is no good large-scale empirical
evidence on how frequently such
reverse bias may occur across diverse
research ﬁ elds. However, it is probably
fair to say that reverse bias is not as
common. Moreover measurement
errors and inefﬁ cient use of data are
probably becoming less frequent
problems, since measurement error has
decreased with technological advances
in the molecular era and investigators
are becoming increasingly sophisticated
about their data. Regardless, reverse
bias may be modeled in the same way as
bias above. Also reverse bias should not
be confused with chance variability that
may lead to missing a true relationship
because of chance.
Testing by Several Independent
Several independent teams may be
addressing the same sets of research
questions. As research efforts are
globalized, it is practically the rule
that several research teams, often
dozens of them, may probe the same
or similar questions. Unfortunately, in
some areas, the prevailing mentality
until now has been to focus on
isolated discoveries by single teams
and interpret research experiments
in isolation. An increasing number
of questions have at least one study
claiming a research ﬁ nding, and
this receives unilateral attention.
The probability that at least one
study, among several done on the
same question, claims a statistically
signiﬁ cant research ﬁ nding is easy to
estimate. For n independent studies of
equal power, the 2 × 2 table is shown in
Table 3: PPV = R(1 − βn)⁄(R + 1 − [1 −
α]n − Rβn) (not considering bias). With
increasing number of independent
studies, PPV tends to decrease, unless
1 − β < α, i.e., typically 1 − β < 0.05.
This is shown for different levels of
power and for different pre-study odds
in Figure 2. For n studies of different
power, the term βn is replaced by the
product of the terms βi for i = 1 to n,
but inferences are similar.
Corollaries
A practical example is shown in Box
1. Based on the above considerations,
one may deduce several interesting
corollaries about the probability that a
research ﬁ nding is indeed true.
Corollary 1: The smaller the studies
conducted in a scientiﬁ c ﬁ eld, the less
likely the research ﬁ ndings are to be
true. Small sample size means smaller
power and, for all functions above,
the PPV for a true research ﬁ nding
decreases as power decreases towards
1 − β = 0.05. Thus, other factors being
equal, research ﬁ ndings are more likely
true in scientiﬁ c ﬁ elds that undertake
large studies, such as randomized
controlled trials in cardiology (several
thousand subjects randomized) 
than in scientiﬁ c ﬁ elds with small
studies, such as most research of
molecular predictors (sample sizes 100fold smaller) .
Corollary 2: The smaller the effect
sizes in a scientiﬁ c ﬁ eld, the less likely
the research ﬁ ndings are to be true.
Power is also related to the effect
size. Thus research ﬁ ndings are more
likely true in scientiﬁ c ﬁ elds with large
effects, such as the impact of smoking
on cancer or cardiovascular disease
(relative risks 3–20), than in scientiﬁ c
ﬁ elds where postulated effects are
small, such as genetic risk factors for
multigenetic diseases (relative risks
1.1–1.5) . Modern epidemiology is
increasingly obliged to target smaller

effect sizes . Consequently, the
proportion of true research ﬁ ndings
is expected to decrease. In the same
line of thinking, if the true effect sizes
are very small in a scientiﬁ c ﬁ eld,
this ﬁ eld is likely to be plagued by
almost ubiquitous false positive claims.
For example, if the majority of true
genetic or nutritional determinants of
complex diseases confer relative risks
less than 1.05, genetic or nutritional
epidemiology would be largely utopian
endeavors.
Corollary 3: The greater the number
and the lesser the selection of tested
relationships in a scientiﬁ c ﬁ eld, the
less likely the research ﬁ ndings are to
be true. As shown above, the post-study
probability that a ﬁ nding is true (PPV)
depends a lot on the pre-study odds
(R). Thus, research ﬁ ndings are more
likely true in conﬁ rmatory designs,
such as large phase III randomized
controlled trials, or meta-analyses
thereof, than in hypothesis-generating
experiments. Fields considered highly
informative and creative given the
wealth of the assembled and tested
information, such as microarrays and
other high-throughput discoveryoriented research , should have
extremely low PPV.
Corollary 4: The greater the
ﬂ exibility in designs, deﬁ nitions,
outcomes, and analytical modes in
a scientiﬁ c ﬁ eld, the less likely the
research ﬁ ndings are to be true.
Flexibility increases the potential for
transforming what would be “negative”
results into “positive” results, i.e., bias,
u. For several research designs, e.g.,
randomized controlled trials 
or meta-analyses , there have
been efforts to standardize their
conduct and reporting. Adherence to
common standards is likely to increase
the proportion of true ﬁ ndings. The
same applies to outcomes. True
ﬁ ndings may be more common
when outcomes are unequivocal and
universally agreed (e.g., death) rather
than when multifarious outcomes are
devised (e.g., scales for schizophrenia
outcomes) . Similarly, ﬁ elds that
use commonly agreed, stereotyped
analytical methods (e.g., Kaplan-
Meier plots and the log-rank test)
 may yield a larger proportion
of true ﬁ ndings than ﬁ elds where
analytical methods are still under
experimentation (e.g., artiﬁ cial
intelligence methods) and only “best”
results are reported. Regardless, even
in the most stringent research designs,
bias seems to be a major problem.
For example, there is strong evidence
that selective outcome reporting,
with manipulation of the outcomes
and analyses reported, is a common
problem even for randomized trails
 . Simply abolishing selective
publication would not make this
problem go away.
Corollary 5: The greater the ﬁ nancial
and other interests and prejudices
in a scientiﬁ c ﬁ eld, the less likely
the research ﬁ ndings are to be true.
Conﬂ icts of interest and prejudice may
increase bias, u. Conﬂ icts of interest
are very common in biomedical
research , and typically they are
inadequately and sparsely reported
 . Prejudice may not necessarily
have ﬁ nancial roots. Scientists in a
given ﬁ eld may be prejudiced purely
because of their belief in a scientiﬁ c
theory or commitment to their own
ﬁ ndings. Many otherwise seemingly
independent, university-based studies
may be conducted for no other reason
than to give physicians and researchers
qualiﬁ cations for promotion or tenure.
Such nonﬁ nancial conﬂ icts may also
lead to distorted reported results and
interpretations. Prestigious investigators
may suppress via the peer review process
the appearance and dissemination of
ﬁ ndings that refute their ﬁ ndings, thus
condemning their ﬁ eld to perpetuate
false dogma. Empirical evidence
on expert opinion shows that it is
extremely unreliable .
Corollary 6: The hotter a
scientiﬁ c ﬁ eld (with more scientiﬁ c
teams involved), the less likely the
research ﬁ ndings are to be true.
This seemingly paradoxical corollary
follows because, as stated above, the
PPV of isolated ﬁ ndings decreases
when many teams of investigators
are involved in the same ﬁ eld. This
may explain why we occasionally see
major excitement followed rapidly
by severe disappointments in ﬁ elds
that draw wide attention. With many
teams working on the same ﬁ eld and
with massive experimental data being
produced, timing is of the essence
in beating competition. Thus, each
team may prioritize on pursuing and
disseminating its most impressive
“positive” results. “Negative” results may
become attractive for dissemination
only if some other team has found
a “positive” association on the same
question. In that case, it may be
attractive to refute a claim made in
some prestigious journal. The term
Proteus phenomenon has been coined
to describe this phenomenon of rapidly

alternating extreme research claims
and extremely opposite refutations
 . Empirical evidence suggests that
this sequence of extreme opposites is
very common in molecular genetics
These corollaries consider each
factor separately, but these factors often
inﬂ uence each other. For example,
investigators working in ﬁ elds where
true effect sizes are perceived to be
small may be more likely to perform
large studies than investigators working
in ﬁ elds where true effect sizes are
perceived to be large. Or prejudice
may prevail in a hot scientiﬁ c ﬁ eld,
further undermining the predictive
value of its research ﬁ ndings. Highly
prejudiced stakeholders may even
create a barrier that aborts efforts at
obtaining and disseminating opposing
results. Conversely, the fact that a ﬁ eld
is hot or has strong invested interests
may sometimes promote larger studies
and improved standards of research,
enhancing the predictive value of its
research ﬁ ndings. Or massive discoveryoriented testing may result in such a
large yield of signiﬁ cant relationships
that investigators have enough to
report and search further and thus
refrain from data dredging and
manipulation.
Most Research Findings Are False
for Most Research Designs and for
Most Fields
In the described framework, a PPV
exceeding 50% is quite difﬁ cult to
get. Table 4 provides the results
of simulations using the formulas
developed for the inﬂ uence of power,
ratio of true to non-true relationships,
and bias, for various types of situations
that may be characteristic of speciﬁ c
study designs and settings. A ﬁ nding
from a well-conducted, adequately
powered randomized controlled trial
starting with a 50% pre-study chance
that the intervention is effective is
eventually true about 85% of the time.
A fairly similar performance is expected
of a conﬁ rmatory meta-analysis of
good-quality randomized trials:
potential bias probably increases, but
power and pre-test chances are higher
compared to a single randomized trial.
Conversely, a meta-analytic ﬁ nding
from inconclusive studies where
pooling is used to “correct” the low
power of single studies, is probably
false if R ≤ 1:3. Research ﬁ ndings from
underpowered, early-phase clinical
trials would be true about one in four
times, or even less frequently if bias
is present. Epidemiological studies of
an exploratory nature perform even
worse, especially when underpowered,
but even well-powered epidemiological
studies may have only a one in
ﬁ ve chance being true, if R = 1:10.
Finally, in discovery-oriented research
with massive testing, where tested
relationships exceed true ones 1,000fold (e.g., 30,000 genes tested, of which
30 may be the true culprits) ,
PPV for each claimed relationship is
extremely low, even with considerable
Box 1. An Example: Science
at Low Pre-Study Odds
Let us assume that a team of
investigators performs a whole genome
association study to test whether
any of 100,000 gene polymorphisms
are associated with susceptibility to
schizophrenia. Based on what we
know about the extent of heritability
of the disease, it is reasonable to
expect that probably around ten
gene polymorphisms among those
tested would be truly associated with
schizophrenia, with relatively similar
odds ratios around 1.3 for the ten or so
polymorphisms and with a fairly similar
power to identify any of them. Then
R = 10/100,000 = 10−4, and the pre-study
probability for any polymorphism to be
associated with schizophrenia is also
R/(R + 1) = 10−4. Let us also suppose that
the study has 60% power to ﬁ nd an
association with an odds ratio of 1.3 at
α = 0.05. Then it can be estimated that
if a statistically signiﬁ cant association is
found with the p-value barely crossing the
0.05 threshold, the post-study probability
that this is true increases about 12-fold
compared with the pre-study probability,
but it is still only 12 × 10−4.
Now let us suppose that the
investigators manipulate their design,
analyses, and reporting so as to make
more relationships cross the p = 0.05
threshold even though this would not
have been crossed with a perfectly
adhered to design and analysis and with
perfect comprehensive reporting of the
results, strictly according to the original
study plan. Such manipulation could be
done, for example, with serendipitous
inclusion or exclusion of certain patients
or controls, post hoc subgroup analyses,
investigation of genetic contrasts that
were not originally speciﬁ ed, changes
in the disease or control deﬁ nitions,
and various combinations of selective
or distorted reporting of the results.
Commercially available “data mining”
packages actually are proud of their
ability to yield statistically signiﬁ cant
results through data dredging. In the
presence of bias with u = 0.10, the poststudy probability that a research ﬁ nding
is true is only 4.4 × 10−4. Furthermore,
even in the absence of any bias, when
ten independent research teams perform
similar experiments around the world, if
one of them ﬁ nds a formally statistically
signiﬁ cant association, the probability
that the research ﬁ nding is true is only
1.5 × 10−4, hardly any higher than the
probability we had before any of this
extensive research was undertaken!

standardization of laboratory and
statistical methods, outcomes, and
reporting thereof to minimize bias.
Claimed Research Findings
May Often Be Simply Accurate
Measures of the Prevailing Bias
As shown, the majority of modern
biomedical research is operating in
areas with very low pre- and poststudy probability for true ﬁ ndings.
Let us suppose that in a research ﬁ eld
there are no true ﬁ ndings at all to be
discovered. History of science teaches
us that scientiﬁ c endeavor has often
in the past wasted effort in ﬁ elds with
absolutely no yield of true scientiﬁ c
information, at least based on our
current understanding. In such a “null
ﬁ eld,” one would ideally expect all
observed effect sizes to vary by chance
around the null in the absence of bias.
The extent that observed ﬁ ndings
deviate from what is expected by
chance alone would be simply a pure
measure of the prevailing bias.
For example, let us suppose that
no nutrients or dietary patterns are
actually important determinants for
the risk of developing a speciﬁ c tumor.
Let us also suppose that the scientiﬁ c
literature has examined 60 nutrients
and claims all of them to be related to
the risk of developing this tumor with
relative risks in the range of 1.2 to 1.4
for the comparison of the upper to
lower intake tertiles. Then the claimed
effect sizes are simply measuring
nothing else but the net bias that has
been involved in the generation of
this scientiﬁ c literature. Claimed effect
sizes are in fact the most accurate
estimates of the net bias. It even follows
that between “null ﬁ elds,” the ﬁ elds
that claim stronger effects (often with
accompanying claims of medical or
public health importance) are simply
those that have sustained the worst
For ﬁ elds with very low PPV, the few
true relationships would not distort
this overall picture much. Even if a
few relationships are true, the shape
of the distribution of the observed
effects would still yield a clear measure
of the biases involved in the ﬁ eld. This
concept totally reverses the way we
view scientiﬁ c results. Traditionally,
investigators have viewed large
and highly signiﬁ cant effects with
excitement, as signs of important
discoveries. Too large and too highly
signiﬁ cant effects may actually be more
likely to be signs of large bias in most
ﬁ elds of modern research. They should
lead investigators to careful critical
thinking about what might have gone
wrong with their data, analyses, and
Of course, investigators working in
any ﬁ eld are likely to resist accepting
that the whole ﬁ eld in which they have
spent their careers is a “null ﬁ eld.”
However, other lines of evidence,
or advances in technology and
experimentation, may lead eventually
to the dismantling of a scientiﬁ c ﬁ eld.
Obtaining measures of the net bias
in one ﬁ eld may also be useful for
obtaining insight into what might be
the range of bias operating in other
ﬁ elds where similar analytical methods,
technologies, and conﬂ icts may be
operating.
How Can We Improve
the Situation?
Is it unavoidable that most research
ﬁ ndings are false, or can we improve
the situation? A major problem is that
it is impossible to know with 100%
certainty what the truth is in any
research question. In this regard, the
pure “gold” standard is unattainable.
However, there are several approaches
to improve the post-study probability.
Better powered evidence, e.g., large
studies or low-bias meta-analyses,
may help, as it comes closer to the
unknown “gold” standard. However,
large studies may still have biases
and these should be acknowledged
and avoided. Moreover, large-scale
evidence is impossible to obtain for all
of the millions and trillions of research
questions posed in current research.
Large-scale evidence should be
targeted for research questions where
the pre-study probability is already
considerably high, so that a signiﬁ cant
research ﬁ nding will lead to a post-test
probability that would be considered
quite deﬁ nitive. Large-scale evidence is
also particularly indicated when it can
test major concepts rather than narrow,
speciﬁ c questions. A negative ﬁ nding
can then refute not only a speciﬁ c
proposed claim, but a whole ﬁ eld or
considerable portion thereof. Selecting
the performance of large-scale studies
based on narrow-minded criteria,
such as the marketing promotion of a
speciﬁ c drug, is largely wasted research.
Moreover, one should be cautious
that extremely large studies may be
more likely to ﬁ nd a formally statistical
signiﬁ cant difference for a trivial effect
that is not really meaningfully different
from the null .
Second, most research questions
are addressed by many teams, and
it is misleading to emphasize the
statistically signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings of
any single team. What matters is the

totality of the evidence. Diminishing
bias through enhanced research
standards and curtailing of prejudices
may also help. However, this may
require a change in scientiﬁ c mentality
that might be difﬁ cult to achieve.
In some research designs, efforts
may also be more successful with
upfront registration of studies, e.g.,
randomized trials . Registration
would pose a challenge for hypothesisgenerating research. Some kind of
registration or networking of data
collections or investigators within ﬁ elds
may be more feasible than registration
of each and every hypothesisgenerating experiment. Regardless,
even if we do not see a great deal of
progress with registration of studies
in other ﬁ elds, the principles of
developing and adhering to a protocol
could be more widely borrowed from
randomized controlled trials.
Finally, instead of chasing statistical
signiﬁ cance, we should improve our
understanding of the range of R
values—the pre-study odds—where
research efforts operate . Before
running an experiment, investigators
should consider what they believe the
chances are that they are testing a true
rather than a non-true relationship.
Speculated high R values may
sometimes then be ascertained. As
described above, whenever ethically
acceptable, large studies with minimal
bias should be performed on research
ﬁ ndings that are considered relatively
established, to see how often they are
indeed conﬁ rmed. I suspect several
established “classics” will fail the test
Nevertheless, most new discoveries
will continue to stem from hypothesisgenerating research with low or very
low pre-study odds. We should then
acknowledge that statistical signiﬁ cance
testing in the report of a single study
gives only a partial picture, without
knowing how much testing has been
done outside the report and in the
relevant ﬁ eld at large. Despite a large
statistical literature for multiple testing
corrections , usually it is impossible
to decipher how much data dredging
by the reporting authors or other
research teams has preceded a reported
research ﬁ nding. Even if determining
this were feasible, this would not
inform us about the pre-study odds.
Thus, it is unavoidable that one should
make approximate assumptions on how
many relationships are expected to be
true among those probed across the
relevant research ﬁ elds and research
designs. The wider ﬁ eld may yield some
guidance for estimating this probability
for the isolated research project.
Experiences from biases detected in
other neighboring ﬁ elds would also be
useful to draw upon. Even though these
assumptions would be considerably
subjective, they would still be very
useful in interpreting research claims
and putting them in context. 
