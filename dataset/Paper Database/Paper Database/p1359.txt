A set of Modiﬁed Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potentials for the interactions between Al,
Si, Mg, Cu, and Fe was developed from a combination of each element’s MEAM potential in order to
study metal alloying. Previously published MEAM parameters of single elements have been improved
for better agreement to the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) curves when compared with
ab-initio generated GSFE curves. The MEAM parameters for element pairs were constructed based
on the structural and elastic properties of element pairs in the NaCl reference structure garnered
from ab-initio calculations, with adjustment to reproduce the ab-initio heat of formation of the most
stable binary compounds. The new MEAM potentials were validated by comparing the formation
energies of defects, equilibrium volumes, elastic moduli, and heat of formation for several binary
compounds with ab-initio simulations and experiments. Single elements in their ground state crystal
structure were subjected to heating to test the potentials at elevated temperatures. An Al potential
was modiﬁed to avoid formation of an unphysical solid structure at high temperatures. The thermal
expansion coeﬃcient of a compound with the composition of AA 6061 alloy was evaluated and
compared with experimental values. MEAM potential tests performed in this work, utilizing the
universal Atomistic Simulation Environment (ASE), are distributed to facilitate reproducibility of
the results.

INTRODUCTION
Historically, materials have been developed through
the correlation of processing and properties. Several implementations of materials science principles have given
birth to an engineering framework for materials design.
Over the past two decades, more eﬃcient computational
methodologies have been developed and the computational power have increased enormously, making the computational materials design an essential cost-eﬀective tool
to design materials properties. Since materials complexities can limit the degree of predictability, several timeand length-scale methodologies (hence spatiotemporal
hierarchy) for computational materials design naturally
evolved (cf. Horstemeyer 1 for a review). Out of several
computational methodologies, atomistic simulations not
only can predict the materials properties from a statistical
viewpoint, but can also quantify the mechanisms of the
structure-property relationship. One of the most critical
components of atomistic simulations is the interatomic potential, which determines the forces on individual atoms.
First-principles calculations certainly are capable of providing very reliable interatomic potentials in a variety of
chemical environments. However, realistic simulations of
alloy systems, which are essential to reveal many macroscopic materials properties, often require a number of
atoms that renders these methods impractical – they either require too much computer memory or take too long
to be completed in a reasonable amount of time. One alternative is to use (semi-)empirical interaction potentials
that can be evaluated eﬃciently, so that the atomistic
approaches that use them can, in certain cases, handle
systems with more than a million atoms.
The Embedded-Atom Method (EAM) is a widely used
atomic level semiempirical model for metals, covalent
materials, and impurities2. MEAM (Modiﬁed EAM) incorporates angular dependency of electron density into
EAM. Atomistic simulations of a wide range of elements
and alloys have been performed using MEAM potentials.
MEAM model was ﬁrst used for silicon, germanium, and
their alloys3. It was applied to 26 single elements4 and to
silicon-nickel5 alloys and interfaces. Gall et al. 6 have used
MEAM to model tensile debonding of an aluminum-silicon
interface. Lee and Baskes 7 improved MEAM to account
for the second nearest-neighbor interactions. Also, Huang
et al. 8 used MEAM and two other potentials to deterarXiv:1107.0544v6 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 8 Mar 2012
mine defect energetics in beta-SiC. MEAM parameters
for nickel9 and molybdenum-silicon system10 were determined by Baskes. MEAM potentials for Cu, Ag, Au,
Ni, Pd, Pt, Al, and Pb based on the ﬁrst and the second
nearest-neighbor MEAM were constructed by Lee et al. 11.
Hu et al. 12,13 proposed a new analytic modiﬁed EAM
many-body potential and applied it to 17 hcp metals. The
structural properties of various polytypes of carbon were
described using a MEAM potential by Lee and Lee 14.
Recent work of Lee et al. 15 summarized available MEAM
potentials for single elements and alloys. Several of these
potentials were then used to perform large scale atomistic
simulations to understand the intriguing nature of the
ductile and brittle fracture16, structure-property relationship17, dislocation dynamics18,19, and nature of materials
fracture20,21.
Aluminum, magnesium, copper, and iron alloys are
being used in developing materials with novel properties.
Great popularity of these alloys is connected to their general functional properties, mechanical properties, mass
density, corrosion resistance, and machinability. Light
metal alloys, such as magnesium and aluminum alloys,
are now demanded for use in the automotive and aviation industries. They performed remarkably well for the
purpose of decreasing the operating expenses and fuel
consumption. These alloys usually contain several other
minor elements, such as silicon, nickel, and manganese,
and are known to have very complex phase compositions.
Assessment of such complex systems is a very challenging
task, since diﬀerent constituent elements can form diﬀerent phases, whose selection depends on the ratio between
the constituents and also on a variety of processing and
treatment factors.
Contrary to DFT potentials, most of the single element semiempirical potentials do not combine easily into
multi-component alloy models.
The diﬃculty of combining single element EAM potentials into alloy systems
comes from the need of their normalization22. The procedure to form EAM alloy parameterization from single
element potentials was suggested23,24, but it does not
guarantee that the resulting potential will be suitable for
modeling compounds25. Alloy potentials usually introduce new parameters for each pair of elements, allowing to
ﬁt properties of their binary compounds. The number of
parameters to adjust and the number of tests to perform
is proportional to the square of the number of constituent
elements. In the present MEAM approach, each pair
interaction is characterized by a total of 13 parameters
(Table V, and the ratio of density scaling factors ρ0 for
constituent elements, Table I). Adoption of the default
value Cmax = 2.8 leads to 9 adjustable parameters for
each pair. Comparable angularly dependent potentials for
the Fe-Ni system26 also have 9 adjustable pair parameters.
While the semiempirical potentials have been developed
and tested for binary alloys27–31, binaries, similarly to
single element potentials, may not combine easily into
ternaries. Modeling of ternary systems faces a challenge
since less experimental properties are available for ternary
systems. Ternary potentials are usually examined only at
a particular composition range—the number of possible
compositions grows to the power of the number of constituent elements. It is also nontrivial to ﬁnd an equilibrium structure for complex systems of representative size
at low temperatures. Ternary potentials are only available
for Fe/Ni-Cr-O32 (MEAM), Pu-Ga-He33 (MEAM), Fe-
Ti-C/N, Cu-Zr-Ag, Ga-In-N, Fe-Nb-C/N34–37 (MEAM),
H-C-O38 (Reactive Force Field, ReaxFF), Ni-Al-H39, Zr-
Cu-Al40, and Fe-Cu-Ni41 (EAM) systems. To extend from
binaries to ternaries, MEAM provides a ternary screening parameter CXYZ. In the present work we did not
examine ternary systems. Instead, we performed thermal
expansion simulations of a compound including all species
of the potential. The default values of Cmin = 2.0 and
Cmax = 2.8 were applied for ternary screening. Since an
eﬀort beyond the scope of our project is required for satisﬁable validation of the 5-element alloy potential under
varying temperatures, compositions, and conﬁguration
states, we concentrated on basic tests and on providing
tools to facilitate reproducibility of the tests42.
In the present study we develop a MEAM potential for
aluminum, silicon, magnesium, copper, iron, and their
combinations. We ﬁt the potential to the properties of
single elements and element pairs, but the model implicitly allows calculations with any combination of elements.
We show the applied MEAM methodology in Appendix A.
The DFT calculations are described in Sec. II. In Sec. III,
the single-element volume-energy curves in basic crystal
structures, and also important material properties, such
as formation energies of vacancies, self-interstitials, surfaces, and generalized stacking fault energies from MEAM
are examined and compared with DFT calculations. In
Sec. IV, the MEAM potential parameters for each unlike
element pair are initialized to ﬁt the ab-initio heat of
formation, equilibrium volume, and elastic moduli of the
hypothetical NaCl reference structure. Heat of formation
of binary compounds in a variety of crystal structures
from MEAM are thereafter examined and compared with
the ab-initio and experimental results. The MEAM parameters are adjusted to match the DFT formation energy
of the most stable compounds. The structural and elastic
properties for several binary compounds and formation
energies of substitutional defects are compared with abinitio and experimental results. Finally we performed
thermal expansion simulations of a compound with the
composition of an AA 6061 alloy (IV C). We conclude
with a short summary.
AB-INITIO CALCULATIONS
Ab-initio total energy calculations in this work were
based on density functional theory (DFT), using the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method43 as implemented
in the VASP code44. Exchange-correlation eﬀects were
treated by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
as parameterized by Perdew et al. 45. All DFT calcula-

are fcc, diamond, hcp, fcc, and bcc, respectively. Ec is the cohesive energy, a0 is the equilibrium lattice parameter, A is the
scaling factor for the embedding energy, α is the exponential decay factor for the universal energy, β(0−3) are the exponential

parameters, ρ0 is the density scaling factor that is relevant only for element pairs. Deﬁnition of these parameters may be found
in Ref. 4. Non-zero parameters δr in Rose Eq. (B1–B4) were used for Al (δr = 0.1) and Fe (δr = 0.3), along with δa = 0.0.
tions were performed in high precision with the planewave cut-oﬀenergy set to 400 eV in order to achieve the
convergence of heat of formation and elastic properties.
Integration over the irreducible Brillouin zone was performed using the Γ-centered Monkhorst-Pack scheme46
with the size gradually increased to 7×7×7 for point
defects, to 19×19×1 for surfaces, and to 29×29×29 to
improve convergence of shear moduli at small strains.
Elastic constants presented here were obtained without
relaxation of atomic positions. Since most of the examined
high energy structures are, at best, metastable, relaxation
does not maintain the crystal symmetry, resulting in large
energy changes and unphysical elastic constants.
MEAM PARAMETERS FOR SINGLE
The present MEAM parameters for single elements are
listed in Table I. The initial values of these parameters
were taken from existing MEAM potentials4,11,47,48. The
Cmin screening parameter for Al, Mg, and Cu was lowered
from 2.0 to 0.8 to improve the GSFE curves (Sec. III E).
The Mg potential was adjusted to reproduce the DFT
values of hcp, bcc, and fcc energy diﬀerences, vacancy
formation energy, and (10¯10) surface formation energy.
The Al potential was modiﬁed to prevent formation of an
unknown structure at elevated temperatures (Sec. IV C).
Energy dependence on volume of single
elements in fcc, hcp, bcc, and simple cubic crystal
structures
The ﬁrst test of the validity of MEAM potential for single elements is a comparison of the energy-volume curves
in the fcc, hcp, bcc, diamond, and simple cubic crystal
structures, shown in Fig. 1. The MEAM potentials appropriately capture the lowest energy structures of Al
(fcc), Si (dia), Mg (hcp), Cu (fcc), and Fe (bcc). Also,
the equilibrium volumes of several crystal structures from
MEAM closely match the DFT results. Better match
of DFT energy diﬀerences and volume ratios can possibly be obtained by optimization of Si and Cu MEAM
parameters. Fe MEAM potential applied in the present
work is a MEAM-p variant of Fe potential from the recent
eﬀort of Lee et al. 48, exhibiting a correct low temperature phase stability with respect to the pressure. The fcc
equilibrium energy and volume from this Fe potential is
very close to the bcc equilibrium in order for the structural transition to appear at ﬁnite temperature without
magnetic contribution. In general the MEAM potentials
of the present work reproduced the DFT results for the
individual elements fairly well.
The formation energy of a single vacancy Evac
as the energy cost to create a vacancy:
= Etot[N] −Nε,
where Etot[N] is the total relaxed energy of a system
with N atoms containing a vacancy and ε is the energy
per atom in the bulk. Cell volume and atomic positions
were relaxed in each case. Table II shows the formation
energies of a single vacancy for the fcc Al cell, diamond
Si cell, hcp Mg, fcc Cu, and bcc Fe obtained from the
MEAM and DFT calculations. The MEAM systems sizes
were 5×5×5 primitive fcc and bcc cells, 3×3×3 primitive
diamond cells, and 8×4×4 orthogonal hcp cells.
the DFT systems, the simulation sizes were 5×5×5 fcc,
4×4×4 diamond and bcc, and 4×4×2 hcp primitive cells.
The vacancy formation energy of Mg was slightly improved in comparison with previous MEAM results47.
Overall agreement of vacancy formation energies between
MEAM, experiment, and DFT was within a few eV, and
the present results are comparable or better than those
from other calculations. The reduction in volume due
to the formation of a vacancy agrees well with the DFT,
except the value for Fe is somewhat low.

Self-interstitials
The formation energy of an interstitial point defect Eint
is given by
= Etot[N + 1] −NεX −εY
where Etot[N + 1] is the total energy of a system with
N type-X bulk atoms plus one impurity atom of type-Y
inserted at one of the interstitial sites, and εX (εY) is
the total energy per atom of type-X (type-Y) in its most
stable bulk structure. The inserted atom Y can be of the
same type as the bulk, in which case the point defect is
called a self-interstitial defect. Self-interstitial formation
energies were calculated for Al, Si, Mg, and Cu at the
octahedral, tetrahedral, and dumbbell sites. Dumbbell
orientations were for fcc, for hcp, and for
bcc and diamond structures. Relaxations of the atomic
positions and the volume were also performed, and the
DFT and MEAM results are listed in Table III. Similar
to the previous calculations, the MEAM systems sizes
were 5×5×5 primitive fcc and bcc cells, 3×3×3 primitive
diamond cells, and 8×4×4 orthogonal hcp cells.

and 4×4×2 hcp primitive cells.

In general, the DFT results are well reproduced or
slightly underestimated by the MEAM potentials. According to the present MEAM potential, the most stable
form of a self-interstitial defect for fcc Al is a dumbbell
along the direction, in agreement with the DFT results and an experimental observation by Jesson et al. 77.
The results for Mg are better than those published previously47,73. The present Mg potential indicates that the
tetrahedral site will be most stable in agreement with
the DFT calculations.
For both Cu and Fe, the new
MEAM potential produces the same relative stability of
the examined interstitial sites with the DFT calculations.
A semi-inﬁnite surface is one of the simplest forms of
defects. To test the transferability of the new MEAM
potentials, formation energies for several 1×1×7 surface
slabs with 8 ˚A vacuum layer were computed. Eight atomic
layers were used for the Si(111) surface and 12 layers
for the 2×1 Si(100) surface reconstruction. The surface
formation energy per unit surface area Esurf is deﬁned as
= Etot[N] −Nε

where Etot[N] is the total energy of the structure with
two surfaces, N is the number of atoms in the structure,
ε is the total energy per atom in the bulk, and A is the
total area of both surfaces. Table IV shows the surface
formation energies of several surfaces constructed from
fcc Al, hcp Mg, fcc Cu, and bcc Fe crystals. Results
from the present MEAM potentials agree, in the order
of magnitude, with the DFT calculations, except for Fe
values being underestimated.
The surfaces with lowest energy without reconstruction
are identiﬁed correctly by the present MEAM potentials.
The 2×1 reconstruction of the Si(100) surface leads to
symmetric dimers in accord with other Si potentials86.
Note that surface formation energies from the present
PAW GGA calculations are lower than our previously
published results47 using ultrasoft pseudopotentials within
local density (LDA) approximation—it is known that
GGA leads to surface energies which are 7–16% lower
than LDA values for jellium and 16–29% lower than the
experimental results45,78. A procedure87 and new DFT
functionals88,89 were suggested to correct the errors of
LDA and GGA approximations. Similar correction can
be applied to vacancy formation energies90, but such
corrections were not applied in the present study.
Stacking faults
Using an assumption of a planar dislocation core, the
Peierls-Nabarro model91,92 is a powerful theory to quantify the dislocation core properties. In that model, a dislocation is deﬁned by a continuous distribution of shear
along the glide plane, and the restoring force acting between atoms on either sides of the interface is balanced
by the resultant stress of the distribution.
in the recent study of Carrez et al. 93, a solution of the
Peierls-Nabarro model can be obtained numerically by
identifying the restoring force to the gradient of the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) curve94. In addition,
Van Swygenhoven et al. 21 claimed that the nature of slip
in nanocrystalline metals cannot be described in terms
of an absolute value of the stacking fault energy, and a
correct interpretation requires the GSFE curve, which
shows the change in energy per unit area of the crystal
as a function of the displacement varied on the slip plane.
However, the GSFE curve is not experimentally accessible.
Therefore, to model dislocation properties reliably, the
GSFE curve calculated with the MEAM potential must
reproduce the DFT data.
The stacking fault energy per unit area of a stacking
f is deﬁned as
f = Etot[N] −Nε
where Etot[N] is the total energy of the structure with a
stacking fault, N is the number of atoms in the structure,
ε is the total energy per atom in the bulk, and A is the
total area of surface.
As a validation test of the MEAM potential, the GSFE
curves obtained by molecular statics (MS) were compared
with the DFT data by Zimmerman et al. 95 for Al and Cu,
by the present authors for Fe, and by Datta et al. 96 for
Mg. After lowering the Cmin parameter to 0.8, the GSFE
curves calculated by MS using the MEAM potential for
Al, Cu, and Mg show the skewed sinusoidal shape in
agreement with the DFT predictions (Fig. 2) illustrating
reasonable agreement with the DFT GSFE curves.
MEAM PARAMETERS FOR ELEMENT
The MEAM potential parameters for each element pair
were initialized to match the ab-initio heat of formation,
equilibrium volume, bulk modulus, and elastic moduli
in the hypothetical NaCl reference structure, which was
chosen for its simplicity. Since the equilibrium volume,
cohesive energy, and bulk modulus of the NaCl structure are directly related to MEAM parameters, they can
be reproduced exactly. An improved agreement of the
shear moduli from MEAM and ab-initio simulations was
achieved in some cases by adjusting the electron density
scaling factor ρ0. Then, heat of formation of binary compounds in a variety of crystal structures from MEAM
were examined and compared with the ab-initio results.
To correlate the MEAM results with the lowest formation energies of the compounds from DFT calculations,
the MEAM screening and △HXY
B1 parameters for element
pairs were adjusted. The ﬁnal MEAM parameters are
given in Table V. The predicted MEAM properties for
the NaCl reference structure are compared with DFT
results in Table VI, and show that in general the MEAM
heat of formation, bulk modulus, and equilibrium volume
reproduce the DFT results well. In contrast, the shear
elastic constants are not well reproduced. In fact the sign
of the shear elastic constant, representing crystal stability,
is frequently in disagreement with the DFT results. This
is really not a signiﬁcant problem as the NaCl structure
does not exist in nature. A more important criteria for
success of these potentials is how they perform for lower
energy crystal structures. We address this issue in the
next section.
Heat of formation for binary compounds
The alloy phases that the MEAM potential predicts as
most likely to form at the temperature T = 0 K are those
with the lowest heat of formation per atom, ∆H, which
is deﬁned as
∆H = Etot[NX + NY] −NXεX −NYεY
Etot is the total energy of the simulation cell, NX and NY
are the numbers of type-X and type-Y atoms in the cell,
εX and εY are the total energies per atom for type-X and
type-Y in their ground state bulk structures, respectively.
To check the validity of our new potentials, we computed the heat of formation per atom for many intermetallic phases of all alloy pairs. The total energy values
in Eq. (5) for B1, B2, B3, C1, C15, D03, A15, L12, and
other relevant structures were evaluated at the optimal
atomic volume for each structure. Heat of formation for
basic binary compounds based on the new MEAM potential and DFT results were calculated and compared with
experimental values (Figures 3–5). The DFT and MEAM

results for the phases with lowest ∆H are also shown in
Tables VIII–IX.
The agreement between MEAM and DFT is quite satisfactory. In most cases, the MEAM results preserve the
order of stability predicted by the DFT results.
diﬀerences in the heat of formation per atom from the
MEAM and DFT results are less than 0.5 eV at most. In
general the atomic volumes predicted by MEAM agree at
least qualitatively with the DFT and experimental results.
The MEAM calculations of the bulk moduli also agree
semi-quantitatively with DFT and experimental results,
usually within 20%. Predicted shear moduli usually follow the DFT and experimental results, but in some cases
there is signiﬁcant disagreement.
Substitutions
The formation energy of a substitutional point defect
, in the case of the substitution of a type-X atom of
the host with a type-Y atom, is deﬁned by
= Etot[(N −1) + 1] −(N −1)εX −εY
where Etot[(N −1) + 1] is the total energy of a system
of N −1 host type-X atoms and one type-Y atom that
replaced type-X atom in the original bulk position, εX and
εY are the total energies per atom for type-X and type-Y
atoms in their ground state bulk structures. Table VII
shows the results of substitutional defect calculations using the MEAM potentials and the DFT results. In general
the MEAM results qualitatively agree with the DFT results. In a number of cases of small heat of formation,
MEAM indicates a small heat, but of the incorrect sign.
The most signiﬁcant error is for Al in Si where MEAM
predicts a large endothermic heat and DFT predicts a
much smaller value, otherwise there is general agreement.
Finite temperature tests
Real life applications of MD potentials require extensive
testing at ﬁnite temperatures. Basic ﬁnite temperature
tests of the potentials, in accord with recommendations
of Lee et al. 15, revealed formation of an unknown solid
structure when the temperature of fcc Al crystal was

increased to 800 K under zero pressure conditions. To
prevent formation of this structure, β(1) and t(1) parameters of Al were adjusted. Heating of other elements under
zero pressure conditions did not result in forming new
structures.
To test a system including all components of the new
potential, an 20–100 ◦C average thermal expansion coeﬃcient of a model system with the composition similar to
AA 6061 alloy (Table X) was evaluated and compared with
experimental data. Atoms of constituents were placed in
the substitutional positions of a 20x20x20 fcc Al cell. The
system was heated from -200 ◦C to 20 ◦C (and 100 ◦C)
over the interval of 0.1 ns, and then equilibrated at 20 ◦C

TABLE XI. Thermal expansion coeﬃcient of single crystal Al

Table XI shows the values of 20–100 ◦C average thermal expansion coeﬃcients. The MEAM result for single
crystal Al is in the lower range of other MD potentials
and experiments.
Since Al is a dominant element of
the AA 6061 alloy, the thermal expansion coeﬃcient for
alloy is similarly underestimated, possibly also due to
imperfections of the structure of the real material.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study we developed MEAM potentials for the
pair combinations of aluminum, silicon, magnesium, copper, and iron. The MEAM formalism allows any of these
potentials to be combined to enable prediction of multicomponent alloy properties. These potentials reproduce a
large body of elemental and binary properties from DFT
calculations at the temperature of 0 K and experimental
results. Basic ﬁnite temperature tests of the single element potentials and their alloy combinations were also
performed. With focus to facilitate reproducibility of
the presented results42, and subject to further testing
and improvements, these potentials are one step towards
designing multi-component alloys by simulations.

Appendix A: MEAM theory
The total energy E of a system of atoms in the MEAM4
is approximated as the sum of the atomic energies
The energy of atom i consists of the embedding energy
and the pair potential terms:
Ei = Fi (¯ρi) + 1
φij (rij) .
F is the embedding function, ¯ρi is the background electron
density at the site of atom i, and φij (rij) is the pair
potential between atoms i and j separated by a distance
rij. The embedding energy Fi (¯ρi) represents the energy
cost to insert atom i at a site where the background
electron density is ¯ρi. The embedding energy is given in
Fi (¯ρi) =
i ¯ρi ln (¯ρi)
if ¯ρi ≥0,
if ¯ρi < 0,
where the sublimation energy E0
i and parameter Ai depend on the element type of atom i. The background
electron density ¯ρi is given by
¯ρi = ρ(0)
if Γ < −1.
The zeroth and higher order densities, ρ(0)
are given in Eqs. (A9). The composition-dependent
electron density scaling ρ0
i is given by
i = ρi0Zi0G
where ρi0 is an element-dependent density scaling, Zi0 is
the ﬁrst nearest-neighbor coordination of the reference
system, and Γref
is given by
where s(k)
is the shape factor that depends on the reference structure for atom i. Shape factors for various
structures are speciﬁed in the work of Baskes 4.
partial electron densities are given by
rijαrijβrijγ
where rijα is the α component of the displacement vector
from atom i to atom j. Sij is the screening function
between atoms i and j and is deﬁned in Eqs. (A16). The
atomic electron densities are computed as
(rij) = ρi0 exp
i is the nearest-neighbor distance in the singleelement reference structure and β(k)
is element-dependent
parameter.
Finally, the average weighting factors are
where t(k)
0,j is an element-dependent parameter.
The pair potential is given by
φij (rij) = ¯φij (rij) Sij
¯φij (rij) =
ij (rij) −Fi
ij (rij) = −Eij
where Eij, αij and r0
ij are element-dependent parameters
and Zij depends upon the structure of the reference system. The background densities ˆρi(rij) in Eq. (A13) are
the densities for the reference structure computed with
interatomic spacing rij.
The screening function Sij is designed so that Sij = 1
if atoms i and j are unscreened and within the cutoﬀ
radius rc, and Sij = 0 if they are completely screened or
outside the cutoﬀradius. It varies smoothly between 0
and 1 for partial screening. The total screening function
is the product of a radial cutoﬀfunction and three body
terms involving all other atoms in the system:
Sij = ¯Sijfc
Cikj −Cmin,ikj
Cmax,ikj −Cmin,ikj
Cikj = 1 + 2
 1 −x)42
Note that Cmin and Cmax can be deﬁned separately for
each i-j-k triplet, based on their element types.
parameter ∆r controls the distance over which the radial
cutoﬀis smoothed from 1 to 0 near r = rc.
Appendix B: Equilibrium lattice parameter and bulk
MEAM postulates the Rose universal equation of
ER(a∗) = −Ec
1 + a∗+ δ αa∗3
for the reference structure of each single element and
for each element pair. The a∗, scaled distance from the
equilibrium nearest neighbor position r0, is
a∗= α(r/r0 −1).
Two δ parameters may be speciﬁed for each element/pair:
δr for negative, and δa for positive a∗. Then
The MEAM potential parameter α is related to the equilibrium atomic volume Ω0, the bulk modulus B0, and the
cohesive energy of the reference structure Ec as follows
The DFT equilibrium energies and bulk moduli were
obtained by ﬁtting energy-volume dependence to Murnaghan equation of state147
E (V ) = E(V0)
Appendix C: Trigonal and tetragonal shear modulus
For small deformations of a cubic crystal, the change
of energy density due to straining is
+ C12 (ϵ1ϵ2 + ϵ2ϵ3 + ϵ3ϵ1)
where ϵi are strains in modiﬁed Voigt notation.
The trigonal shear modulus C44 was determined from
rhombohedral deformation given by ϵ1 = ϵ2 = ϵ3 = 0 and
ϵ4 = ϵ5 = ϵ6 = δ in C1, leading to
△EV (δ) = 3
2C44δ2 + O(δ3).
The tetragonal shear modulus (C11 −C12)/2 was determined from the deformation given by ϵ1 = δ, ϵ2 =
in C1, leading to
△EV (δ) = (C11 −C12) δ2 + O(δ3).
The C2 and C3 were used to estimate tetragonal and
trigonal shear moduli.
