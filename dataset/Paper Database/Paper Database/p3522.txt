Abstract—It is widely acknowledged that the development of
traditional terrestrial communication technologies cannot provide
all users with fair and high quality services due to the scarce
network resource and limited coverage areas. To complement
the terrestrial connection, especially for users in rural, disasterstricken, or other difﬁcult-to-serve areas, satellites, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs), and balloons have been utilized to relay
the communication signals. On the basis, Space-Air-Ground
Integrated Networks (SAGINs) have been proposed to improve
the users’ Quality of Experience (QoE). However, compared
with existing networks such as ad hoc networks and cellular
networks, the SAGINs are much more complex due to the various
characteristics of three network segments. To improve the performance of SAGINs, researchers are facing many unprecedented
challenges. In this paper, we propose the Artiﬁcial Intelligence
(AI) technique to optimize the SAGINs, as the AI technique has
shown its predominant advantages in many applications. We ﬁrst
analyze several main challenges of SAGINs and explain how these
problems can be solved by AI. Then, we consider the satellite
trafﬁc balance as an example and propose a deep learning based
method to improve the trafﬁc control performance. Simulation
results evaluate that the deep learning technique can be an
efﬁcient tool to improve the performance of SAGINs.

achieved in terrestrial communication systems to offer
users Internet access with much higher data rate and lower
latency . The next generation wireless system, 5G, is
announced 20 times faster than 4G with ultra-densely deployed
base stations. However, this does not mean that all users can
enjoy such kind of high quality Internet services at any time
due to the limited network capacities and coverage areas. For
instance, in rural areas which lack the terrestrial high-speed
broadband infrastructure because of the high expense, users
still suffer the narrow-band network access . Moreover,
users in a stadium or participating concerts cannot enjoy stable
Internet service. To address these problems, industry have

made many endeavors, such as the Google’s Project Loon
and Facebook’s Aquila, which provide Internet access through
balloons and drones located in the air, respectively . As
shown in Fig. 1, compared with the ground segment, the air
and space communication systems have much larger coverage,
which have been utilized to provide Internet service to islands,
isolated mountainous areas, as well as the disaster areas.
However, different from the ground networks, the air networks and space networks have their own shortcomings.
Users of satellite communication systems have to tolerate
the long propagation latency, while the air networks have
limited capacity and unstable links. Moreover, both the two
networks are of high mobility. On the other hand, the terrestrial
networks have the highest throughput and most resource. As
the three networks at different altitudes can complement each
other, researchers proposed the integrated network termed
Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) as shown in
Fig. 1 to provide users with improved and ﬂexible end to end
services . It can be found that the SAGIN is a hierarchical
network, with the satellites at the top, the unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs), balloons, and airships in the air, and the
ground segment. Notice that the space segment consists of
the satellites, constellations, as well as the corresponding
terrestrial infrastructures, such as the ground stations and the
control centers.
Aided by the air and space segments, the SAGIN in
Fig.1 enables the packets generated by the ground nodes to
be transmitted to destinations via multiple paths of various
quality. Therefore, the three heterogeneous networks can offer differential packet transmissions to meet various service
requirements, which is extremely important for the Internet
of Things (IoT) network. Moreover, the multi-layered satellite
communication systems which consists of the Geostationary
Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites, the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)
satellites, and the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, can
utilize the multi-cast and broadcast techniques to improve
the network capacity, which can signiﬁcantly alleviate the
growing trafﬁc burden , . However, the network design
and optimization in SAGIN are facing lots of challenges due to
the inherent characteristics of heterogeneity, self-organization,
and time-variability . To improve the end to end Quality of
Experience (QoE), it would happen frequently that researchers
have to conduct the analysis from all three parts since many
transmission in SAGINs are collaboratively conducted by
the base stations in the ground, the UAVs in the air, and
the satellites in the space. In such case, more factors have

to be considered compared with the same problem in
conventional ground communication systems.
Since the SAGIN is more complex than the current terrestrial networks, we need to consider more efﬁcient techniques
to optimize the SAGIN performance. The Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) technique has always been a hot topic due to
its predominant performance in both industry and academia.
In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning refreshes human beings’ realization of AI technique. Google’s
Alphago and Alphago Zero force humans to realize the fact
that current AI technology can not only master the board
game go even though the complex game is concerned with
2 × 10170 legal positions, but also beat human beings .
Besides the excellent performance in games, deep learning has
also shown overwhelming advantages over human beings in
various industrial applications, such as the disease diagnose,
automatic drive, and industrial control. Moreover, the deep
learning technique has also been utilized in satellites for
many applications, such as the image processing. Furthermore,
researchers have conducted lots of research on the utilization
of deep learning to improve the network performance , .
The deep learning technique is demonstrated to outperform
conventional methods. It should also be noted that current
hardware development has also enabled the deep learning
technique to run successfully on communication infrastructures . Considering all these factors and examples, it is a
perspective direction to adopt the deep learning technique to
optimize the network performance of SAGIN.
In this paper, we consider the deep learning technique to
optimize the performance of SAGIN. We ﬁrst analyze several
urgent problems and challenges which are most related to
the SAGIN performance. Then, we introduce some existing
research on the applications of deep learning. After that, we
give an example to illustrate how to adopt the deep learning
technique to choose paths for the satellite networks. We then
discuss the future directions about the application of deep
learning in SAGINs. Finally, we conclude the whole paper.
II. CHALLENGES
It has been widely acknowledged that current ground networks are facing exponentially increasing trafﬁc generated by
various things connected to the network . The advent of SA-
GIN can signiﬁcantly alleviate the challenge and provide users
with more choices. Since recent developments in the industry
such as SpaceX and the next generation of GEO ﬁxed satellite
systems, have considerably decreased the communication cost
and increased the available capacity , it can be imagined
that the future earth will be surrounded by large volumes of
satellites. Due to the three dimensions and the high mobility
of space segment as well as the air segment, the SAGIN is
much more complex than current ground networks. In this
section, we discuss some challenges which is deeply related
to the SAGIN performance.
Network Control: The control manner of the SAGIN is
one of the most important factors which affect the network
performance directly. The distributed management can reduce
the possibility of bottleneck and response time, while the
cooperative operation among devices increases the network
complexity. On the other hand, the centralized control manner
can simplify the network structure, whilst the response delay
signiﬁcantly affects the network performance. It is reasonable
to assume that both two control manners will be cooperatively
utilized in future SAGIN to increase the network tolerance to
different mistakes. Then, the different control manners lead to
the diversity in other network management algorithms, which
further complicates the network management. Moreover, since

the SAGIN consists of heterogenous networks which are
composed various infrastructure, the network integration signiﬁcantly affects the QoE. Due to the inherent heterogeneity
as well as the high mobility, the management of SAGIN is
exposed to extreme difﬁculties .
Spectrum Management: As we know, the quality of wireless communication is affected by the propagation medium.
Compared with terrestrial networks, the propagation medium
in SAGIN is much more diverse since it is highly variant in
time, frequency, and space. Due to the different impacts of
the propagation medium as well as transmission requirements,
multiple frequency bands are cooperatively utilized in SAGIN
to improve the network performance. Since the propagation
medium of SAGIN is distinctly different from the well studied
terrestrial communication systems and the high variance leads
to the frequent changes, it still needs more endeavors to
manage the spectrum in the SAGIN . Moreover, the channel
resource allocation is still one of the most important factors
to affect the network performance despite of the abundant
research on this topic for ground networks. As mentioned
above, the earth will be surrounded by massive satellites as
well as aerial infrastructure in large volume. As the frequency
bands are already congested, Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
have to consider sharing the same frequency bands for many
different types of communications. For instance, L-band is
extensively utilized for space-ground, space-air, and air-ground
communications. Then, the mutual interference caused by
different communication process utilizing the same channels
or adjacent channels should be considered when optimizing the
SAGIN performance . However, the inherent heterogeneity
and high mobility of SAGIN make the problem more complex,
meaning that more efﬁcient techniques should be considered
compared with that of terrestrial networks.
Energy Management: Different from some devices in the
ground which can be charged or connected to the power at
any time, the aerial and space infrastructure as well as some
IoT sensors cannot be connected to a power station. These
devices are powered by the solar or battery. For instance,
current satellites have solar cells to absorb and convert the
solar energy, and then utilize batteries to save the energy for
usage when moving to the shadow area. To improve the energy
efﬁciency can increase the usage time of the satellites since
the total times of complete charge of battery cells are limited.
However, different from the ground segment which usually just
improves communication mechanisms to save the energy, the
totally different propagation medium, the intense radiation, and
space-variant temperature also affect the energy consumptions
of satellite segments . For the aerial infrastructure, optimizing the energy efﬁciency is more critical than conventional
terrestrial communication system. Moreover, while the power
consumption in terrestrial communication systems are mainly
related to the communication related functions, the majority
power consumption for the aerial segments are to maintain the
aloft and support their mobility . Therefore, the energy
management is a critical but challenging topic for SAGIN.
Routing and Handover Management: Since the SAGIN
is a multi-layer network, there exists multiple paths for most
source and destination pairs. On the one hand, the multiple
paths can be utilized for different types of trafﬁc transmission
for meeting the diverse service requirements. On the other
hand, this increases the difﬁculty in routing strategy design
since the network researchers need to consider the service

Challenges for SAGIN

Each individual segment has its inherent
requirements and tailored techniques and
protocols to cater to those requirements.
Hence, the deep learning based conventional
applications for the individual segments
cannot provide a smart, holistic solution.
Therefore, in this article, we aim to investigate
how to leverage deep learning for the integrated

requirements and the performance of paths in terms of packet
loss rate, end-to-end delay, and throughput . Another challenge for routing design is the high mobility of SAGIN which
leads to uncertainties in locations of mobile devices. Moreover,
the high mobility also results in the frequent handover, which
is a challenge for ensuring the seamless transmissions. As the
SAGIN consists of heterogeneous components and different
segments have various coverage areas, different handover
schemes should be proposed with the properties of corresponding segments considered. For instance, the handover in
UAV-based communication systems should consider the work
states of UAVs since they are often shutdown to save power.
Furthermore, efﬁcient prediction algorithms are also required
due to the location uncertainties .
Security Guarantee: As a cooperative network with open
links and dynamic topologies, SAGIN are facing many security
threatens. Even though the SAGIN is required to offer reliable
and secure communications due to the large amount of sensitive data, it is still difﬁcult to provide high security level, for
which the main reasons are multi-fold. First, the conventional
communication protocols, e.g. TCP/IP, have been revised to
integrate diverse technologies for performance improvement,
which leads to new problems in IP security mechanism. Second, the encryption operations often results in more processing
delay and transmission delay, which may hamper the real-time
communications. And the higher the security level, the more
time it costs. Third, the high mobility of the SAGIN produces
many challenges to the network security. For instance, the
frequent handover makes the secure routing more difﬁcult
to be realized. And the SAGIN becomes more vulnerable to
jamming, which is difﬁcult to be addressed because of the
large coverage area .
III. RELATED RESEARCH ON AI BASED NETWORKING
OPTIMIZATIONS
Similar to the SAGIN, current terrestrial networks also
have the above-mentioned but less complex problems. To
address these problems, the deep learning technique has been
a perspective direction to optimize the network performance
in recent years. And the results have evaluated the advantages
of the deep learning over traditional strategies. In this section,
we make some analysis about the existing research and then
discuss the necessary modiﬁcations for adoption in the SA-
GIN. It should be noted that even though existing proposals
cannot be applied in SAGIN directly, they can provide a solid
foundation for future research.
A. Intelligent Trafﬁc Control
As the network trafﬁc is exponentially increasing, trafﬁc
control is a hot research topic. Our previous work proposed
a deep learning based routing strategy which utilizes the Deep
Belief Architecture (DBA) as shown in Fig. 2(a) to predict the
paths. In the proposal, the input and output of the DBA are the
trafﬁc patterns and the next node, respectively. The simulation
results show that the proposal can signiﬁcantly improve the
network throughput and reduce the average delay per hop. To
enable the deployment of the proposed deep learning based
routing strategy, in , we analyzed the Graphics Processing
Unit (GPU) accelerated Software Deﬁned Routers (SDRs).
Theoretical analysis shows that time cost for training and
running the strategy with GPU is much lower than that with
CPU. Moreover, the SDR architecture also provides more
opportunities to improve the ﬂexibility. Besides the next node
prediction, the deep learning technique is also utilized for the
trafﬁc forecast, which can be adopted for routing design and
following resource allocation .
B. Intelligent Resource Allocation
Resource allocation is an important factor which directly
impacts on the network performance. In current terrestrial
networks, the network resource allocation is usually concerned
with two types of resource: the communication resource including channels and bandwidth, and the computation resource
which consists of the processing power and memory. The
authors of discussed the balance between two conﬂicting
factors: the network cost and users’ mean opinion score
(MOS) to improve the network QoE. In this paper, authors
utilized the deep reinforcement learning technique to change
the cache location of content. Speciﬁcally, the network states
which consists of the transmission rates and cache condition
are utilized as the input of the deep Q-networks shown in
Fig. 2(b). Then, the agent can choose the best action according
to the output Q-values of different actions. Simulation results

demonstrate the agent can ﬁnd the best decision to optimize
the proposed reward function after trial and error. As we
mentioned above, the trafﬁc prediction is usually conducted
for many network management tasks. Our previous work 
proposed a deep learning based partially overlapped channel
assignment strategy for the IoT network. The proposal consists
of two steps: utilize the DBA as shown in Fig. 2(a) to
predict the network trafﬁc in next time interval, then adopt
the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) shown in Fig. 2(c)
to choose the suitable channels according to the predicted
trafﬁc. Since the input of the DBA considers the properties
of the IoT trafﬁc, the prediction accuracy is much higher
than conventional methods, which leads to the performance
improvement of channel assignment.
C. Smart Anomaly Detection
Since future IoT network will be abounded with a large
volume of users’ data, it is critically important to increase the
security and privacy level of corresponding network services.
In existing ground networks, deep learning has also been
studied for improving the network security level. In , the
authors proposed a deep learning based approach to detect
anomalous network activity. In the paper, the deep neural
network (DNN) is adopted to extract the features of users’
activities from the system logs. Then, the feature vectors are
input to the long short-term memory (LSTM) as shown in
Fig. 2(d) to measure the anomaly score. Since the users’ activities are often unpredictable over seconds to hours, authors
in this paper utilized an online unsupervised training fashion to
train the deep learning architectures, by which the models can
adapt to the changing patterns in the data. Simulation results
show that the proposed strategy has very high accuracy rate
and can signiﬁcantly reduce the analyst workloads.
After discussing the deep learning based strategies to solve
various problems in current terrestrial networks, it can be
clearly found that the deep learning technique can be utilized
to optimize the network performance. As shown in Table. I,
we can ﬁnd that the various deep learning architectures as
well as the different training manners enable this technique to
be ﬂexibly adopted in heterogeneous scenarios. On the other
hand, current research is all concentrated on the terrestrial
networks and does not consider the characteristics of future

SAGIN. The heterogeneity of different segments in SAGIN
is an important factor to impact on the network performance
which also leads to more complexity. The inherent requirements of each individual segment as well as the tailored
techniques need to be considered when desinging the deep
learning based algorithms for SAGIN.
IV. CASE STUDY ON DEEP LEARNING AIDED SAGIN
In this section, we take the routing problem as an example
to show how the deep learning can be utilized to optimized
the SAGIN performance. Due to the huge scale of SAGIN as
well as some uncertainties of future aerial and space segments’
structures, in this paper, we just use a simpliﬁed network
structure shown in Fig. 3 as the considered scenario. In the
ﬁgure, we can ﬁnd the hierarchical structure consists of 5
layers. In the space segment, there are 2 GEOs, 6 MEOs,
and 12 LEOs, respectively. The aerial segment is composed of
120 UAVs which get the most applications. Since researchers
have spent most energy in studying the ground segment, the
terrestrial communication technologies are relatively mature.
In this paper, we simplify the ground segments and only
consider the connections between the ground nodes and the
UAVs. And if the ground nodes need to transmit the packets
via the space segments, they will ﬁrst upload the packets to the
UAVs. The total number of ground nodes are 3,200 and they
are evenly distributed. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of the
three segments, it is reasonable to consider that the routing
design follows different strategies in different segments. As
the deep learning technique has been studied to improve the
terrestrial and air segments, in this paper, we focus on the
performance optimization of the satellite network with deep
learning. Since the simulation platform is a workstation with
Intel Core i7-6900K CPU, 64GB Random Access Memory
(RAM), and Nvidia Geforce Titan X GPU, it is reasonable to
just consider the inter-layer links in the layers of GEO and
MEO as well as the links connecting adjacent layers, which
can still demonstrate the advantages of our proposed proofof-concept. The values of main parameters in the considered
topology are given in Table II.
In Fig. 3, the network can be separated into two parts: the
left part and the right part covered by G1 and G2, respectively.
Even though there are lots of simultaneous communication
process in the SAGIN, we only focus on the packets generated
by the ground nodes in the left part and destined for the ground
nodes in the right part via the satellite networks. Therefore,
the ground nodes are evenly separated into two groups: 1,600

source nodes in the left part and 1,600 destination nodes in
the right part. We consider various number of source nodes
which need to transmit packets to the destination nodes to
change the trafﬁc load of the space segment. For each source
node communicating with the destination nodes, its packet
generation rate is 2Mbps. According to Fig. 3, the interlayer connections in the MEO and GEO satellites enable
these packets to be transmitted to the right part via multiple
paths. For instance, the packets in M1 destined for M5 can be
transmitted via M2 and M4, or via G1 and G2. As the long
propagation delay caused by the distances among satellites
deteriorates the performance seriously, the physical distance
is one of the most important metrics impacting on the routing
design. Therefore, according to the conventional shortest path
(SP) algorithm, the path via the MEO satellites usually has
higher priority over that through the GEO satellites due to the
less distance. However, this actually does not lead to better
performance, especially when M1, M2, and M3 all have heavy
trafﬁc towards the right section. If we consider the periodical
bursty trafﬁc as shown in , the MEO satellites connecting
two parts, M2, M3, M4, and M6, will be congested frequently.
On the other hand, if the satellites can learn the rules according
to the trafﬁc patterns, the MEO satellites can transfer some
trafﬁc to GEO satellites for the trafﬁc balance. Here, we
consider the deep learning technique to reach this goal.
We consider the origin-destination (OD) pair which consists
of a MEO satellite in the left part and right part denoting
the origin and destination, respectively. Since multiple paths
exist for every OD pair, we consider the path combinations,
C, each of which consists of one path for every OD pair. We
utilize CNNi to represent the path combination CNNi and the
output of CNNi means that the path combination should be
chosen or not. Speciﬁcally, the input of a CNN is the trafﬁc
pattern and the remaining buffer size of MEO satellites and
GEO satellites. The output is a vector composed of two binary
elements, where (1, 0) represents the path combination should
be chosen, otherwise (0, 1) means not. We utilize the online
training method to train the considered CNNs . The main
parameters of the utilized CNN are shown in Table II.
Figs. 4 give the results of our proposal and the conventional
SP method in terms of network throughput and packet loss
rate. In Fig. 4a, we can ﬁnd the throughput of our proposal
linearly increases with the growth of the source nodes’ number
when the number of source nodes is less than 1,200. For
the conventional SP strategy, the value of network throughput
is nearly the same as that of our proposal and also linearly
increases at the beginning. However, when the number of
source nodes is above 800, the network throughput of conventional strategy increases gradually slowly and nearly keeps
a constant value after the source nodes are more than 1,000.
Therefore, we can ﬁnd our proposal can achieve much higher
throughput than the conventional strategy when the source
nodes’ number is more than 800. Fig. 4b shows the packet
loss rate of two networks. It can be easily found that the two
strategies nearly have the same performance when the source
nodes are less than 700. However, after that, the packet loss
rate of conventional strategy increases very fast, which means
that the network running conventional strategy is congested
when there are more than 700 source nodes and the congestion
becomes more seriously with the growth of source nodes.
For the deep learning based routing strategy, the network
can still transfer all the packets to destinations before the
number of source nodes increases above 1,100. After that,
our proposal also lose some packets. We can conclude that
compared with the conventional strategy, our proposal can
signiﬁcantly improve the network performance. The reason for
improvement of our proposal is that the utilized deep learning
architecture can learn the experiences from trafﬁc patterns and
transfer some packets via GEO satellites when some MEO
satellites are nearly congested. On the other hand, in the
network running conventional strategy, the MEO satellites are
always ﬁrst chosen for packet transmission, which leads to
frequent trafﬁc congestion in the MEO satellites.
V. FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Deep learning is a promising technique to optimize the
SAGIN performance since its efﬁciency and ﬂexibility enable
it to be a prospective paradigm to promote the SAGIN to
a higher level. On the basis of current achievements, future
research can be conducted in following four aspects.
Architecture Construction: When designing the deep learning based proposal, the ﬁrst challenge is to construct the deep
IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. XX, NO. XX, JULY 2018
learning architecture. As there are so many deep learning
architectures of which each can be utilized for different
applications, it is still tough even for an experienced researcher
to choose the suitable structure. Moreover, the input and output
design of the architecture is deeply concerned with the studied
problems and impacts on the prediction accuracy as well as
the computation overhead. Considering more factors usually
means not only much higher accuracy rate but also the increased training and running time. Furthermore, as the SAGIN
is a multi-dimensional network which is more complex than
current terrestrial networks, how to design the corresponding
deep learning architectures still needs more consideration.
Proposal Deployment: As we mentioned above, the long
latency of the space communication system is a serious
shortcoming for the SAGIN. When we deploy deep learning
based proposals, if we consider the centralized control manner, the computation time cost as well as the transmission
latency between the controller and the controlled devices will
deteriorate the network performance. However, the distributed
control is not always a good choice for any scenario, especially
when the input of deep learning architecture is concerned with
the whole network. Therefore, the distributed control manner
often means increased signaling overhead caused by necessary
information exchange. Moreover, the device computation requirement in the distributed network is much higher because
every device needs to run the deep learning based method.
Computation Efﬁciency: Since the deep learning technique is usually concerned with much more computation
consumption than conventional methods, when considering
the deep learning technique to optimize the SAGIN performance, it is necessary to improve the computation efﬁciency.
The computation efﬁciency is concerned with many factors,
such as the required accuracy rate, the training strategy, the
computation hardware, and so on. In most cases, increasing
the number of layers can improve the accuracy rate, but
also leads to increased computation consumption. Therefore,
when designing the deep learning architectures, we need
to consider the accuracy requirement and try our best to
simplify the architectures. Many other techniques to improve
the computation efﬁciency should also be considered, such as
utilizing the parameters of existing deep learning architectures
for initialization. Furthermore, the ofﬂine training manner
can reduce the computation overhead during running phase,
while the online training fashion enables the deep learning
architecture to easily adapt to the changing patterns.
Hardware Design: To deploy the deep learning based
strategies, we also need to make some modiﬁcations on current
communication hardware. It is common that the GPU is more
suitable for deep learning computation since it can efﬁciently
handle the matrix computations. Thus, if we adopt the deep
learning technique to optimize the SAGIN performance, it is
important to equip enough GPU resource in current network
infrastructure. At the same time, the cooperation among the
different computation resource as well as the computation task
scheduling also need to be studied. Moreover, the hardware
expense should be also considered to improve the cost performance ratio, especially for the space communication systems.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we study the deep learning technique to
optimize the SAGIN performance. Firstly, we discuss several
challenges which directly impact on the network performance.
Then, we give some analysis about existing deep learning
based research to improve the terrestrial network performance
and also explain the shortcomings of these proposals for future
SAGIN. To show how the deep learning technique can improve
the SAGIN performance, we give an example which utilizes
the CNN to choose the path combinations for the satellite
communication system. Since applying the AI technique in
SAGIN is still a new topic, we also discuss some future
promising directions.
