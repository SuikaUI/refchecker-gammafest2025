Abstract: The terrestrial impact crater record is commonly assumed to be biased, with
erosion thought to eliminate older craters, even on stable terrains. Given that the same
projectile population strike the Earth and Moon, terrestrial selection effects can be
quantified using a method that can date diameter ≥ 10 km lunar craters younger than 1
Gyr. We find the impact rate increased by a factor of 2.6 about 290 million years ago.
The terrestrial crater record shows similar results, suggesting the deficit of large
terrestrial craters between 300 and 650 million years ago stems from a lower impact flux,
not preservation bias. The almost complete absence of terrestrial craters older than 650
million years may indicate a massive global-scale erosion event near that time.
One Sentence Summary: An analysis of lunar and terrestrial craters reveals that a
substantial increase in larger impacts began about 290 million years ago.
Main Text: The abundance of terrestrial craters with diameter ≥ 20 km decreases
substantially as we go back in time. A common assumption is that this loss is driven by
erosive and tectonic processes operating over hundreds of millions of years (Myr).
Unfortunately, it is challenging to quantitatively test this hypothesis with existing
terrestrial data. An alternative is to estimate terrestrial crater loss rates by comparing
Earth’s crater record to the Moon’s. The Earth and Moon have been struck by the same
impactor population over time, but large lunar craters have experienced limited
degradation over billions of years. The main obstacle to performing this test has been
finding an accurate way to date large lunar craters.
An analysis of the thermophysical characteristics of lunar impact ejecta as
measured by the Diviner thermal radiometer on NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter
(1, 2) has now provided the means to estimate the ages of diameter > 10 km craters
younger than 1 Gyr. The formation of large lunar craters excavates numerous ≥1 m
ejecta fragments onto the Moon’s surface. These newly exposed rocks have high thermal
inertia and remain warm during the lunar night relative to the surrounding lunar soils
(called regolith) with low thermal inertia. Their nighttime temperatures can be calculated
from three of Diviner’s thermal infrared channels. Rock abundance values, defined as the
fractional coverage of a Diviner pixel by exposed meter-scale rocks (Fig. 1), are obtained,
simultaneously with rock-free lunar regolith temperatures, by exploiting the fact that a
mixture of lunar rocks and regolith produces a mixed spectral radiance and therefore
different estimates of brightness temperature in each of the three thermal infrared
channels (1).
Using these data, an inverse relationship between rock abundance in large crater
ejecta and crater age has been demonstrated by calculating ejecta rock abundance values
for nine “index” craters with independently determined ages (2). Young craters are found
to have high rock abundance in their ejecta, whereas rock abundance decreases with
increasing crater age, eventually becoming indistinguishable from the background for
craters older than ~1 Gyr. The breakdown of lunar rocks has most likely occurred at a
steady rate over the last billion years via the constant influx of tiny impactors and the
thermal effects of lunar day-night cycling (3). We derive a crater age-rock abundance
regression function shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 (3).
We identified 111 rocky craters on the Moon with diameter ≥ 10 km between 80º
N and 80º S, with ejecta blankets that have rock abundance values high enough to
distinguish them from the background regolith (Fig. 2a, Table S1). We use the 95th
percentile rock abundance values (RA95/5), which are those that separate the upper 5%
from the lower 95% of RA values for a given crater’s ejecta. We chose 10 km as a
minimum size for this analysis because those craters have penetrated the surface regolith
deeply enough to excavate large blocks from the underlying bedrock. This approach
minimizes the influence of variations in original ejecta block population due to spatial
variations in surface soil thickness (4, 5).
Using Fig. 1, we calculated ages for these craters and found that they were not
formed uniformly with time (Fig. 2b). This implies the small and large body impact
fluxes striking the Moon are probably decoupled from one another at a modest level, with
small impactors more likely to maintain a steady impact flux than large impactors (3) (see
Fig. S2). Our analysis also showed no statistical evidence for a leading versus trailing
hemisphere asymmetry in the calculated ages of these large craters, nor for a latitudinal
dependence in rocky crater abundance, though our relatively small sample size might
make such a trend difficult to detect. We also identified no correlation between crater
sizes and crater ages, meaning differently sized craters are randomly distributed in time.
To quantify the change in flux exhibited by these lunar craters, we adopted a
piecewise-constant rate model in which a uniform cratering rate at early times changes
instantaneously to a different rate at later times. Sampling from among all possible values
of the crater age-rock abundance regression parameters, using conservative estimates on
the lunar index crater ages (Fig. 1) (3), we found that this model shows statistical
evidence for a break at some time between 220 and 770 Myr (95% credible intervals),
with the peak of the marginalized probability density function (PDF) at a break age of
400 Myr (Fig. S1). The ratio of the crater rate after the break age to the pre-break rate is
2.1, with 95% credible interval values of 1.4-20.6.
Supporting evidence for a factor of 2 to 3 increase in the lunar impact flux since
~400 Myr may come from the ages and abundances of lunar impact spherules. Created by
energetic cratering events, these glassy melt droplets have been identified in the regolith
samples returned from the Apollo landing sites. Their age distribution is a potential proxy
for the impact flux of larger bodies and it suggests the impact flux increased by a factor
of 3.7 ± 1.2 over the last 400 Myr (6, 7), in broad agreement with our results. However,
the abundance of young impact spherules found in Apollo lunar regolith samples could
be a bias (e.g., 7). Lunar craters formed over the last 300-400 Myr may have also
degraded faster via diffusion processes than those that formed between 700-3100 Myr
(8). This observation may be explained if large impacts enhance diffusive processes via,
e.g., seismic shaking, and the large body impact flux has increased over recent times.
Rayed lunar craters have previously been used to compute impact flux rates, with
the assumption often made that they formed in the last 1 Gyr. We find 11 farside rocky
craters with D ≥ 20 km formed in the last 1 Gyr, compared to 28 to 32 farside rayed
craters assumed to be this age (9, 10). This discrepancy suggests rayed craters may have
a much wider spread of ages than commonly thought (see Supplementary Text).
These results for the Moon provide insights into Earth’s crater record.
Interpretation of the terrestrial record is problematic because: (i) an unknown number of
older craters have been erased at unknown times by erosion or tectonics, (ii) stable
continental surfaces capable of recording ancient impacts have potentially been buried
and exhumed multiple times since they formed, (iii) it is difficult to precisely quantify
which terrains have been adequately searched for craters, and (iv) not all craters are
exposed at the surface, but instead have to be identified through geophysical anomalies
and explored through drilling (e.g., 11).
Lunar craters have experienced comparatively little erosion over the last 1 Gyr,
and the proximity of the Earth to the Moon implies that both have been struck by the
same population of impactors. A comparison of records on both bodies therefore provides
an opportunity to quantify terrestrial selection effects.
Contrary to our expectation, we find that the size-frequency distributions of the
lunar and terrestrial craters for diameter ≥ 20 km, normalized by the total number of
craters, are highly similar (Fig. S3a). We find no evidence for size bias in retention of
terrestrial craters; in an average sense, for a given region, it appears the Earth either keeps
all or loses all of its D ≥ 20 craters at the same rate, independent of size.
We compared the ages of the 38 known terrestrial diameter D ≥ 20 km craters
(Table S2) with the computed age distribution for lunar craters with ≥ 10 km and ≥ 20 km
(Table S1) (Fig. 3). Using the same statistical method for the terrestrial craters as for the
lunar craters, we find that the terrestrial craters also have a break age and present-day to
past crater rate ratio close to lunar values (Fig. S1). As there is evidence for a non-
uniform terrestrial cratering rate similar to the lunar cratering rate, and considering that
the Earth and Moon share a similar bombardment history, we combined both records.
The inclusion of terrestrial craters provides an absolute age chronology supplement to the
nine index craters we have for the Moon.
The model adopted to fit these data includes a single break between two uniform
rates, but we do not rule out other simple models (e.g., cratering rate linearly increasing
in time) or more complex models (e.g., multiple breaks). Rather, we use the single-break
piecewise model as a simple and physically plausible hypothesis to demonstrate that the
lunar and terrestrial cratering rates have not been constant over the past billion years.
Our joint lunar and terrestrial analysis yields a ratio of the crater rate after the
break age to the pre-break rate of 2.6, with a 95% credible interval value of 1.7-4.7. The
most probable break age is 290 Myr. The impact rate change is reflected in the size-
frequency distribution curves, with craters younger than 290 Myr substantially higher in
frequency at all diameters than those older than 290 Myr (Fig. 2b). The deficit of large
terrestrial craters between 290-650 Myr can therefore be interpreted to reflect a lower
impact flux relative to the present day and not a bias (Supplementary Text).
The erosion history of Earth’s continents can also be constrained using uranium-
lead (U-Pb) thermochronology, or temperature-sensitive radiometric dating.
Thermochronologic data suggest stable continental terrains experience low erosion or
burial rates of up to 2.5 m Myr-1 (12), which equates to a maximum of 1.6 km vertical
erosion (or deposition) over the last 650 Myr. This would likely be insufficient to
eradicate ≥ 20 km craters, given that crater depths are approximately equal to ~10% of
their original diameter (13).
Support for limited erosion on cratered terrains can also be found in the record of
kimberlite pipes. Kimberlites are formed during explosive volcanism from deep mantle
sources, generating carrot-shaped pipes 1-2 km deep (14, 15) (Fig. 4), and commonly
preserve volcanic features (e.g. volcanic craters, pipes) that are depth-diagnostic (16).
Impact craters and kimberlites are frequently found in common regions on stable
continental surfaces (Fig. 4a), so kimberlites are a proxy indicating the depth of erosion
for surfaces of different ages. Deep erosion of stable continental surfaces (>2 km) should
have removed most kimberlite pipes, leaving behind deep-seated intrusive rocks, but
kimberlite pipes are relatively common throughout the Phanerozoic Eon (541 million
years ago to the present). Their spatio-temporal distribution (Fig. 4b) suggests only
modest erosion (<1 km) on most cratons since 650 Myr, favoring the survival of ≥ 20 km
impact craters (3).
There is a sharp cut-off in the number of terrestrial craters at ~650 Myr (Figs. 3-
4). Given erosion rates on stable continental terrains after 650 Myr, similar conditions
further back in time would have allowed most craters of Precambrian age (i.e., older than
541 Myr) to survive. Instead, the paucity of Precambrian craters is coincident with major
episodes of globally extensive ‘Snowball Earth’ glaciation (17) (Fig. 4b). Pervasive
subglacial erosion at ~650–720 Myr is thought to have removed kilometers of material
from the continents (18, 19), enough to erase most existing kimberlite pipes and impact
craters (Fig. S5a). The exceptions are the > 130 km impact craters Sudbury (1850 Myr)
and Vredefort . Both craters were deep enough to survive, but each shows
indications of multiple kilometers of erosion (20).
The change in the lunar and terrestrial impact flux may be due to the breakup of
one or more large asteroids in the inner and/or central main asteroid belt (e.g., 21). Those
located near dynamical resonances may produce long-lived surges in the impact flux as
the fragments are slowly driven to escape routes by non-gravitational forces. Asteroid
evolution models suggest the contribution of kilometer-sized impactors from a large
parent body disruption would have reached their new level within a few tens of Myr of
the breakup event(s), with the wave of bodies perhaps receding after hundreds of Myr

Rock cover is defined as materials with rock-like thermal inertia and minimum diameters
larger than the diurnal thermal skin depth (~0.5 m). This regression differs from previous
analysis (2) due to use of an updated rock abundance dataset and an updated age for
Aristarchus crater (23), together with a statistical treatment that marginalizes over
unacknowledged uncertainties for the published crater ages (3). Red error bars illustrate
uncertainties for each crater, and black error bars show the uncertainties implied by the

The best fitting parameters in the relation RA95/5 = a × (age / Myr)b are a: 0.33; b: -0.50
(black solid curve); black dashed and dotted curves show the 68% and 95% credible
intervals. After propagation through the joint terrestrial/ lunar Approximate Bayesian
Computation rejection (ABCr) analysis (3), the best fitting parameters are a: 0.34; b: -
0.51 (cyan solid curve); cyan dashed and dotted curves show the 68% and 95% credible
intervals. Inset figures show the 2D distribution of the posterior PDF sample of
parameters (a, b) before and after ABCr analysis (black and cyan points, respectively),
their marginalized distributions, and p(c), the 1D marginalized posterior PDF of the
uncertainty scaling factor c (Equation S2).
Fig. 2. Geographic and size-frequency distribution of rocky lunar craters. (A)
Geographic distribution of 111 rocky (young) craters with diameter D ≥ 10 km between
80°N and 80°S on the Moon (listed in Table S1), scaled by size and color coded
according to age. Orange (dark yellow deuteranopia): craters younger than 290 Myr; pink
(light blue deuteranopia): 290-580 Myr; dark blue: 580-870 Myr; yellow: 870-1160 Myr;
white: older than 1160 Myr. Background image is from the 2013 LROC WAC global
mosaic ( (B) Cumulative size-frequency distributions of
craters: red: average SFD of craters older than 290 Myr (55 craters; average of
cumulative distribution in three age bins: 290-580 Myr; 580-870 Myr; and 870-1160
Myr); black: craters younger than 290 Myr (56 craters), error bars show Poisson noise.
The lunar cratering rate has increased by a factor of 2.6 in the last 290 Myr compared to
the preceding ~710 Myr.
Fig. 3. Age-frequency distributions of lunar and terrestrial craters. The lunar D ≥ 10
and 20 km curves are shown by the black line, while D ≥ 20 km terrestrial craters (Table
S2) are shown with the red line. All terrestrial craters are younger than 650 Myr. The
lunar impact flux increases by a factor of 2.6 near 290 Myr (Fig. S1). A simple piecewise
model (cyan) demonstrates the break between two rates compared to a simple uniform
model (dashed black). The similarity between the lunar and terrestrial distributions
suggests that the inferred increase in terrestrial impacts is not a preservation bias.

Fig. 4. Positions of terrestrial impact craters and kimberlites in space and time. (A)
Locations of all impact craters identified in the Planetary and Space Science Centre
(PASSC) Earth Impact Database (24), scaled by size and colored by age. Kimberlite
occurrences are also shown; solid symbols denote those with well-defined ages (n = 624)
and white diamonds show undated kimberlites (n = 3645) (25). Gray regions correspond
to major exposures of Precambrian basement rocks (26), which together with platform
areas shown in beige (27) form the stable cratons, where 84% of D ≥ 20 km craters (and
84.6% of D ≥ 10 km craters) occur. (B) Chronology of large impacts (>10 km) and well-
dated kimberlites for each continent, excluding Antarctica. Colored symbols signify
depth-diagnostic kimberlite zones (labeled and illustrated in the inset). There is an abrupt
cut-off in impact crater and kimberlite pipe frequency at ~650 Myr, coincident with
Snowball Earth glaciation during the Cryogenian Period, 720 to 635 million years ago
