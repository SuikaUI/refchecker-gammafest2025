Introduction
Artificial
intelligence
technologies
increasingly prevalent in different organizations and
society sectors, one of these sectors is healthcare.
Where, these technologies have the ability to make
transformation on many aspects of patient care, in
addition to administrative processes within provider,
pharmaceutical
organizations.
complexity and rise of data in healthcare operations
means that artificial intelligence will increasingly be
applied within this field. The main categories of
applications
 . On the other hand,
to achieve a competitive advantage in the labor
market, there is a need to radical change to digitalize
healthcare
artificial
intelligence has succeeded to grasp the attention of
key healthcare top managers and providers who are
currently experiencing a dilemma of whether or not to
fully or partially integrate it into their work 
Artificial intelligence refers broadly to computing
technologies which resemble processes related to
human intelligence, as reasoning, adaptation and
learning, sensory understanding and interaction
 . The developing use
cases of artificial intelligence in the sector of
healthcare might be shown as technologies collection
which enable machines to perceive, understand, act
and learn in order to carry out healthcare
administrative and clinical functions, in addition to be
enrolled in research and for clinical learning
activities. For the last time, Artificial intelligence has
increased productivity and its extensive widespread
into daily life is increasing at a rapid pace . Due to the old infrastructure in several
countries and the need for extra bed numbers in other
countries, hospital managers and governments have
to think again carefully for the best way to enhance
inpatient environments and outpatient environments
incorporate
technologies into traditional care like telemedicine
and telenursing to actually form a healthcare system

In addition to offering an insight into an enhanced
and improved digital future, the rapid introduction of
(AI) into the healthcare system has also created
serious concerns about this evolution social and
ethical consequences. Nursing managers play a very
important role in advocating for the objective and the
most effective use of AI health solutions. To
accomplish this role and duty, nurses need to be
informed on the extensive spread of AI and the effect
of development, deployment and evaluation of these
technologies 
Throughout the present of COVID-19 (Coronavirus)
pandemic, the medical organizations are searching for
novel technologies to control and monitor the
pandemic spread. Artificial intelligence is one of
technology that could simply control coronavirus
spread, by identifying patients with high-risk, it also
very useful in controlling the spread of this infection
in real-time. AI has the capability also to expect the
risk of mortality by analyzing patient's previous
history effectively. It also very important in fighting
the virus by screening of the population, notification,
medical help, and infection control suggestions
 , Bai, et al., & Hu, et
al., . This new trend also has the possibility to
enhance planning, treatment and reported outcomes
of the COVID-19 patient.
Some uses of artificial intelligence which could be
used in nursing information systems are monitoring
client’ information, helping to remember patient data,
reporting forms, managing quality and minimizing
hospitalization time, enhancing care efficacy and
performing interventions in its correct time, cost
documentation of patient information. There are
many barriers facing successful AI-based decision
support systems for nursing as implementation of any
technology is facing barriers, these barriers and
challenges are technology limitations, the elevated
costs of the system, and the continuous updates
 .
As Egypt has become a safer place to live and do
business and realizing Egypt's vision 2030 the
country has started to embrace artificial intelligence
& technology in different sectors. The government
has gotten more aggressive in sparking the AI growth
through initiatives aimed at fostering research and
development within their borders. Towards an
Egyptian society powered by AI & robotics, a public
goal was set by the government of 7.7% of Egyptian
Gross Domestic Product to be derived from AI &
robotics by 2030 .
Significance of the study
Health organizations must respond rapidly to
changing technology, regulation, and customer
demands in the rapid transition in healthcare.
Artificial intelligence can assist in proactive patient
care, decreased future risk, and streamlined work
processes. The advancement of artificial intelligence
technology to additional adoption and value across
healthcare is perpetuated by cost, quality, and care
outcomes. Computer systems help also to analyze
large amounts of data efficiently and assist instruction
 . The researchers think no one attempt
to study nurses’ perception and attitudes toward
artificial
intelligence
technology
University Hospitals So, the aim of present study was
to investigate the perception and attitudes of nursing
artificial
intelligence
technology in health settings at Mansoura University
Hospitals.
Aim of the study:
The study aim is to investigate nurse managers’
perspectives and attitudes toward using artificial
intelligence technology in health settings at Mansoura
University Hospitals.

(Agree) and 5 (Strongly Agree). The questionnaire
consists of two parts: 1st part is demographic data of
studied sample as gender, age, type of job, and the
educational level. 2nd part consists of 14 items with
three dimensions, the first dimension, perception
towards AI contains (4) items. The second dimension,
the advantages of using AI includes (5) items. The
dimension,
application of AI in healthcare included (5) items.
Scoring System:
Based on cut of value 40%. The nurse managers’
perception is determined as low ≤ 40, moderate 41-≤
80 and high ≥ 81
Tool (II): General attitudes towards artificial
intelligence questionnaire, adapted from Schepman
& Rodway . And aims to assess the general
attitudes toward AI through five point Likert scale
ranged from 1-5, 1 (Strongly Disagree), 2 (Agree), 3
(Neutral), 4 (Agree) and 5 (Strongly Agree).
Scoring System: Based on cut of value 60%. The
nurse managers’ attitude is determined as negative ≤

Validity and reliability:
Face and content validity of the study tools were
tested by five experts in the field of Nursing
Administration to evaluate the items as well as the
entire instruments as being relevant, comprehensive
and appropriate to test what they wanted to measure
and modifications were done. The study tools were
tested to assess reliability via the pilot subjects and
Cronbach’s alpha test was 0.879 for first tool and
0.899 for the second tool.
Pilot study:
A pilot study was applied on 10% (13 nurses) from
nurses’ managers at Mansoura University Hospitals to
investigate the clarity and applicability of tools and to
determine the time needed to fill in questions. The
pilot study was excluded from study sample.
Field work:
The researchers introduced themselves to the study
sample, explained the aim of the study, and how to
fill in the questionnaire, approval was taken orally
and asked them for their cooperation with them. The
researchers met the study sample either individually
or groups during shifts to distribute the questionnaires
during these meetings. The study sample filled in the
tools individually at once and some of them read the
questionnaires and fixed another time to fill them,
filling the questionnaire sheet acquired from 20-30
minutes. The researchers were available during data
collection to answer any question from the study
sample. The data collection process started from the
beginning of September to the end of November,

Discussion
Artificial intelligence is already present in healthcare.
It could be used in the support of clinical decision
management
engagement, and organizational enhancements. Many
organizations will use it by 2020, as this technology
continues to be made readily accessible for every
person. That said, healthcare organizations may face
several challenges as they begin to deploy AI
 . Technology perceptions
and attitudes are significant factors that may hinder
the uptake and success of its implementation.
However, there is a lack of studies whether there is a
measurable difference in perceptions and attitudes
toward the technology among health care staff. So,
this study aims to assess the level of the nurse
managers’ attitudes and perception toward using
artificial intelligence technology in health settings at
Mansoura University Hospitals.
The results of the present study revealed that there is
significant
managers’ demographic characteristics (years of
experience, job, education and work position) and
their attitudes toward using AI except gender and age.
This result may be related to the global trend
regarding the existence of the Corona pandemic
showed the need to use AI to reduce the rate of
infection spread. Also, all health settings are trying to
use AI in different nursing settings. which makes a
link between the attitudes of nursing managers
(Decision maker) towards the use of AI in different
workplaces, especially at the present time. In addition
to the correlation of the level of education, years of
experience, and the awareness of those with high
level of education and experience of the need for AI
and technology in health settings to be in line with the
global trend.
These findings were consistent with the study by
IJsebaert, entitled attitudes towards robots
and Artificial Intelligence at work in 22 European
countries and revealed that education has a significant
positive effect on robots and AI attitudes at work.
Also, it showed that age is a weak factor to make
variation in robots and AI attitudes at work. Older
adults make new strategies to avoid using of
technologies and robots and consequently are less
likely to be positive towards them. Also, Elias, et al
., mentioned that age is seen as a significant
element to consider when addressing workplace
technology and older workers are less eager to adapt,
less able to training and less able to understand new
concepts that have a negative effect on managers and
employees ' behavior.
The finding of the present study revealed that there is
a significant positive relation between job, education
and workplace of nurse managers’ demographic
characteristics and their perception toward using
artificial intelligence. This result may be related to
job, education and workplace are the most important
environmental stimuli that affect the way the person
think and his impression about anything. Which in
turns affect the person’ perception. This result is in
line with Cherry, who mentioned that
perception is considered the sensory experience of the
Perception
recognizing
environmental stimuli and actions as a result of these
stimuli. The whole thing in the environment that has
the possibility to be perceived is called environmental
In the same line this result is supported by the study
of Abdullah, entitled “Health care employees’
perception of the use of artificial intelligence
application: survey study” and mentioned that no
significant differences in employees’ perception and
educational level.
The result of the present study mentioned that there is
a highly significant positive correlation between nurse
managers’ perception and attitudes toward using
artificial intelligence in nursing settings. This result
may be related to the new trend of Egyptian hospital
for application of Artificial intelligence in various
workplaces as response to Egypt’ vision 2030.
According to this vision Egypt started to embrace
artificial intelligence & technology in all society
sectors. One of this critical sector is health. On the
other hand, nurse managers are considered the
decision maker inside their workplace which gives
them the responsibility to achieve the new trend of
their workplace and take decisions that go in line.
The result of the current study showed that nurse
managers reported their high mean score for
perception of advantage toward using artificial
intelligence, followed by the problems concerning
artificial intelligence application in healthcare. This
result may be related to the extent to which nursing
managers are aware of the importance and advantages
of using AI in nursing settings, especially at the
present time, as the existence of the Corona virus.
Which is considered a global epidemic threatening
the whole world, especially health personnel, and one
of the most important advantages of AI is that it helps
accelerate health care process, decrease medical
errors and deliver real time, clinically relevant,
massive amounts of high-quality data. On the other
hand, the more critical problem for application of
artificial intelligence is that the ability of artificial
intelligence to sympathize and understand the
patient's emotional well-being is low, which consider
the base for dealing with patient and has a significant
role for quality of patient care.
This finding disagreed with the study held by
Assiut Scientific Nursing Journal
Elsayed & Sleem
Vol , (9) No, (24), Supplement March, 2021, pp (182-192)
concerning artificial intelligence application in
healthcare gained the high score followed by
advantage toward using artificial intelligence. In the
same point of view with the study done by Carrol,
“artificial
intelligence,
thinking and the nursing process” mentioned that
applications and benefits of artificial intelligence to
nurses in care delivery environments are still vague.
Regarding the attitude of nurse managers toward
using artificial intelligence, the present findings
revealed that artificial Intelligence is exciting gained
the high mean score distribution of nurse managers’
attitude followed by artificial intelligence can offer
new economic opportunities for my organization.
This finding may be related to the ability of artificial
intelligence in transforming the level of health care.
Artificial intelligence has a various roles in health
care delivery process as, using AI approaches to
analyses un-structured data as images, videos, doctors
notes to help in decision making in clinical settings;
using AI can improve patient engagement and
treatment compliance; and predictive modeling to
deal with patient flow and hospital capacity and
resource availability, AI programs that help in
predicting, diagnosing and diseases treatment or
management of which in turn help improvement of
care and reducing workload.
This result was supported by , who
mentioned that AI has the ability to change the
delivery of healthcare. A new study with the
European Union’s EIT Health discussed how it can
improve care outcomes, the experience of clients and
accessibility
healthcare
Artificial
intelligence may improve care delivery productivity
and efficacy also it can help healthcare systems to
offer more and better care to additional categories of
people. AI will help enhance healthcare practitioners'
experience, helping them to focus extra time on direct
patient care and decreasing burnout.
Regarding the level of nurse managers’ perception
toward using artificial intelligence the present study
revealed that more than three-quarters of studied
sample had a moderate level of perception. This result
may be due to artificial intelligence has become of
great importance nowadays due to the tendency of the
health sector to use it in its various fields and seeks to
provide the necessary information on how to apply it
in line with Egypt' Vision 2030 that aims to
digitization all society sectors.
This result goes in line with Abdullah, who
mentioned in his study that the overall perception of
health care employees toward AI was moderate.
On the other hand, this result disagreed with
Mehdipour, in study entitled “Nursing
Artificial
Intelligence
Decisions”,
mentioned that the level of application of Artificial
Intelligence awareness for the majority of nursing
managers in nursing was very high.
In the same line Alamanova, in study entitled
“The Perception of Artificial Intelligence and Other
Technological Innovations among Human Resources
Specialists”. He mentioned that HR professionals
enthusiastic
minimizing
workloads while being skeptical about adding
unnecessary functionality to computing machines also
they possess different feelings about AI than they do
technologies.
professionals have concerns about technology pricing
and interfaces in addition to electronic HR
management applications.
The current study showed that more than half of nurse
managers had positive attitude toward using AI in
nursing setting. This result may be related to
implementation of AI in nursing settings leads to
productivity, decrease medical errors, give more
chances for nurse to spend more time with direct
patient care and decrease workload.
This finding was in line with Sarwar, et al., 
who mentioned that pathologist respondents had
positive attitudes toward Artificial Intelligence, with
almost three- quarters were excited or interested in
using AI as a diagnostic tool for enhancing efficiency
and quality efficiency in pathology workflows and
also, expected AI technology introduction into the
pathology laboratory in the future. In addition to
Mehdipour, who mentioned that the majority
of nursing managers attitude towards application of
AI systems in nursing was positive.
Conclusion
In the light of our study findings, it was concluded
that the highest percent mean score was related to
perception of advantage toward using artificial
intelligence, followed by the problems concerning
artificial intelligence application in healthcare. The
majority of studied sample had a moderate level of
perception with positive attitude toward artificial
intelligence. There is a highly significant positive
correlation between nurse managers’ perception and
attitude toward using AI in nursing settings.
Conflict of interest
The authors declare that they have no conflict of
