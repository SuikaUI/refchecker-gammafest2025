In the introduction

the plan of papers

the general theory has been
in many directions,
and our original plans have had to be changed.
Due to wartime
conditions
we were not able, at the time of writing
first paper, to take into account
all the earlier investigations
which, although
of quite a different
character,
were, nevertheless,

We shall therefore
begin our present
short historical

to indicate
the different

have been used by various
investigators,

the terminology.
We shall also discuss
the more important
of the application
of these kernels without

have been and continue
to be two trends
in the consideration
these kernels. To explain them we should mention
that such a kernel K(x, y)
may be characterized
as a function
of two points,
by a property
discovered
by J. Mercer
[l](2) in 1909. To the kernel K there corresponds
a well determined class F of functions/(x),
in respect to which K possesses the "reproducing"
(E. H. Moore
 ). On the other hand, to a class of functions F, there may correspond
a kernel K with "reproducing"
Those following
the first trend consider
a given kernel K and study
itself, or eventually
apply it in various domains
(as integral
equations,
of groups, general metric geometry,
and so on). The class F corresponding
K may be used as a tool of research,
but is introduced
a posteriori
(as in the
work of E. H. Moore
 , and more recently
of A. Weil [l], I. Gelfand
D. Raikoff
[l], and R. Godement
[l, 2]). In the second trend,
one is interested primarily
in a class of functions
F, and the corresponding
used essentially
as a tool in the study of the functions
of this class. One of
the basic problems in this kind of investigation
is the explicit construction
computation
of the kernel for a given class F.

THEORY OF REPRODUCING KERNELS
The first of these trends originated
in the theory of integral
by Hubert.
The kernels considered
then were continuous
of positive definite integral operators.
This theory was developed
by J. Mercer
under the name of "positive
definite kernels" and on occasion has been
used by many others
interested
in integral
equations,
especially
during the
second decade of this century.
Mercer discovered
the property
K(yi, yi)\&j è 0,
yi any points, £,• any complex numbers(3),
characterizing
his kernels, among all the continuous
kernels of integral
equations. To this same trend
belong the investigations
of E. H. Moore
who, during the second and third decades
of the century,
introduced
in the general analysis
under the name of "positive
matrices" with
a view to applications
in a kind of generalization
of integral
equations.
Moore considered
kernels K(x, y) defined on an abstract

For such classes, two problems present
themselves.

of completing

(before effecting the completion
of the class) if the complete
class will possess

A few remarks
should be added here about the problem of the completion
of a class of functions
forming an incomplete
space. Consider
class F. It is well known that to this class we can adjoin ideal elements

as the limits of Cauchy
in F, when such a limit
is not available
in F, and in such a way we obtain
an abstract
containing
the class F as a dense subset. This space, however,
will not form
a class of functions.
In quite an arbitrary
way we could realize the ideal elements to be adjoined to Fas functions so as to obtain a complete space formed
by a linear class of functions,
but, in general,
this arbitrary
of completion will destroy all the continuity
properties
between the values of the functions and the convergence
in the space.
In this paper when we speak about
the functional
completion
of an incomplete
class of functions
F, we mean a completion
by adjunction
of functions such that the value of a function / of the completed
class at a given
point y depends continuously
on / (as belonging to the Hilbert space) (5). From
the existence
of reproducing
kernels we deduce the fact that a completed class has a reproducing
In this way the problem
of functional
completion
and of the existence
of a reproducing
kernel in the complete
is merged into one problem.
We shall prove here the following theorem:
Consider a class of functions

completion of the class it is necessary
and sufficient that 1° for every fixed y(£E the linear functional
f(y) defined in F

all the required properties.
It remains

THEORY OF REPRODUCING KERNELS
To prove the first assertion,
that is, the completeness
of F, we shall consider any Cauchy

that / is a limit everywhere
of the Cauchy
{/„} which means that
it belongs to the above class F. As the norm of/ has to be the limit of ||/„||
it necessarily
with ||/||i.
It is also clear that
every function/

class. In summing
up the above arguments
see that any functional
completion
of F must coincide with F and have the
same norm and scalar
It should be stressed
that the second condition

our theorem.
We shall demonstrate
this by the following example:
the unit circle |z| <1. Take there an infinite sequence
[zn] such that
£(i-|z„l)<
We shall denote
by E the set of all points
zn, and in E we shall consider
the class F of all polynomials
in z. It is obvious that the values of a polynomial
everywhere
in the set E if the polynomial
is not identically
zero. Consequently
the values of a polynomial
on the set E determine
completely the polynomial.
We define the norm for a function/of
the class F by
the formula
= (f I #W I'dxdy,
z = x + iy,
where p denotes
the polynomial
whose values on the set E are given by the
/. We see that
F satisfies
all requirements
for a Hilbert
space with
the exception
of completeness.
The first condition
of our theorem
is satisfied
but the second is not. To prove
the last assertion
we take the Blaschke
<p(z) corresponding
to {zn}. This function
has the following
properties
4>0n) = 0,
» = 1, 2, 3, - • • ,
| 4>(z) | < 1
for | z | < 1.
N. ARONSZAJN
The function
<p(z) is a strong limit of polynomials
pk(z) in the sense
| <p(z) - pk(z) \2dxdy = 0.
Consequently
the sequence
{pk} is a Cauchy sequence in our class F and
the polynomials
pk(z) converge
at each point z„ to 4>(zn) =0, in spite of the
fact that the norms \\pk\\ converge
to \\<p\\ >0.
This example
also shows
us the significance
of condition
2°. We can
say that if condition
2° is not satisfied
it means that the incomplete

{z„' } of the unit
circle with a limit point inside the circle to the set E of our example,

considered
on this enlarged
set Ei with the same norm
as above, would satisfy condition
2°. There are infinitely
many ways of enlarging the set E where an incomplete
class F is defined so as to insure the
fulfillment of condition 2°.
In the general
case we can always
as follows. We can consider
the abstract
completion
of the class F by adjunction
of ideal elements.
completion
leads to an abstract
Hilbert space §. To every element of § there
corresponds
a well determined
function f(x) defined on the set (the limit of
Cauchy sequences
in F converging
to this element).
But to different

the same function/.
The correspondence
and the functional/(y)

of the fact
satisfied.)
To the set of elements
hy we can then add an additional
set of elements so as to obtain a complete
set in §. This additional
set will be denoted
by E'. We can then extend the functions
of our class F in the set E+E'
for any element
h(E.E', f(h) = (/, h). This class of functions,
so extended in E-r-E',
will then satisfy the second condition.
We shall complete
this section
by the following
happens that for the incomplete
class F a kernel K(x, y) is known such that for
every y, K(x, y) as function
of x belongs to F (or, even more generally,
belongs to a Hilbert
space containing
F as a subspace),
this kernel having
reproducing
f(y) = (S(x), K(x, y))
for every f G.F-
It is immediately
seen that the first condition
of our theorem
follows from
this reproducing
so that it suffices to verify the second condition
order to be able to apply our theorem.
5. The restriction
of a reproducing
Consider a linear class F of
THEORY OF REPRODUCING KERNELS
defined in the set E, forming a Hubert
space and possessing
K(x, y). K is a positive
If we restrict
the points
x, y to a subset
EiCZE, K will still be a positive
This means that K will correspond
to a class Fi of functions
defined in Ei with an adequate
||j. We shall
now determine
this class Fi and the corresponding
If K is the reproducing
kernel of the class F of functions
in the set E with the norm ||
||, then K restricted to a subset E1C.E is the reproducing
kernel of the class Fi of all restrictions
of functions
of F to the subset
Ei. For any such restriction, fiQ.Fi,
the norm ||/i||i is the minimum
of ||/|| for all

to Ei is fi.
Proof. Consider
the closed linear subspace
FoQF formed by all functions
which vanish at every point of Ei. Take then the complementary
F' = F&F0.
F0 and F' are closed linear
of F and possess
reproducing
K0 and K' such that
K = Ko + K'.
Since K0(x, y), for every fixed y, belongs to F0, it is vanishing
Consequently,
K(x, y) = K'(x, y),

of F to the set Ei. If two
functions/
and g from F have the same restriction/1
in Ei, f—g vanishes

if the difference
belongs to F0, f and g
have the same restriction
/1 in Ex. It is then clear that all the functions
which have the same restriction
/1 in E have a common
projection
and that the restriction
of A' in Ei is equal also to A- It is also clear that among
all these functions,/,//
is the one which has the smallest
norm. Consequently
by the definition
of the theorem,
we can write

K(x, y) = K'(x, y),

This shows that the restriction
Ki(x, y) of K'(x, y) coincides with the restriction
of K to the set Ei, which completes
our proof.
The norm ||

simple when the subclass

In this case F' = F, each function f G Fi is a restriction

Our assertion
will be that to the class F with the above-defined
norm there
corresponds
the reproducing
kernel K = K~i-\-K2. To prove this assertion
(1) K(x, y) as a function
of x, for y fixed, belongs to F Namely,
it corresponds
to the element

(2) Denote for fixed y, K'(x, y)=g'(K(x,

Consequently,

up, we may write the following
If Ki(x, y) is the reproducing

with fiQFi, and with the norm defined by
ll/ll2 = min [\\fl\\\ + ||/2||22],
the minimum
taken for all the decompositions

It is easy to see how this theorem
can be extended
to the case where
(6) This theorem was found by R. Godement
[l] in the case of a positive definite function
in a group.
N. ARONSZAJN
K(x, y) = 23"-1 ^¿(-T> y)- A particularly
simple case presents
itself when the
classes Fi and F2 have no function
besides zero in common.
The norm in F
is then given simply by ||/||HI/i|l? + K-
In this case (and only in this case) Fi and F2 are complementary
subspaces of F.
If we denote
by F the class of all conjugate
of functions
class F, then the kernel of F is clearly K~i(x, y) =K(x,
x) (K is the
kernel of F and in F the scalar product
(/, |)i is given by (g, f), the norm
||/||i by D/11). Consequently
Re K(x, y)=2~x(K(x,
x)) is the reproducing kernel of the class F0 of all sums/+g,
for/ and g in F with the norm
ll^iu = 2min [U/H2
the minimum
for all decompositions
/ and g in F.
If F is a complex
space corresponding
to a real space,
is, if F=F
and ll/ll =||/|| (see§l),it is clear that F0 = F and ||/||o = |l/ll- Consequently the
kernel K = Re K is real and this property
characterizes
the kernal
K corresponding
to a real space.
7. Difference of reproducing
For two positive matrices,
and K(x, y), we shall write
if K(x, y)—Ki(x,
y) is also a p. matrix.
From Ki<£.K2<£K3, it follows clearly that Ki<£K3. On the other hand, if
Ä'i«Ä"2 and K2<ZCKi, it follows that Kx = K2. In fact, we then have K2(x, x)
— K~i(x, x) 3:0 and alsoKx(x,
x)—K2(x, x) 3:0, which meansK2(x,
x) —Ki(x, x)
= 0. Further,
by the property
of positive
\K2(x, y) - Ki(x, y) |2 á [K2(x, x) - Ki(x, x)][K2(y,
y) - Ki(y, y)] = 0,
so that K2(x, y) =R~i(x, y) for every x, y in E. Thus we see that the symbol <iC

II. If K is the r.k. of the class F with the norm \\ \\, and if the
linear class FiCZF forms a Hubert
space with the norm K, such that A i
= ||A|| for every fiQFi,
then the class Fi possesses
a reproducing

Proof. The existence
of the kernel for F involves
the existence
of constants

Let us now introduce
an operator
L in the space
F, transforming
space F into the space Fi and satisfying
the equation
(A. /) = (A. Lf) i.
for every /, £ Fu
The existence
and unicity
of Lf is proved
in the following

functional

The operator
L is everywhere
in F, linear,
symmetric,
and bounded with a bound not greater than 1. It is clear that L is everywhere
and linear.
It is symmetric
for any two functions
/, /' of F,
(Lf, f') = (Lf, Lf')i = (Lf, Lf)i = (Lf, f) = (/, Lf). It is positive because

It is bounded

We define F2 as the class of all functions f2 = L'f for fQF.
F0 the closed linear subspace
of F transformed
by L' into 0, and by F' the
complementary
space F&F0. The functions
of F0 are also characterized
the fact that Z'2/=0 (from Z/2/=0 it follows that (L'2f,f) = (L'f, L'f) =\\L'f\\2

Now denote
by P' the projection
on F'. Every
two functions
transformed
by L' into the same function f2 of F2 differ by a function

ing to F0. Consequently,
they have the same projection
on F'. It is also clear
that the class F' is transformed
by L' on F2 in a one-to-one
way. We remark
further that
since for /oGF0,
(/o, L'f) = (L'fa, f) = (0, /) =0.
In the class F2 we introduce
the norm || ||2 by the equation
for any/with f2 = L'f.
the class F2 is isometric
to the subspace
being given by the transformation
L'). It follows that
F2 is a complete Hilbert
space and we shall show that the class F2 with the norm ||
admits as reproducing
kernel the difference K(x, y)—Ki(x,
y). To this effect
firstly that
the operator
L is given by the formula
(f, Ki(x, y)).
In fact, since LfE.Fi, f(y) = (f(x), Ki(x, y))i=(f(x),
Kx(x, y)). Consequently
for any fixed z, the operator
to K(x, z) gives the function
LK(x, z) =Ki(y,
z). If follows that the operator
I — L = L'2 transforms
into L'2K(x,
z) —Ki(y, z). This formula
proves, firstly, that K(x, z)
— K~i(x, z) as a function
of x belongs
to F2, since
it is the transform

= (f2(x), K(x, y) - Ki(x, y))2.
In these transformations
as any function
of F such that f2 = L'f
and we used the property
This finishes the proof of our
The proof of Theorem
II has established
even more than the theorem
announced:
it gives us the construction
of the class F2 and the metric
||2 for which the difference
K — K~i is the reproducing
Let us summarize
this in a separate
Under the hypotheses
of Theorem II, the class F2 and the
||2 corresponding
to the kernel K2 = K — Ki are defined as follows: the
equation fi(y) =Lf=
(f(x), K~i(x, y))x defines in F a positive operator with bound
not greater than 1, transforming
F into FiCF
We take any symmetric
root L'=(I—L)112.
F2 is the class of all transforms L'f for f(EF. Let F0 be the
closed linear subspace of all functions /G F with f=Lf
and let F' be F-&F0. L'
establishes
a one-to-one correspondence
between F' and F2. The norm \\f2\\2 for
f2 = L'f, f'EF',
is then given by
THEORY OF REPRODUCING KERNELS
The construction
of the class F2 is somehow
complicated
because we need
the square root L' of the operator
I—L. However,
there exists a much easier
way of constructing
an everywhere
dense linear subclass
of F2 and the norm
||2 in this subclass.
we can consider
the class F2 of all transforms (I-L)f=f-Lf=L'2f,
by the operator I-L.
This clearly is a linear subclass
of F2. The norm ||
||2 in Fi can be defined as follows:
II/ÍIÍ = l|£7|f = (L'f, L'f) = (/, £'7) = (/,/- Lf) - (/, /) - (/, Lf)
= (f,f)-(Lf,Lf)i.
In these transformations
we considered//
=/— Lf = L'*f.
F2 is everywhere dense in F2 (in respect
to the norm ||
||2), otherwise
would have a function f2 = L'f ^0 with (L'f, L'2g)2 = 0 for all gGF. We can
suppose here/'GF'
0 = (£'/',
L'2g)2=(f,
L'g) = (L'f,
L'/' = 0,/'GFo,
which is impossible.
The simplest
case is the one where Fi = F2. By using the spectral
decomposition,
we can easily show that this case presents
itself if, and only if, the
zero is not a limit point of the spectrum
of L', which is the equivalent
saying that
1 is not a limit point of the spectrum
of L. In this case F2=F'.
If L has a bound
<1, the spectrum
does not contain
1 and the subspace
with the whole space F so that
When L is completely
continuous,
the only limit point of the spectrum
L is zero, so that
1 is certainly
not a limit point, and Fi =F2 = F'.
immediately
Theorem III.
IV. Let K be the r.k. of class F. To every decomposition
+K2 in two p. matrices K~i and K2, there corresponds
a decomposition
identity operator I in F in two positive operators L\ and L2, I = L\-\-L2, given by
Lif(y) - (/(*), Ki(x, y)), L2f(y) = (f(x), K2(x, y)),
such that if Li
denote any symmetric
square roots of Li and L2, the
classes Fi and F2 of all transforms
L\/2fand Ll/2f respectively, /GF,
correspond to
the kernels Kx and K2. If F¿0, i = 1, 2, is the class of all /G F with Lif= 0, and if
Fi' =FOF,o,
then L\12 establishes a one-to-one correspondence
between FI' and
Fi and the norm || ||¿ in Fi is given by j|L¡ 2/||¿ = 11/|| for every fEF¡'.
Conversely, to each decomposition
I = Li-\-L2 in two positive operators there
correspond classes Fi with norms [|
|| ; defined as above. The corresponding
K~i are defined by Ki(x, y)=LiK(x,
y) and satisfy the equation K = Ki-\-K2.

We shall prove this theorem,
constructing
at the same time the class
the norm ||

to the matrix
K = Ki-K2C).
To this effect,
we consider the class £,• and the norm ||
||t- corresponding
to Ki and form the
F' of the Hubert
spaces Fi and F2, F' = Fi®F2(s).
We construct
this direct product
in the following manner:
We form the product
of all couples of points
{xi, x¡¡¡, x.G-E. In the set E' consider
class of all functions f'(x\, x2) representable
in the form:
f(xi, x2) = Z/i (*i)A (*0i
with /i G Fi and ffi QF2. As scalar product
of two such functions
we define:
(/', g')' = ¿¿(/i
, gi )i(A i gi )»•
where m is the number
of terms in the representation
of g'. The same function/'
of many different
representations
of type (1). The scalar
(/', g')',
is independent
of the particular
representation
chosen for
/' and g'. In fact, we see immediately
from (2) that
(/', g'Y = Z ((f'(xi, x2), gi\xi))h
which proves that (/', g') is independent
of the particular
representation
In a similar way we prove that it is independent
of the particular
representation of g'. We still have to prove that
(/', g')' satisfies all the requirements
for the scalar product.
It is clearly seen that it is a bilinear hermitian
/', g' and it remains
to be proved that

of sets, E their sum

Let F„, n = 1, 2, • • -, be a class of functions

In the general
case we have to introduce

by Theorem

We shall now prove the following theorem.
I. Under the above assumptions
on the classes Fn, the kernels
Kn converge to a kernel K0(x, y) defined for all x, y in E. Ko is the r.k. of the
class F0 of all functions

it may be infinite.
Proof. The convergence
of Kn to K is to be understood
in this way : any
two points x, y in £ belong to all £„ starting
from some £„0 on. Consequently
Kn(x, y) are defined for n>no

Consequently
it is a convergent
(5) shows then that
the functions
Kmk(x, y)QFk,
k and m—>*>, converge
in Fk to some function
<pk(x)QFk. This involves
limm=0O Kmk(x, y)=limm=00
Km(x, y)=<pk(x)
Since for every x, y in £ we can choose a k so that x and y belong to Ek, it
is clear that
Km(x, y) converge
the limit K0(x, y) does not depend
upon the choice of k. The function qt>k(x) is clearly the restriction
K0k(x, y) of
Ko to Ek. Consequently
Kmk(x, y), for fixed y, converges
Kok(x, y) which belongs to Fk. We then obtain
from (5), by taking n—>»,

N. ARONSZAJN
Since the quadratic

to a form of the same kind. This
proves that ||/o||o is a quadratic

It is clear
that \pk is the restriction

This allows us to prove that i/'o G F0, since it gives a bound for H^o*'!* independent of k, namely

This achieves
the proof of our theorem.
B. The case of an increasing

sequence of sets, E their intersection
Let F„ be a class of functions
in En. As before, we define the restriction
fnm, for/„GFn,
but now m has to be greater
n. We suppose
then that F„ form an increasing
THEORY OF REPRODUCING KERNELS
for every fn G Fn and every m ^ n, fnm G Fm.
We suppose
that the norms || ||„ form a decreasing
for every fn Q Fn and every m }Z n, ||/„m||m
á ||/„||n.
we suppose
that every
F„ possesses
a r.k. Kn(x, y).
Now, even for all £„ equal, we cannot deduce the existence of all kernels
Kn from the existence
of one of them.
As in the case A, we get for the restrictions
Knm of Kn the formula
{Km(y, y)} is an increasing
of positive
limit may be infinite. We define, consequently,
£0 = set of y G E, such that K0(y, y) = lim Km(y, y) < ».
For an illustration
of this point
decreasing
of domains
£„. If the intersection
£ of the domains
is composed of a closed circle with an exterior
to it, the set
£0 will be composed
of all interior
points of the circle.
We suppose that £0 is not empty and define the limit-class
of the classes
Fn in the following
way: let F0 be the class of all restrictions/n0
of functions
(n = i, 2, • • • ) to the set E0. From
(10), we know that the sequence
{[|/ni||k} *-«,n+i, • • • is decreasing
and we can define
||/-o||o = lim||A*||».
As in case A we prove that ||/no||o is a positive
form. This form
is positive
since from ||/„o||o = 0 it follows that for any yG£o,
= \U(y)\ = I (fnk(x), Kk(x, y))k\ ^\\fnk\\k(Kk(y, y))»MI/»o||o(#o(y, y))l/2 = 0,
that is,/„o = 0. Consequently
|| ||0 is a norm in F0.
In general F0 will not be complete.
In order that F0 admit of a functional
completion
with a reproducing
kernel, there are two conditions
to be fulfilled
which are given in the theorem
of §4. The first one is that for every y there
exists a constant
My so that
| Ao(y) | ^ Jf „||/»o||o

Let us remark
the functions

as defined

of /„ to £). Then, for every yQE,

to K0(y, y) =lim

Consequently,

Io of §4, is assured

to the set Eo- But the condition
2° of §4 is in general not assured.
We may illustrate
this by the counter-example
of §4. Take
all the En
equal to the set E of this counter-example.
As class F„ we take the «-dimensional subspace
of the class F introduced
there, consisting
of all polynomials
Each F„ is a complete
space and its r.k. Kn converges

to E. Consequently
E0 = E, F0 = F
and || || o is clearly
the norm introduced
To overcome
this difficulty
we can proceed as indicated
in §4. We complete F0 by ideal elements;
in the completed
space F0 we choose an
additional
set E' of ideal elements
such that the functions
of F0, extended
with the same norm as in Fo, form a space admitting
a functional
completion
leading to a class Fo with a reproducing
kernel Ko.
the theorem
of §5, we can return
now to our set Fo by restricting the functions
of F0 to Fo- If we take in the restricted
class the norm defined in the theorem
of §5, we shall get as r.k. the restriction
of Ko to Fo.
The restricted
class F0* and its norm ||
||* can then be described,
in terms of
the space F0 and its norm || ||0, in the following way.
/*GFo* if there is a Cauchy
{/o°} CF0 such that
fo(x) = lim/o (x)

Such sequences

/0* and go*.
It is important
to note that
(17) is still valid when only one of
the sequences
{/o0}, {go"*} is determining,
the other satisfying
only (15).
All these facts about
the space F0* and its norm and scalar product
easily obtained
when we form, as in §5, the subspace
of all/oGF0
in F0. The complementary
F0' =Fo-0-Fo
is then in an
isomorphic

with F0*, Jó —>/o*, where /0* is the restriction

Taking k—> » , we have

for X'/'X. This condition
(or the right side continuity)
is usually accepted,
reasons of convenience,
as an additional
on resolutions
of identity.
For any system
{/„(X)} satisfying
(a), (b), and (c), it is seen that ||/n(X)||2
is a non-decreasing
/¿n(X), A/ín = ¿t„(X") — ¿i„(X') = ||A/„||2.
We consider the measure
¿u„, introduced
on the real axis by Mn(X), which leads to the
Lebesgue-Stieltjes
/$(X)¿ju„(X).
It has been proved
there exists the limit
(«,A/») d(u,fn(\))

for all X with exception
of a set of /¿„-measure 0.
We have further
N|2 = 23 f°°|ç4„(x)l2^n.
(u, v) = 23 I <bn(\)^n(^)dpn, where \pn(\) =
d(o, /.(X))
Let us now apply the above considerations
to the construction
We suppose that our Hubert
space § is a class of functions defined in E with
a r.k. K(x, y).
For a given resolution
of identity
{P\ ] every subspace A§ will have a r.k.
which we shall denote by AK(x, y). The kernel AK determines
the projection
AP by the equation
AP/ = fi(y) = (f(x), AK(x, y)),
for any f G ©.
The kernel K corresponds
to the identity
/ and following (2) we have
K(x, y) = 23 à„K(x, y),
for any decomposition
{A*} of the real axis. The series in (8) converges
absolutely. In fact, following (2), the series K(y, z)=IK(y,
z) = ~^AkPK(y, z)

z) as function
of y is strongly
convergent.
It converges
then in the ordinary
sense for every y, in particular
for y = z. Thus, K(z, z) = ~YjAkK(z, z) < oo, AkK(z, z) 3:0. Consequently

The functions

The kernels 8ekK(x, y) are given by gk(x)gk(y), and (9) takes the form of the
well known
development
of the kernel

K(x,y) = J^gk(x)ikJy),
which for a long time was taken as a basis of the definition
Suppose now that the resolution
of identity
{P\} is given by a system of
A(X)=/n(x,
X) satisfying
(a), (b), and (c'). Following
(4) we define
for u = K(x, y) (considered

K(y, z) = (K(x, z), K(x, y)) = Z f *»(y, \)Mz~X)dpn,
K(y, y) = Z f I *.(y, X) 1*4*..
The series and the integrals

everywhere in X in the sense of the measure

in most applications
it turns out to be a continuous

11. Operators in spaces with reproducing
kernels(9). In a class F forming
a Hubert space with a r.k. K, the bounded operators
admit of an interesting
representation.
The notation
LxK(x, y) indicates
that the operator
is applied to K(x, y) as
of x and that the resulting
is considered
as function
(but it will depend also on y which will act in the transformation
as a parameter). It is then clear what is meant by LzK(x, z), LxL'zK(x,
z), and so on. The
Lf(x) is clear and we may also write Lf(x0) if xo is a particular
of x. Consider the adjoint operator!,*
(that is, the operator
for which (Lf, g)
= (/, L*g)). Take the transform
(9) The developments
of this section are closely related
with the work and ideas of E.
N. ARONSZAJN
A(x, y) = L*xK(x, y).
A is a function
of the two points x, y. As function
of x it belongs
Take then for any/GF
the scalar product
(f(x), A(x, y))x= (f(x), L*K(x,
= (Lf(x),K(x,y))x = Lf(y),
Lf(y) = (f(x), A(x, y)).
In this way, to each bounded
there corresponds
a kernel A(x, y)
which for every y, as function
of x, belongs to F The operator
is represented
in terms of the kernel by formula
Let us now find the kernel A*(x, y) corresponding
to the adjoint
L*. We have (L*)* = L and thus
(LxK(x, z), K(x, y)) = (K(x, z), L*xK(x, y)),
(A*(x, z), K(x, y)) = (A(x, y), K(x, z)),
A*(y, z) = A(z, y).
It is clear that
to Li-\-L2 or aL correspond
Ai+A2 and aA respectively.
We shall now find the kernel A corresponding
to the composition
Since (Li L2)* = L*L*, we have
A(y, z) = (LiL2)yK(y, z) = L2yLiyK(y, z)
= F2„Ai(y, z) = (A^x, s), A2(x, y)) = (Ai(x, z), A2(y, x))
(4) A(y, z) = (Ai(x, z), A2(y, x))
for L = LiL-
Let us note the following properties
immediately
from (l)-(4)
A(x, y))x, g(y))y
(g(y), A(x, y))y)x
- (f(x),(A(x,y),g(y))y)x.
(6) The symmetry of L is equivalent to the hermitian
A(x, y) = A(y, x).
We prove now the following property
The operator L is positive if and only if A is a p. matrix.
In fact, L positive means that for every

23 23 Çih(L*K(x,

yi), K(x, y,)) = 23 23 A*(y,-,
= 23 23 A(y,-,
y^if i > 0.
THEORY OF REPRODUCING KERNELS
This proves that A and thus A is also a p. matrix.
It also proves the well
known fact that a positive
is always symmetric.
If now A is a p. matrix,
we see that
(Lf, f) =5 0 will be satisfied
of the form
Z"f*-^(-T> yk). As these functions
form a dense set in F, every
may be approximated
by them and we get (Lf, /)^0
to the limit.
In generalizing
the notation
of §7 we shall write Ai<<CA2 or A2<3CAi for any
two kernels if A2 — Ai is a p. matrix.

kernel A(x, y), hermitian

A(x, y) =A(y, x)), the necessary

Necessity.
If L is the corresponding
not less than m and not greater
than M, we have
m(f, f) ^ (Lf, f) g M(f, f)
for every / G F.
It follows that ((L-mI)f,f)^0
and ((MI-L)f,f)^0,
that is, the operators L — ml and MI — L are positive.
Therefore,
from (7) we obtain
A — mK and MK—A are p. matrices.
Sufficiency. The condition
of the theorem
is clearly equivalent

This means that the kernel Ki = (l/(M—m)(A

it is a reproducing
kernel of a class Fi with the norm ||
and following Theorem I, §7, FiCF and ||/i||j ^||/i||
Then, as in
Theorem III, §7, the operator
Lif(y) = (f(x), Ki(x, y))
is a positive
in F with a bound not greater
1, that is,
This operator
corresponds
to Ä"i(x, y) by its definition.
Consequently,
A= (M — m)Ki+mK
there corresponds

An arbitrary
kernel A is representable
in a unique way in the form
A = Ai + iK2, Ai and A2 hermitian symmetric.
Namely, we have
N. ARONSZAJN
Ai(x, y) = — (A(x, y) + A(y, x)),
As(z, y) = — (A(x, y) - A(y, x)).
The necessary
and sufficient
in order that A correspond
bounded operator
is, clearly, that Ai and A2 correspond
to such operators.
the last kernels we can apply Theorem
We now consider convergence
of operators.
The three simplest
limit for bounded
are the following:
the weak limit, w. limn=00 Ln — L,
if Lnu converges
weakly to Lu for every u EF;
the strong limit, str. lim Ln = L,
if Lnu converges
to Lu; the uniform
limit, un. lim Ln = L, if ||L„ —L||
—>0, where || || for operators
their bound.
It is clear that
weak convergence
follows from strong
convergence
that strong convergence
follows from the uniform one.
It is known
w. lim Ln = L involves
the boundedness
of all ||Fn|| and
the inequality ||Z,||^lim
inf. ||F„||-
II. If L = w. lim L„, then for the corresponding
kernels we have
A(x, y) =lim An(x, y) for every x, y in E. If L = un. lim Ln, then A„ converges
to A in every set of couples (x, y) for which K(x, x) and K(y, y) are
uniformly bounded.
The first part follows immediately,
by the definition
of weak convergence
A(x, y) = (A(z, y), K(z, x))z = (L*K(z, y), K(z, *)).
= (K(z, y), LzK(z, y))z = lim (K(z, y), LnzK(z, x))z = lim An(x, y).

12. The reproducing kernel of a sum of two closed subspaces. Let F be a
class with a r.k. K. We know that the r.k.'s of closed subspaces
of F correspond
to the projections
on these subspaces.
The problem of expressing
the r.k. of the sum Fi@F2 oí two closed subspaces in terms of the r.k.'s Ki and K2 of these subspaces
is therefore reduced
to the problem of expressing
the projection
P on Fi©F2 in terms of the projections Pi and P2 on Fi and F2.
In order to obtain
this we shall at first prove the identity
[(P-Pi)(P-P2)]-
= P - Z PÁPtPl)
+ P2(PlP2) ft"1 - (P2Pl) " - (P1F2) k ] - (P2Pl) m.
We shall use the known properties
of projections,
namely: Pi = P1P = PPi
= Pf, P2 = P2P = PP2 = Pl
N. ARONSZAJN
Pi(P - Pi) = (P - Pi)Pi
P2(P - P2) = (P ~ P2)P2 = 0.
the expression
(P — Pi)(P
— P2) by Q we have
QkPl m Qk-lÇp _ pi)(p
_ pi)Pl = Qb-irp _ pi)(Pi
= - <2'i-1P2Pi + Qk-lPiP2Pi.
the first term is -<2*-2(P-P])(P-P2)P2Pi
= 0, and we have
QkPí = Qk-ip1p2pu
(?Pi = - P2F1 + P1P2P1.
by induction
<2<Pi = - (P2Pi)* + Pi(P2Pi)k.
Q = (P - Pi)(P - P2) = P - Pi-
P2 + PXP2.
This gives
Qn = Qn-i'p - P1 - P2 + pyp¿ = Qn-lp _ Q^IP, - Q^Pj + Q^PiP^
Since <2"-ip = Ç»-1, (3«-ip2 = 0, we get from (2)
Qn = q»-i _ Q»-ipj + (2»-ip1P2
[-(PiPi)""1
+ P1(P2Pi)""1]
+ [-(P2Pi)"-iP2
+ P1(P2Pi)"-1P2]
= Q«-l + (P.PAn-l
- P^P.^y-l
_ p2(pip2)n-1
+ (PlP2)n.
This expression
is valid for w^2.
Adding these equations
side by side for
n = m, m — i, • ■ ■ , 2, and using the formula
for Q given in (3), we obtain
the required
for Qm. This formula
may be written
in the form
Pi)(P - P2)]» + (P2Pi)™
[FitP.p,)*-1
+ p2(PiP2y^
- (p2Pi)* - (P1P2)*].
We shall prove now that
(P2Pi)m converges
projection
P0 on the intersection
F0 of Fi and F2. In order to do so we shall
the operator
L = P2Pi in the space F2.
In this space L is a positive
(and therefore
symmetric)
bound not greater
than 1. In fact, for uQF2
(P0P1U, P2Piu) = ||P2Pi«||z ^ |1Fiîî||2 = (Pi«, Pi«) = (Pi«, «) = (Pi«, Piu)
= (PgPi«, u) = ||Pi«||2 s ||«||2,
THEORY OF REPRODUCING KERNELS
0 ^ (Lu, Lu) ^ (Lu, u) ^ (u, u).
Consider now for any/G
F the sequence [Lkf\. For£3:l,
Lkf = P2PiLk~f
EF2. Putting u = Lkf in (5), we get
0 è (Lk+y, Lk+f) ¿ (£*+»/, L»f) ^ (Lkf, Lkf),
0 ^ (L2k+if, Lf) á (L2kf, If) g (F2*-1/, Lf).
Consequently
the sequence
[Lnf, Lf)} is a decreasing
of positive
and therefore
it is convergent.
This gives
lim ||Fm/ - I»/H2 = bm [(Lmf, Lmf) - (Lmf, L"f)
- (L'f, L"f) + (L'f, L'f)]
= lim [(L^~f,Lf)
- 2(Z"+«-»/,Lf) + (F2-1/, F/) ] = 0
and thus Lmf converges
This means
that Lm converges
some bounded
P0. We have further
Lm+1f=LLmf
= LmLf, which,
m^> oo, gives
LPof = Pof = PoLf.
Therefore LmP0f=P0f
and Po/=lim
LmP0f=Pof.
In the subspace F2, F0

with Fq/=Po/
shows that in F2 the operator
P0 is a projection.
It is the projection
on the subspace of all Pof. From (6) we get \\P2PiPBf\\^\\PiPof\\£\\Pof\\=\\P2PiPof\\.
Consequently
\\P2PiP0f\\ =||F1P0/|| =||Po/||,
P2PiP0f = PiPof = Pof
Po/GFo = Fi• F2. Inversely
if uEFi-F2,
Lu = P2Pxu = u and
= lim L"u = u.
Thus, in F2, Po is the projection
on F0. Then for any/GF,
we have by (6)
Pof = PoLf =P0P2Pif=
projection of/on
In our formula
(4), besides the series 23 and tne term (P2Pi)m we have still
the expression (P — Pi)(P — P2)m. P — Pi is the projection on F'OFi,
is the projection
if we denote Fi©F2 by F'. Consequently
for m^><»,
the last expression
to the projection
on the intersection
of (F'OFi)
and (F'-OF2).
But this intersection
is reduced
to the element
zero because were there in it any element
w^O, it would belong to F' and
would be orthogonal
to Fi as well as to F2. Thus,
u would be orthogonal
Fi©F2 = F' which is impossible.
In this way we finally obtain
the desired
for the projection
(7) p = Po + 23 [Pi^Pi)*-1

- (p2Pi)k - (PiP2)kl
The subspace
is defined
as the closure
of the subspace

In general
Fi + F2 is not a closed
N. ARONSZAJN

advantageous
when Fi + F2 is closed and thus
equal to F' = Fi0F2.
Let us analyze this case more in detail.

in order that

Consequently,

with any e;>0. Such a constant
is necessarily
less than or equal to 1 and it
gives always an evaluation
of the minimal angle <p:
sin tj> ^ c > 0.
The angle <f> being positive,
the inequalities

the operators
(P2Pi)n in F2 or (PiP2)n in Fi are not greater
than cos2n<£.Formula
(7) may now be written
in the form
P = (Pi - P1P2 + P1P2P1 - P1P2P1P2 + • • • )

and the two series are uniformly
convergent
to the operators
Qi and Q2 which
give the decomposition of /GFi+F2 in f=Qif+Q2f, Çi/GF, QrfQF,.
It should be remarked
that the decomposition
of the series in (7) into the
two series (15) is not possible when 0 = 0, as the operators
Qi and Q2 are then
unbounded.
When the series in (15) are used for computation
it is very easy to get

for the remainder.
we shall want
to compute,
for / and g
in F, the value of (/, Pg) = (/, Qig)+(f,
Q2g). It is clear that when we stop in
the series of Qi at the wth term Pf* = (-\)n-lPiP2Pi
■ ■ ■ , then the remainder Rf' of this series will be given by
(16) Ri = — Pi Q2 for odd n, Ri = — Pi Qi for even n.
We have similar
developments
for the second series defining
Q2. Consequently, the error in (/, Qig) (for example when n is odd) is given by (/, Rig)

By (12) we have

Even in case c/> = 0 we could still evaluate
the error in (/, Pg) if Qig and
Q2g exist and if we can evaluate
their norms.
Still another
evaluation
of error (preferable
as an a priori evaluation),
the case ci>>0, is obtained
p - 23 [ ]=[(-?-
Pi)(p - p*)\m + (PtPi)m-
It can be proved that the minimal

where || || signifies bounds of operators.
In case of a sum of more than two subspaces
F' = FiffiF2ffiF3ffi
can still express the projection
on F' in terms of projections
on Fi, F2, • • • ,
but the formula will be much more complicated
than in the case of two subspaces and for this reason may not be as valuable.
Let us consider
now the translation
of our formulas
of the reproducing kernels Ki, K2, and K' of the classes Fi, F2, and F' = Fi©F2. We
shall suppose
that the classes Fi and F2 have no function
^0 in common,
that is, Fi-F2=(0).
To the projections
Pi, P2, P there correspond
(in the sense of §11) the
kernels K\, K2 and K'. To each term in the series (7) or (15) there corresponds
a kernel given by the following table of correspondence

in the form
K'(x, y) = Z (A„-i(x, y) + A„_i(x, y) — A„(x, y) — An(y, x))

If we use these series to compute

shall represent
it in the form
K'(x, y) = (K'(z, y), PzK'(z, x)) = (K(z, y), PzK(z, x))

We shall now have to apply an important
of S. Banach
the theory of linear transformations.
Let F be a linear transformation
of a linear subspace
F' of a complete
space F on a linear subspace
F{ of a complete
space Fi. The subspaces
and Fi'are
not necessarily
closed. The transformation
T is called closed if
from {/„}CF',/n->/GF,
and F/n->/,GFi follows/GF',/i G F/ and Tf=f.
If T is a closed linear transformation
of F' on F{,
F and Fi complete normed vector spaces and if F' is a closed
of F, then T is continuous
and consequently
bounded ithat is, there
exists a M>0
with \\Tf\\i^M\\f\\).
The image F{ is either = Fi or of first category in Fi.
Before we apply this theorem
we shall prove the following lemma:
Lemma. Let Fi and F2 be classes with r.k.'s and let F0 be their intersection
Fi-F2. The correspondence

IV3. Under the hypotheses of corollary IV2, in order that Fi = F
it is necessary and sufficient that there exist two positive constants m and M

The second part of Banach's
with our lemma leads to
the following remark
which belongs to the subject
of section
If {Fn\ is a strictly
increasing
sequence of (R.K.)-classes,
their sum F= Z-^« is n°t a (R.K.)-class.
In fact, were there a norm ||
in F giving it the structure
of a Hubert space with r.k., the subspaces
would be of first category
in F and therefore
F would be of first category
itself which is impossible.
(D) Connection with existence domains
in a Hilbert space. We shall now
use the notion introduced
by J. Dixmier
[l] of domains of existence
in a Hilbert
space. A linear subset of a Hilbert
space is called a domain
existence,
d.e., if there exists a closed linear transformation
defined in this
subspace and transforming
it into a subspace
of another
Hilbert space (which,
in particular,
may be identical
to the first Hilbert
space). The d.e.'s D in a
given Hilbert space § with norm |
|| may be characterized
by the following
there exists a norm ||
|i defined in D giving it the structure
space and satisfying
||â||i ^ ||ä||
for every h QD.
In fact, if D is a d.e., then we consider
the linear closed transformation
T of D into a subspace
of some Hilbert
space ¡q', with the norm ||
||'. It is
then clear that the norm || ||i defined by
- IHT+ IM"
gives D the character
of a complete
space which satisfies condition
N. ARONSZAJN
On the other hand, suppose
that a norm ||
||i is defined in D satisfying
(3) and giving D the character
of a complete
space. Then the correspondence
transforming
any element
of D, considered
as a subspace
into the same element
considered
in the Hilbert
space D (with norm ||
is obviously
a closed transformation
and D is therefore
Using Theorem
II from §7 and Theorem
IV of section
(C) we prove now
immediately
the following theorem.
V. If a class of functions
F forms a Hilbert space with a reproducing
kernel, then for any linear subclass FiCF,
the necessary and sufficient condition
in order that Fi be a (R.K.)-class
is that Fi be a d.e. in F.
If we have two classes of functions
Fi, F2, with reproducing
can combine these two classes in different
ways in order to form new classes.
Let us consider
in particular
the following
classes of functions:
and F=Fi + F2.
VI. // Fi and F2 are (R.K.)-classes,
then the same is true of the
classes Fi-F2 and Fi + F2.
Proof. The linearity
of the classes is obvious.
We take firstly the intersection
F0. With any norms ||
||i and ||
||2 corresponding
to Fi and F2 we
define the norm in F0 by the equation
This norm clearly defines a quadratic
in Fo satisfying
all the required properties.
For instance,
the completeness
of Fo results
immediately
from the lemma of section
As ll/ll i= |l/l11 for/GFo, Theorem II, §7 gives then the existence of a r.k.
In the case of the sum, F= Fi+F2,
we may apply the theorem
of §6 which
states that Ki and K2 being the r.k.'s with the norms ||
||i and ||
and F2, Ki+K2
is the reproducing
kernel of our class F.
the operations
we can also introduce
the direct
Fi®F2 as defined in §8 as another
leading to a (R.K.)-class
when Fi and F2 are (R.K.)-classes.
The class Fi®F2 however is defined not in
E but in the product
If we take its restriction
to the diagonal
of all pairs {x, x}, we get a class of functions
defined in E. It can be proved
that this class does not depend on the choice of norms in Fi and F2 as long as
the norms give to Fi and F2 the structure
of a Hilbert
space with a r.k.
Part II. Examples

In this part we shall give examples showing how
our general theory may be applied in particular
cases and to what kind of results it leads. With a few exceptions

tion and will not give in explicit form the formulas
and relations
obtainable
by our general
We shall treat
essentially
two kinds of kernels:
the Bergman's
F(z, Zi) and the harmonic
kernels H(z, Zi).
(1) Bergmari s kernels. These kernels correspond
to a domain
space of n complex
z=(z(-r>, z(2), • • ■ , z(n)). We consider
2í=2íz> of all analytic
in D with a finite norm given by
\f(z'-l\zm,

where z(A) =x(4) -\-iyw.
class 21 possesses
a reproducing
K = Kd—the
kernel corresponding
In our examples
we shall consider
essentially
the case of plane domains
D. li D is multiply-connected
we shall consider
also the reduced
kernel K'(z, Zi), which is the reproducing
kernel of the subspace
21' of 21 consisting of all functions
of 21 with a uniform
integral j'fdz.
If D is of finite connection
n, the complementary
2I-0-2I' is (» — l)-dimensional
by n functions
to„' (z) (between
which there is the linear relation
23w* =0) defined in the following way: if Bk, k=\,
2, • • • , », are the
components
of the boundary
B of D, to* is the derivative
is uniform)
of the multiform
to* whose real part
w* of D corresponding
to Bk, that is, the harmonic
function regular in D, equal to 1 on F*, and vanishing
on all the other components
The functions
w¿ belong always to 21 and are orthogonal
to 21'. We have
the relation
K(z, zi) = K'iz, zi) + 23 Cifwliz)w'iizi),
where 23 is the r.k. of 21021'. Consequently
the matrix {ca} is definite positive
(see §3) and it is the conjugate
inverse of the Gramm 's matrix
{ (to/ , to/ )}.
kernels possess an important
of invariance:
of domains
in the space of » variables
z(1), • • • , z(u>, if T represents
D pseudoconformally
on D', then
FV(z\ z{)dTiz)dTizi)
= KDiz, zi).
Here, z'=Tiz),
zi =F(zi),
and c)F(z) is the Jacobi
determinant
of T. In the
case of domains
in the plane,
if /(z) represents
D conformally
on D', this
formula takes the form
KD>iz',z{)-t'iz)VÔÎ) = KDiz,Zi).
N. ARONSZAJN
The importance
of the Bergman
kernels lies in the possibility
they offer of
generalizing
on analytic
of one complex variable
to functions
of several complex
(such as Schwarz's
distortion theorems,
representative
in pseudo-conformal
mappings).
In the case of one variable
almost all the important
are expressible
in terms of these kernels.
For instance
if D is a simply
connected domain, the mapping
function £" =/(z, z0) which represents
|f| <R in such away
that the point ZoG-0 goes into f = 0and/'(z0,
z0) = l is

(2) Harmonic
kernels. Consider
in a plane domain
D (we could consider
also a domain in «-dimensional
space) the class $8=93z> of all regular harmonic

a reproducing
will be denoted
It should be remarked
that another
kernel is often considered,
the one which corresponds
to the Dirichlet
= ff [|*'*|2
+ \h'y\2]dxdy.
This kernel is easily expressible
by Bergman's
kernel and consequently
does not present
any additional
difficulties
to the ones encountered
study and computation
of Bergman's
The situation
is different
for the kernel H. Even for very simple domains
(for instance
for a rectangle)
there is no known explicit expression
in the form of an infinite development.
(We disregard
here the developments
in terms of a complete
non-orthogonal
which are always
for a r.k., but whose coefficients
are quotients
of determinants
One reason
for the greater
difficulty
of the investigation
of the kernels
H(z, Zi) as compared
to Bergman's
kernels lies in the fact that H has no such
invariancy
vis-à-vis conformai
transformations
as have Bergman's
The interest
of the kernel H lies in its connection
with the biharmonic
problem which governs
the question
of equilibrium
of elastic plates.
kernel H gives a simple expression
for a function
u(z) such that

2. Comparison
two domains
in the plane,
D', DC.D'. The kernels KD> or Hd>, restricted
to the domain D, are reproducing kernels of classes 21° or Sß° formed
by the restrictions
of functions
21d' or 33s'. As any analytic
or harmonic
in D vanishes
everywhere,
any function f0 of 21° or SB0 is a restriction
of only one function/
from 21b- or 33d' and, following §5, Part I, the norm I/o |° = ||/||'- It is then
clear that every /0G2I° belongs to 2ID and that ||/o||0è|[/o||.
We can apply Theorem II of §7, I, which gives
Kd- <3C Kb, Kd' being the restriction of Kb- to D.
In the same way we get
If the kernel KD is known, we get immediately
the well known estimates
for the kernel KDi :
FV(z, z) g KDiz, z), \KD>iz, zi) | á (Fj>(z, z)KD(zlt Zi)Y'2
for points z and zi belonging
But the relation
(1) (or (2)) allows much better estimates.
the kernel Kr>> is known. For two points z and Zi in D take domains

ZiEDi CD and that the kernels KD" and KDi> be

N. ARONSZAJN
If we consider
a boundary-point
/ where the boundary
has a finite curvature and if we fix Zi and move z towards
t, the estimate
(3) will grow like
1/| z —1\. The estimate
(4) by a convenient
choice of the comparison
D', D",andD{'
will give a bound for | KD(z, Zi)\ growing only like 1/| z — t\ 1/2.
To show the interest
of this improvement,
take D simply-connected
the conformai
of D on a circle
f = K(, *\ I K{Z' Z0)dZ-
K{Zo, Zo) J 2„
Our problem
will be to compute
the point r on the circumference
corresponding
to t on the boundary
B. As the kernel
K is not known
approximate
it by a development
in orthogonal
functions.
This development
may converge
inside the domain
but in general
it will not
on the boundary
and will converge
less and less well the nearer we
come to the boundary.
To calculate
r we have to integrate
from z0 to the point t on the boundary.
term by term the development
of K as it does not converge on the boundary.
we do then is to find, with the help of the
(4), a point Zi near t for which the integral
z0)\dz is sufficiently
small. We can integrate
the development
of K term by term from
Zo to Zi and obtain
as good an approximation
of t as we wish.
It is clear that with the estimate
(3) we would not be able to do this.
3. The difference
of kernels.
As we saw in §2, in DCZDX, the kernels
K = Kd and K!=Kd¡
satisfy the relation Ki<£K (the kernel Ki being restricted
to D). To illustrate
the developments
of §7, I, let us investigate
the class of functions
F2 corresponding
to the p. matrix
K2 given by
K2(z, Zi) = K(z, Zi) — Ki(z, zi)
z and Zi in D.
the notation
in the proof of Theorem
II, §7, I (where
Fi = 3Ii), we introduce
the operator
L in SI by
Lf = A(zi) = (/, Ki(z, zi)) = ff
f(z)Ki(z, zi)dxdy.
If we consider
the Hilbert
space $i of all functions
u(z) in square
integrable in Di with the norm
| «||i = I I | u(z) | dxdy,
the general
of r.k.'s as projections
shows that/i(z),
as function
D\, is the projection
on 3Ii of the function/(z)
in D and =0 in Di — D.
Consequently,
^llA(«)l|i^ll/W||i
THEORY OF REPRODUCING KERNELS
The second inequality
may become equality
for/(z)?^0
only in the case
when Di — D is of two-dimensional
0 (for instance
when D differs
from Z>i only by some slits). We will exclude
this case and consequently
= UfW < ll/ll
We introduce
then the operator
L'2 = I - L.
The subspace
F0 is here reduced
to 0 as 0yif=Lf
is impossible
in view of
(3). Therefore
F' = F=-2l and the only possibilities
for the class F2 are: Io,
F2 = 2I or 2°, F2 is a dense subspace of 21.
The first case represents
itself always when D is completely
Di (DC.Di).
In fact, the operator
L is then completely
continuous.
this we take a sequence
{g(n)} C2Í converging
to gG2I. The functions
|(n) converge
then weakly in §i to g and their projections
gin) on 21i converge
to gi. But the weak convergence
in SIi involves
convergence
of gi (z) towards gi(z) in any closed subset of Di, in particular
in D (see section
(5), §2, I). When we restrict
the functions
giB,(z) and gi(s) to D they become
the transforms
Lg(n) and Lg. Therefore,
the uniform
convergence
of gin) to gi
in D involves
the strong
convergence
of Lg(n) to Lg in the space 21.
our remarks
after Theorem
III, §7, I, the class F2 = F'= 21. To
get the norm ||/||2 corresponding
to the kernel K2, we have to find the solution
g(z) of the equation
which exists and is unique for every /G2I. Then
ii/B-yr-iyî
gi(zi) = Lg = Il
g(z)Ki(z, zi)dxdy.
Let us note that the operator
L which in general has a bound not greater
than 1 has here a bound less than 1.
To illustrate
the second case we have to take a domain
having common
points with the boundary
of D\. It seems probable
that for every
such domain D we shall be in the second case (at least if one of the boundary
components
of D arrives at the boundary
To prove that
we are in the second
case, we have
to show that
L has a bound
= 1. Then L cannot be completely
continuous
bound is not attained).
The class Ft is a proper subclass of 21. The class F2 of
all functions
N. ARONSZAJN
h(¿) = g(z) - gi(z).
where gi = Lg, g E SI,
is a proper subspace
of F2, dense in F2. For such a function /2, the norm in
F2 is given by
Il/II2 II II2 II II2
= Ikll - l|gi||i-
The class F2 in the metric of 21 is a dense subspace
of 21. There are functions /G2Í which do not belong to F2 and for which, a fortiori,
the equation
f=g — Lg has no solution
gG2I. (There may be such a solution,
but not in square integrable
For two explicitly
given domains DEDi,
it may not be easy to prove that
we are in the second case by using the property
that the bound of F is 1.
We can transform
this property
into another
one, more easily proved.
To this effect we shall consider for any function /iG21i the quotient
Q(fi) = H/iUVll/iHi.
Lemma. In order that the bound of L be 1 it is necessary and sufficient that
there exist functions f with Q(fi) as near 1 as we wish.
To prove this lemma we remark
firstly that
the l.u.b. Q(fi) for/iG21i
the same as the l.u.b. Q(Lf) for/G21.
In fact the Lf form a dense subspace
the space 21i (otherwise
there would be a giG21i, gi^O, with (gi, F/)i = 0 for
every/G2I.
= (gi, F/)i = 0 and gi = 0 in D which involves
gi = 0 in DÏ). Consequently,
is for every /iG21i a function
II/1-F/II1 as small as we wish. As ||/i-F/||
^||/i-F/||i
it is clear that Q(Lf)
will approach
Qifi) as nearly as we wish.
Now, QiLf) can be represented
(Lf, Lf) (F/, Lf)
Q{Lf) = (Lf,Lf)i (Lf,f)
Our lemma amounts
to the equivalence
of the two properties,
for any a,
(Lf, Lf) è a2(f, f)
for all f G 21,
(Lf, Lf) ^ a(Lf, f)
for all f E 21.
From (6") follows (6'):
(Lf, Lf) ^ a(Lf, f) =S a(Lf, LfY'2(f, fY'2
(Lf, LfY'2 ^ a(f, fY'2, (Lf, Lf) ^ a2(f, /).
From (6') follows
(Lf,f)^a(f,f)
for all f GZ.
THEORY OF REPRODUCING KERNELS
In fact, we have
(Lff) ^ (LfLfyufy2
rg a(ffy>2(f,fy2 = «(/,/).
From (6'")
follows (6"): we use the fact that L is positive
which gives
(Lf, g)ú(Lf,fy'2(Lg,
g)1'2. Then
(Lf, Lf) = (Lf,fyi2(LLf, Lf)"2 Ú (LffyiV2(Lf
(Lf, Lf)™ ¿ aV\Lf, fy\ (Lf Lf) £ a(Lf /).
This proves our lemma.
We shall apply
to two domains
point which belongs also to the boundary
of the exterior of D. We
suppose further
that at this boundary
point the boundaries
of D and Dj have
a common tangent.
We can take the common boundary
point as the origin O
and the inner normal of the boundaries
at this point as the positive
It is then easily verified
that the functions
n — 1, 2, • • • ,
for sufficiently
of n, belong
to 2L and that
they satisfy
asymptotic
||/n|| ~||/»||i
This shows that the l.u.b. Q(f) = 1 and that we are in the second case.
Let us consider
now another
kind of example
which we excluded
we shall suppose that the domain D differs from Dx only by a number of slits of finite length.
It is then immediately
seen that for a function
considered
as belonging
to 21ÏC2I (21? = class 21i restricted
Consequently
21? is a closed linear subspace
of 21 and the kernel K(z, Zi)
— Ki(z, zi) corresponds
to the subspace

by Szegö. We shall now give an
application
of Theorem
II, §8, I. Consider a domain in the plane with a sufficiently

sake we may suppose
curves are analytic).
For this domain
we shall consider

corresponds
to the class 5 of all analytic

are not necessarily
continuous
on the boundary
we have to specify the meaning
of the boundary

We shall suppose
for such a function
f(z), its integral
F(z) is a continuous
in the closed domain
(but F(z) may be a multi-

form function).
Then we suppose
that for any two points

F(t2) — F(h) may be represented
by the integral

expression for the kernel were communicated
by A. Erdélyi.
It should be noted that the system was already introduced
by S. Zaremba
who also noticed that it is orthogonal
and complete in the Dirichlet metric.

form a complete

functions,
the real and imaginary
parts of pn(z) also
form a complete system. On the other hand, it is easy to verify that these real
and imaginary
parts form an orthogonal
system. This verification
is made in
an easy way by performing
the integration
in the rectangle

f f fix, y)dxdy

one verifies easily that the sequence <£n(z) defined by

fixed, while a—>». The ellipse in the limit will become
the horizontal
It is clear that
our theorem
on the limit of
kernels applies in this case and we get the kernel H(z, Zi) for the strip as a
limit of the kernels corresponding
to ellipses. Before performing
this passage
THEORY OF REPRODUCING KERNELS
to the limit, we shall at first make a few preliminary
As in the preceding paragraph,
we consider the quantities
h and e given by
o = A sinh e,a — h cosh e, b being fixed and a—»». We see immediately
h—* » and e—»0 in such a way that Ae—>ô.
In the conformai
z = h cosh f we introduce
a new variable
by the equation
Then z = A sin **£', and the ellipse with the slit along the real axis going
from +h to —a is transformed
in the rectangle

values of h the ellipse will contain
z. Suppose
then the corresponding
f will lie in the upper
half of the rectangle
Rt and for A—>»,
f—>z/6i. The point f " =f' — iri/e will then correspond
to the conjugate
z, so that (f " +Tri/e)-J>zi/b.
If we now return
to the formula
for the kernel
§5 and replace
the function
pn(z) by the expression
sinh wf/sinh
then replace f by tÇ'+iri/2
and separate
the series which expresses the kernel
H (see (5), §5) into parts
corresponding
to even and odd indices,
write the kernel in the form of a sum of four series:

For A—*», if we denote n/h by ¿ and if we then notice the asymptotic

seen that the series represent approximating

The convergence
of these sums towards
the integrals

verified and in this way we obtain
for the kernel of the horizontal
expression
given by the above four integrals

the values z/bi and Zi/bi:

This integral
representation
of the kernel corresponds
to a resolution
in the Hubert
space S3 corresponding
to the strip. This resolution
has a quadruple
(see §10, I) defined by the following
functions/*(z, X):/*(z, X) =0 for XgO, for X>0

satisfy the conditions

from §10, I. The condition

from the fact that

7. Limits of increasing
of kernels.
In the preceding
we had an example of a limit of decreasing
of classes and kernels.
We shall give here an example
of an increasing

of §9, I, we have to consider
the set F0
where F0(z, z) = lim F„(z, z) < oo.
Every point of the open circle Ci belongs to F0. In fact, if Ka) is the Bergman's
kernel for Ci, by the method
of comparison

K(z, z) =lim
Kn(z, z) ^Ka)(z,
z) for z in G*
The same is true for zGG-
We are going to prove that
Fo = Ci + C2.
We have to show that for z0Q.E — E0, lim Kn(zo, z0) = ». We use again a
of comparison.
We take a closed line L defining an exterior
5 containing
E and such that by a convenient
translation
we can approach
L as near as we wish to z0 without
E. The domain
5 will contain
Dn from some n onwards.

Zo). The translation
of the line L (and the domain
S) will have on
Ks(zo, zo) the effect as if the domain
5 were fixed and the point zo were moving
the boundary
L. As for Bergman's
kernels of domains
of finite connection we have the theorem
that K(z, z) goes uniformly
to + » when z approaches the boundary
(12), we arrive at the result, lim Kn(z0, z0) = + ».
For ZoGFv — Fo, with exception
of z0= +1, we can take as L a sufficiently
small circumference.
For z0= +1, a circumference
do. We take then
for L the boundary
of a square,
for instance,
for z0 = + 1, we take the square:
-€<x<l-e,e<y<l+e.
Using the notation
of §9, I, (B), we see immediately
the class F0
with the norm ||

of the class F of all functions/(z)

and regular in each (but/(z)

Consequently,
the condition

and we obtain
a functional completion
F* of F0. Then,
it is easily proved,
by using general
approximation
of analytic
functions,
that the space F* coincides
The r.k. of F is immediately
seen to be given by:
K(z, zi) = 0 if z and Zi belong to different circles,
K(z, zi) = K(i)(z, Zi) if z and zi belong to G.

8. Construction of reproducing kernels by the projection-formula
(I2) This theorem
is proved by using conformai
and the invariancy
kernels. For the kernels H for which the invariancy
is not true, a similar
theorem has been proved only for domains with sufficiently smooth boundaries.
N. ARONSZAJN
I. The formula
of §12, giving the r.k. of a sum of two closed subspaces,
serve in many cases for the construction
of kernels.
We shall indicate
few cases when it can be applied.
(1) The expression for Hiz, zx) in terms of F(z, Zi). Consider
for a domain
D in the plane the classes 21 and Sß. In spite of the similarity
of the metrics in
the two classes, the relationship
their kernels K and H does not seem
a simple one. We shall get such a relation
by using the formula
(18), §12, I.
To this effect we remark
firstly that
the class 58 is a class of complex
valued functions,
that is, every function
A of the class is representable
form h = hi-\-ih2, hi and A2 harmonic
and real-valued.
Consequently,
21 is a linear closed subspace of the class 93. Also the class 21 of all antianalytic
(that is, conjugate/(z)
of analytic
functions/)
with a similar norm
is a closed linear subspace
of §. On the other hand, it is clear that
function he$? is representable
hiz) = /¿(i) + Mz)
with two analytic
functions f and /2. These functions
are uniquely
determined
with the exception
of additive
constants.
In general,
in this decomposition,
the functions/i
may be of infinite norm, that is, they may not belong
to our classes 21 and 21. But when the boundary
of D is not too irregular
may be proved that a dense subclass of SB is decomposable
in this form with
/i and/2 belonging to 21 and 21 which means that 33 = 21 ©21. In order to avoid
the indétermination
of the above decomposition
of AGS3 into/i+/2
of the additive
we shall admit to the class 21 only functions / satisfying the condition
J f fdxdy = 0.
With 21 so fixed, the condition
21-21 = (0) is satisfied.
Consequently,
apply our formula
to calculate
the kernel H.
for H a development
of the form
Hiz, Zi) = 23 (A'n-iiz, si) + A^_i(z, 2i) — A„(z, Zi) — An(zi, z))
where the A's are expressible
in terms of the r.k.'s of 21 and 21 following
from §12. Since the kernel for 21 is F(z, Zi), the kernel for 21 is immediately
seen to be FJ(z, zi)+const.
The constant
is easy to determine
we get for the kernel
K of 21 the expression
F(z, Zi) = K{zi, z) — l/cr where cr
is the area of D. All the terms of the development
of H are then expressible
by repeated
integration
in terms of the kernel K alone.
This development
can serve to compute
H when K is known.
It will be
especially
useful when the domain
is such that the subspaces
21 and 21 of 53
THEORY OF REPRODUCING KERNELS
form a positive minimal angle. This is equivalent
to the fact that there exists
a constant
«ll/ll è ||/ +ÄII
for anyfQ 21, f G ¥.
It is easy to see that the last condition
is equivalent
to the following property of harmonic,
real-valued
||Â|| ^ c||ä||,
for some constant c > 0,
where A is the conjugate
of h (that is, h+ih
is analytic).
This property
can be proved
for domains
with a fairly smooth
(continuous
with at most a finite number
of angular
angles (see K. Friedrichs,
Consequently
we can apply
the kernel H for a rectangle,
which computation
would be especially useful in view of applications
to rectangular
elastic plates.
(2) We shall describe now a manner of applying our formula to calculate
the kernels K.
Let C be a closed set in the plane
(not necessarily
of twodimensional
0. Usually
C will be composed
of a finite number
arcs or closed curves. C decomposes
the plane in a certain number of domains
Di, D2, ■ • ■ which together
form an open set D. In D we consider the class of
21d formed
by all functions
which in each of the domains
and regular.
We call such functions
locally analytic
and the set C
their singular
We shall suppose further
that the functions
of 21 d have a finite norm given
||/||2 = J*Jj/(z)|2ei*eiy.
The class 21d possesses a r.k. KD which is simply expressible
by the Bergman's kernels Kon in the following way:
Kd(z, Zi) = KDn(z, Zi) if z and Zi belong to Dn,
Kd(z, Zi) — 0 if z and zx belong to two different D„'s.
There is no loss in generality
if we suppose
C is bounded
use conformai
to reduce every case to this one). We shall denote
by D0 the domain D„ containing
a decomposition
of C in two closed sets
C = C"> + G2>.
To every C(i) corresponds
the complementary
open set Dli> and we have
(I3) The author introduced
and investigated
this kind of function in his thesis in Paris .
N. ARONSZAJN
Every function /(s) locally analytic
in D is decomposable
into two functions /(z) =/i(z) +/2(z) each of which is locally analytic
in the corresponding
D(i) (see N. Aronszajn
 ). Two such decompositions
differ by a
with the singular
set C(1) • C(2).
The classes 2Irjw) are clearly linear closed subspaces
of 2Iz> (when we restrict
their functions
to the set D).
The intersection
of 2Idu) and 2Id(2) is equal to the class 21z>« where D* is the
complementary
set of C* = Cw ■ C<2).
The class 21d* is reduced
to 0 when the intersection
C* is a finite or an
enumerable
The equality
21D = Sfoi« e 2b<«
is not always true.
For simplicity's
sake we suppose now that C is not equal to 0 and is composed of a finite number
of rectifiable
arcs or closed curves,
not reduced
points, and that the same is true of C(1) and C(2).
It can then be proved
that the necessary and sufficient condition
that (6) be true is that C* = C^ ■ C'VO.
if C* = 0, then 2IbO[21du) ©2Ib(2)] is a one-dimensional
by the function
to'(z) defined
as follows: let A(z) ^Aecu.cw be the
locally harmonic
in D, taking
the value 1 on C(1) and 0 on C(2). Denote then by to(z) the function
locally analytic
in D (but not necessarily
single-valued
in the multiply-connected
components
Dn of D), whose real
part is A(z). The derivative
to'(z) =h'x — ih'v is single-valued
in D and belongs
to 2ti). A(z) is called the harmonic
in D corresponding
From what we said, it results that we shall be able to calculate
the kernel
Kb by the formulas
of §12 in the following
(1) When C*5¿0 and 2Íb«?í0 we can apply the general formula (7), §12, I,
translating
into kernels,
in particular
P, Po, Pi, and P2 into Kd,
KD', Kom, and KDm. To calculate
KD we have then to know KD-, K^m,
and Ffl(2).
(2) When CVO and 21j>-=(0) we can apply formula (18) §12, I.
This case contains
interesting
particular
cases; for instance
in the case of
a simply-connected
by a polygonal
line C. We can decompose Cinto one side C(1) and a polygonal
line C(2) having one side less than C.
This gives an inductive
process to calculate
the kernel KD of the open set
complementary
to C. By this process we obtain,
at the same time, the two
kernels for the interior
and exterior
of C. This is especially
interesting
