Emerging applications such as Internet of Everything, Holographic Telepresence, collaborative robots, and space and deep-sea tourism are already highlighting the limitations of existing
fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks. These limitations are in terms of data-rate, latency, reliability,
availability, processing, connection density and global coverage, spanning over ground, underwater and
space. The sixth-generation (6G) of mobile networks are expected to burgeon in the coming decade to
address these limitations. The development of 6G vision, applications, technologies and standards has
already become a popular research theme in academia and the industry. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the current developments towards 6G. We highlight the societal and technological
trends that initiate the drive towards 6G. Emerging applications to realize the demands raised by 6G
driving trends are discussed subsequently. We also elaborate the requirements that are necessary to realize
the 6G applications. Then we present the key enabling technologies in detail. We also outline current
research projects and activities including standardization efforts towards the development of 6G. Finally,
we summarize lessons learned from state-of-the-art research and discuss technical challenges that would

of 5G. This has motivated researchers to rethink and work
towards the next generation mobile communication networks

capabilities to cater to the demands of the future data-driven
So far, mobile networks have evolved through five generations during the last four decades. A new generation
of mobile networks emerges every ten years, packing
more technologies and capabilities to empower humans to
enhance their work and lifestyle. The pre-cellphone era
before the 1980s is marked as the zeroth-generation (0G) of
mobile communication networks that provided simple radio
communication functionality with devices such as walkietalkies . The first-generation (1G) introduced publicly
and commercially available cellular networks in the 1980s.
These networks provided voice communication using analog mobile technology . The Second Generation (2G) of
mobile communication networks marked the transition of
mobile networks from analog to digital. It supported basic
data services such as short message services in addition to
voice communication . The third-generation (3G) introduced improved mobile broadband services and enabled new
applications such as multimedia message services, video
calls, and mobile TV . Further improved mobile broadband services, all-IP communication, Voice Over IP (VoIP),
ultra high definition video streaming, and online gaming
were introduced in the fourth-generation (4G) (A list of
important acronyms is given in Table 1).
5G mobile communication networks are already being
worldwide.
Broadband (eMBB) to deliver peak data rates up to 10 Gbps.
Furthermore, ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication
(uRLLC) minimizes the delays up to 1 ms while massive
Machine Type Communication (mMTC) supports over 100x
more devices per unit area compared to 4G. The expected
network reliability and availability is over 99.999% .
Network softwarization is a prominent 5G technology that
enables dynamicity, programmability, and abstraction of
networks . Capabilities of 5G have enabled novel applications such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality
(AR), Mixed Reality (MR), autonomous vehicles, Internet
of Things (IoT), and Industry 4.0 , .
Recent developments in communications have introduced
many new concepts such as Edge Intelligence (EI), beyond
sub 6GHz to THz communication, Non-Orthogonal Multiple
Access (NOMA), Large Intelligent Surfaces (LIS), swarm
networks, and Self-Sustaining Networks (SSN) , .
These concepts are evolving to become fully-fledged technologies that can power future generations of communication networks. On the other hand, applications such as
Holographic Telepresence (HT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAV), Extended Reality (XR), smart grid 2.0, Industry
5.0, space and deep-sea tourism are expected to emerge as
mainstream applications of future communication networks.
However, requirements of these applications such as ultrahigh data rates, real-time access to powerful computing
resources, extremely low latency, precision localization and
sensing, and extremely high reliability and availability surpass the network capabilities promised by 5G , . IoT,

which is enabled by 5G, is even growing to become Internet
of Everything (IoE) that intends to connect massive numbers of sensors, devices, and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
beyond the capabilities of 5G. This has inspired the research
community to envision 6G mobile communication networks.
6G is expected to harness the developments of new communication technologies, fully support emerging applications,
connect a massive number of devices and provide real-time
access to powerful computational and storage resources.
A. 6G MOBILE COMMUNICATION NETWORKS

present understanding of 6G.
1) 6G AS ENVISIONED TODAY
6G mobile communication networks, as envisioned today, are
expected to provide extreme peak data rates over 1 Tbps.
The end-to-end delays will be imperceptible and lie even
beneath 0.1 ms. 6G networks will provide access to powerful
edge intelligence that has processing delays falling below
10 ns. Network availability and reliability are expected to go
beyond 99.99999%. An extremely high connection density of
over 107 devices/km2 is expected to be supported to facilitate
IoE. The spectrum efficiency of 6G will be over 5x than
5G, while support for extreme mobility up to 1000 kmph is
expected .
It is envisioned that the evolution of 6G will focus around
a myriad of new requirements such as Further enhanced
Mobile Broadband (FeMBB), ultra-massive Machine-Type
Communication (umMTC), Mobile BroadBand and Low-
Latency (MBBLL), and massive Low-Latency Machine
Type communication (mLLMT). These requirements will
be enabled through emerging technologies such as THz
spectrum, Federated Learning (FL), edge AI, Compressive
Sensing (CS), blockchain/Distributed Ledger Technologies
(DLT) and 3D networking. Moreover, 6G will facilitate
emerging applications such as UAVs, HT, IoE, Industry 5.0,
and collaborative autonomous driving. In light of this vision,
many new research work and projects are themed towards
developing 6G vision, technologies, use-cases, applications,
and standards , .

6G developments are expected to progress along with the
deployment and commercialization of 5G networks, and the
final developments of 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE), being
LTE-C, which followed LTE-Advanced and LTE-B .

II. KEY DRIVING TRENDS TOWARDS 6G
This section discusses the key 6G driving trends elaborating
why and how each trend is demanding a new generation of
communication networks. Fig. 4 illustrates the 6G driving
trends that are discussed in this section.
A. EXPANSION OF IOT TOWARDS IOE
IoT envisions to weave a global network of machines and
devices that are capable of interacting with each other .
The number of IoT devices are on the rise and is expected
to grow up to 24 billion by 2030 due to the growth of
applications such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).
The total IoT market is also expected to rise up to USD 1.5
trillion in 2030 . IoE is expected to expand the scope
of IoT to form a hyper-connected world connecting people,
data and things to streamline the processes of businesses and
industries while enriching human lives . IoE will connect
many ecosystems involving heterogeneous sensors, actuators,
user equipment, data types, services, and applications .
Importance of the Driving Trend: Importance of this driving
trend is discussed considering the challenges in overcoming the limitations of existing networks to facilitate IoT
development towards IoE. One of the key challenges in this
development is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
and Machine Learning (ML) technologies to mobile communication networks . These technologies are essential
to process massive amounts of data collected from heterogeneous IoE devices to obtain meaningful information
and enable new applications, and use-cases envisioned with
6G . Processing massive amounts of data using AI and ML
requires future communication networks to provide real-time
access to powerful computational facilities. The communication between IoE devices and mobile networks should also be
power efficient to minimize the carbon footprint. For instance,
intelligent traffic control and transportation systems in future
smart cities are expected to utilize future 6G communication
networks to massively exploit data-driven methods for realtime optimization . Such systems will require AI and ML
to efficiently process large amounts of data collected from
heterogeneous sensors in real-time to provide insights that
will be useful to minimize traffic.
Preserving data security and privacy in existing IoT
networks is yet another important requirement. Since everything in IoE is connected to the Internet, distributed AI
technologies will be required for training data-sets spread
unevenly across multiple edge devices. This exposes IoE
networks to security vulnerabilities associated with distributed AI such as poisoning attacks and authentication
issues . Solving these issues require AI and DLT based
adaptive security solutions that should be integrated with
future communication networks . DLTs, blockchain in
particular, is a key enabler of IoE. The decentralized operation, immutability and enhanced security of blockchain are
instrumental in overcoming the challenges concerned with
the exponential expansion of IoT . Moreover, traditional
Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) based schemes cannot provide access to a massive number of IoE devices
due to limitations in the radio spectrum. This requires
new technologies such as NOMA to be applied to cellular IoT to provide access to a massive number of IoT
devices , . In addition, providing seamless connectivity to IoE devices that lie beyond the coverage of
terrestrial cellular networks requires UAV and satellites to
work in coordination to form a cognitive satellite-UAV
network . Such technologies are expected to be integrated with the next-generation of mobile communication
networks to facilitate the smooth progression from IoT
towards IoE.

FIGURE 3. Structure and the outline of this paper.
B. MASSIVE AVAILABILITY OF SMALL DATA
The term “Small Data” refers to small data sets representing
a limited pool of data in a niche area of interest . Such
data sets can provide meaningful insights to manage massive amounts of IoT devices. Unlike Big Data that concerns
with large sets of historical data, Small Data is concerned
about either real-time data or statistical data of a limited time.
Small Data will be instrumental in many applications, including the real-time equipment operation and the maintenance
of massive numbers of machines connected in IIoT. IIoT is
expected to grow connecting billions of CPS, devices, and
sensors in the coming decade as discussed in Section II-A.
Another example is the growing demand for Small Data
based analytics in the retail industry that collects data from
various sensors, personal wearables, and IoT devices .
Such analytics are useful to provide real-time personalized
services for customers. These applications give rise to the
generation of massive amounts of small data sets that should
be efficiently collected and processed using AI and ML .
Importance of the Driving Trend: The importance of this
driving trend is discussed considering the processing and
communication limitations of existing mobile communication networks. Processing massive amounts of Small Data
sets is not efficient in existing cloud computing and edge
computing infrastructure, that is designed to process large
data sets . This requires new means of efficiently processing massive amounts of Small Data sets in the Edge
AI infrastructure in future communication networks. This
will also require new ML techniques beyond classical big
data analytics to enhance network functions and provide new
services envisaged in future communication networks .
Furthermore, future networks should maximize the energyefficiency of offloading massive amounts of Small Data to
edge computing facilities. This requires the optimization
VOLUME 2, 2021

FIGURE 4. 6G Driving Trends , .
of joint radio and computation resources while satisfying the maximum tolerable delay constraints . On the
other hand, communication networks will need to support
massive amounts of Small Data transmission from heterogeneous IoT devices. Overheads of this type of communication
can be significant compared to the size of data that is
being transmitted, making this type of data communication less efficient , . This requires new methods
to reduce transmission and contention overheads in future
communication networks.
C. AVAILABILITY OF SELF-SUSTAINING NETWORKS
SSNs can perform tasks such as self-managing, selfplanning, self-organizing, self-optimizing, self-healing, and
self-protecting network resources to continuously maintain
its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) . This is performed by adapting network operation and functionalities
considering various facts, including environmental status,
network usage, and energy constraints . These types
of intelligent and real-time network operations in SSNs
are facilitated using machine learning/deep learning/quantum
machine learning techniques that enable fast learning of
rapid network changes and dynamic user requirements .
Using SSNs, future networks are expected to enable seamless access to emerging application domains under highly
dynamic and complex environments .
Importance of the Driving Trend: The importance of this
driving trend is discussed considering the incapability of
existing mobile networks to function as SSNs. SSNs require
the ability to obtain network statistics in real-time to automatically manage resources and adapt functionalities to
maintain high KPIs . Therefore, SSNs require a novel
self-sustaining network architecture that can adapt to rapid
changes in the environment and user requirements. These
operations should be facilitated through real-time analysis of
massive amounts of Small Data obtained by network nodes.
Small Data analysis can be performed using edge intelligence capabilities envisaged in future networks, as explained
in Section II-B. Furthermore, self-optimization of radio
resources needs to bank on software-defined cognitive radios
through operations such as radio scene analysis , .
In addition, SSNs should facilitate energy self-sustainability
at the infrastructure side as well as the device side to
provide uninterrupted and seamless connectivity. Therefore,
energy harvesting in network infrastructure should play a pivotal role to extend the range and stand-by times , .
This also requires future communication networks to be
designed in an energy-aware fashion to enable devices
to harvest energy, be self-powered, share power and last
long , . Furthermore, handling massive numbers of
IoT devices in an energy-efficient manner under various
channel conditions and diverse applications requires selflearning through context-aware operation to minimize the
energy per bit for a given communication requirement .
D. CONVERGENCE OF COMMUNICATIONS,
COMPUTING, CONTROL, LOCALIZATION,
AND SENSING (3CLS)
Future communication networks are expected to converge
computing resources, controlling architecture and other
infrastructure used for precise localization and sensing .
This convergence is essential to facilitate highly personalized and time-critical future applications. For instance,
Human-Centric Services (HCS) are expected to bank on
3CLS services to facilitate efficient communication and realtime processing of a large number of data streams gathered
through sensors that are centered around humans , .
Importance of the Driving Trend: The development of
3CLS services is an important driving trend towards the
next generation of mobile communication networks as
existing 5G technologies has not fully explored the interdependence between computing, communication, control,
localization, and sensing in an end-to-end manner .
VOLUME 2, 2021
Realizing 3CLS services will require future mobile communication networks to possess collective network intelligence
at the edge of the network to run AI and ML algorithms
in real-time , . Moreover, the network architecture
should also be open, scalable, and elastic to facilitate an
AI orchestrated end-to-end 3CLS design services , .
Precise localization and sensing should also coexist with
communication networks by sharing network resources in
time, frequency, and space to facilitate emerging applications such as extended reality, connected robotics, CAVs,
sensing, and 3D mapping , .
E. ZERO ENERGY IOT
Zero energy IoT devices can harvest energy from the environment to obtain infinite power . For instance, Radio
Frequency (RF) energy harvesting can harvest energy from
RF waves to extend the network lifetime. Nodes that harvest more energy can share their energy with other nodes
using energy cooperation. Presently, only about 0.6% of
the 1.5 trillion objects in the real world are connected to
the Internet . The remaining devices are also expected
to be connected in an energy efficient fashion together
with the growth of future communication technologies and
applications.
Importance of the Driving Trend: Zero energy IoT is
an important driving trend towards future communication
networks to enable maintenance-free and battery-less operation of a massive number of IoT devices. This requires
mobile networks to be able to support ultra-low-power communication and efficient energy harvesting . However,
existing 5G network infrastructures do not support energy
harvesting, especially as the electronic circuitry cannot efficiently convert the harvested energy into electric current .
Therefore, the electronic circuitry in future communication
networks should be designed and developed to support efficient energy harvesting. Furthermore, circuits that harvest
energy should allow devices to be self-powered to enable offgrid operations, long-lasting IoT devices, and longer stand-by
times . Wireless power transfer is also expected to play
a key role in the next generation of mobile communication
networks considering the feasibility of doing so due to much
shorter communication distances in denser communication
networks . Furthermore, data communication stacks can
also be optimized in an energy-aware fashion to minimize
energy usage.
F. ADVANCEMENT OF COMMUNICATION
TECHNOLOGIES
Mobile communication has seen significant technological
advances recently. For instance, electromagnetically active
Large Intelligent Surfaces (LIS) made using meta-materials
placed in walls, roads, buildings and other smart environments with integrated electronics will provide massive
surfaces for wireless communication . Furthermore,
novel channel access schemes such as NOMA have found to
Advancement of communication technologies towards 6G , – .
provide many advantages such as being more spectral efficient compared to prevailing schemes. Beyond millimeter
Wave (mmWave) communication at THz frequency bands
are also being exploited to provide uninterrupted connectivity in local and wide area networks . Key advancements
of communication technologies are illustrated in Fig. 5.
Importance of the Driving Trend: The emergence of new
communication technologies that cannot be integrated with
existing 5G networks is discussed to highlight the importance
of this driving trend. For instance, future communication
networks will need to shift from existing small cells towards
tiny cells to support high-frequency bands in the THz
spectrum. This requires a new architectural design supporting denser network deployments and mobility management
at higher frequencies . Furthermore, multi-mode base
stations will be necessary to facilitate networks to operate in a wide range of spectra ranging from microwave
to THz to provide uninterrupted connectivity. Furthermore,
utilizing LISs as transceivers require low-complexity channel demodulation banking on techniques such as joint CS
and deep learning, which is not feasible with 5G .
Also, none of the recent advancements in communication technologies such as providing AI powered network
functionalities using collective network intelligence, Visible
Light Communication (VLC), NOMA, cell-free networks,
and quantum computing and communications are realized in
5G , , . Therefore, integration of these advanced
communication technologies demands a new paradigm of
mobile communication networks.
G. GADGET-FREE COMMUNICATION
Gadget free communication eliminates the requirement for a
user to hold physical communication devices. It is envisaged
that the digital services centered around smart and connected gadgets will move towards a user-centric gadget-free
communication model as more and more digital interfaces,
intelligent devices and sensors get integrated to the environment , . Since most of our data and services
are already based on cloud platforms, the move towards a
ubiquitous gadget-free environment seems to be the natural
VOLUME 2, 2021
ALWIS et al.: SURVEY ON 6G FRONTIERS: TRENDS, APPLICATIONS, REQUIREMENTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND FUTURE RESEARCH
progression. The hyper-connected smart digital surroundings
will provide an omnipotential environment around the user
to provide the all the digital services needed in their everyday life. Hence, in the future, any user can live naked, i.e.,
users can access Internet based services without any personal
devices, gadgets or wearables .
Importance of the Driving Trend: The limitations of
present 5G network technologies to facilitate gadget-free
communication also highlights it as an important driving
trend towards the next-generation of networks. Gadget-free
communication requires users to stay connected seamlessly
with high availability, high network performance, increased
energy efficiency and lower costs. This requires future
communication networks to be highly automated, contextaware, adaptable, flexible, secure and self-configurable to
provide users with a satisfactory service . Facilitating
such requirements demands future communication networks
to be equipped with powerful distributed computing with
edge intelligence, which is lacking in present 5G implementation . Future networks are also required to facilitate
extreme data-rates, negligible latencies, and extreme reliability to facilitate holographic communication that will enable
users to fully utilize the potential of gadget-free communication . Furthermore, existing measures for network
security and privacy also needs to be improved. For instance,
efficient, secure and privacy, ensuring authentication mechanisms using lightweight operations are required to be
integrated with future communication networks to facilitate
gadget-free communication .
H. INCREASING ELDERLY POPULATION
The world’s older population continues to grow exponentially due to advance healthcare facilities, life prospects, and
access to new medicine and healthcare facilities. Presently,
there are more 60-year olds than children under the age of
five, and this trend is expected to grow . The World
Health Organization (WHO) in 2015 has also predicted
that the elderly populations will double from 12% to 22%
by 2050 . The elderly population is prone to old-age
diseases. Thus, they need continuous health monitoring to
ensure well-being. However, frequent hospital visits might
not be a feasible solution due to costs, transportation difficulties, and body movement restrictions. This requires
technologies to aid physicians to manage their patients in
real-time while measuring parameters such as heart rate,
body and skin temperature, blood pressure, respiration rate
and physical activity using multiple wearable devices and
environmental sensors . Concepts such as Human Bond
Communication (HBC) are developing to detect and transmit
information using all five human senses (sight, smell, sound,
touch, and taste) . Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is
another developing concept that will allow remote monitoring of health as well as other hazards such as smoke or
fire .
Importance of the Driving Trend: The importance of
increasing elderly population as an emerging trend is
identified considering the limitations of existing network
infrastructure to provide smart healthcare and other related
facilities to the increasing elderly population. It is observed
that the requirements of future healthcare applications can
extend up to very high data rates, extremely high reliability (99.99999%), and extremely low end-to-end delays
(≤1 ms) , . Furthermore, emerging applications
such as Intelligent Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT)
requires powerful edge intelligence to process massive
amounts of data in real-time for early detection of adverse
medical conditions such as cancers. Similarly, Hospital-to-
Home (H2H) services that can provide urgent treatments
for patients will also require seamless connectivity with
extreme reliability . In addition, VLC is expected to be
integrated with mobile networks to facilitate in-body sensors to provide vital information for patient monitoring .
Moreover, the massive amounts of health information that
will be gathered should be protected by future networks with
powerful and intelligent measures to ensure data security
and user privacy , . These requirements are beyond
5G capabilities and demand a new generation of mobile
communication networks.
I. EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS
The advancement of technologies will enable many novel
and resource-intensive applications by connecting over 125
billion devices worldwide by the year 2030 . For
instance, XR technologies are expected to play a significant role in many applications, including Brain Computer
Interfaces (BCI), smart healthcare and education . HT is
another key area that is envisaged to grow and teleport users
to create a sense of presence in virtual spaces . Similarly,
synergistic use of machines and people labor together with
AI is envisioned to enhance human capabilities and personalize autonomous manufacturing in Industry 5.0 , .
On the other hand, the evolution of smart grids will give
rise to Internet of Energy that will monitor and control heterogeneous energy sources and energy storage systems .
CAVs will be another popular application that will utilize
data gathered from heterogenous sensors to provide vital
information related to navigation, passenger safety, road
safety, and passenger infotainment . UAVs is another
area that is expected to grow from being a 19.3 billion USD
industry in 2019 up to 45.8 billion USD by 2025 .
1) IMPORTANCE AS A DRIVING TREND
Emerging technologies and applications is another important driving trend towards the next-generation of networks.
According to , present 5G network technologies are not
capable of delivering the extreme data-rates, extreme reliability, extreme-availability, extreme low-delays and massive
scalability demanded by emerging technologies and applications. For instance, utilizing XR technologies in BCI applications will require over 1 Tbps data rates . Furthermore,
a raw hologram used in HT applications requires over 4
Tbps data rates with sub-millisecond latency . These
VOLUME 2, 2021
FIGURE 6. Emerging 6G Applications.
applications demand extreme reliability and extreme availability (> 99.99999%). Also, applications such as CAVs
demand up to 1000 km/h mobility . Seamless communication between billions of Internet connected devices is
essential for emerging IoE applications. Furthermore, future
networks are also expected to have significantly better energy
efficiencies than 5G to facilitate lower-costs, massive scalability and lower carbon footprint. Additionally, existing 5G
networks are also not designed to handle unique security vulnerabilities such as paging occasion and stingrays in UAV
applications . Therefore, a new generation of networks
is required to address all these limitations of 5G networks
to facilitate emerging technologies and applications towards
the 2030 world.
III. 6G APPLICATIONS
The above discussed trends will motivate the development
of a wide range of new applications to shape the human
society of 2030s. This section discusses some of the key
emerging applications that will bank on future 6G network
capabilities, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Requirements of each
application discussed in this section are presented in Table 3.
A. INTERNET OF EVERYTHING (IOE)
IoE is an extended version of IoT that includes, things,
data, people, and processes , . The main concept
of IoE is to integrate various sensing devices that can be
related to “everything” for identifying, monitoring the status, and taking decisions in an intelligent manner to create
new prospects. Sensors in IoE are capable of acquiring many
parameters such as velocity, position, light, bio-signals, pressure, and temperature readings. These sensors are used in
applications ranging from healthcare systems, smart cities,
traffic to industrial domain to facilitate decision support
6G is expected to become a key enabler for the IoE that
will help in accommodating massive machine type communication and sensor devices , . The integration of
6G and IoE will be helpful in improving the services related
Internet of Things, Internet of Medical Things, robots, smart
grids, smart city, body sensor networks, and many more
It can also be predicted that many new applications will
emerge from the fusion of IoE and 6G communication .
However, IoE is expected to be dependent on 6G as it
requires the capacity to connect N-intelligent devices where
N term is scalable and can reach to billions. Moreover, IoE
also needs the high data rates to support and facilitate the
N number of devices with low latency . Therefore, IoE
and 6G together can facilitate the business processes to not
only create magnitudes of data but also to re-invent the
digitalization with improved and agile data analytics.
1) RELATED WORK
A number of researchers have explored the potential of 6G
in a rhetorical way. Saad et al. presented the associated
applications and trends that can be potentially enhanced with

TABLE 3. Expected 6G applications requirements , .
the use of 6G communication. The study also discusses the
key enabling technologies and research problems, which 6G
systems might face in its realization phase. A similar study
was carried out by Chowdhury et al. , which discussed
the challenges associated with 6G systems along with potential applications. Both of these studies present IoE as the key
enabler for 6G communication systems. Yang et al. also
conducted a similar study but with the focus on potential
techniques that could be used to bring the 6G systems closer
to commercialization. This study also emphasizes on super
flexible integrated networks which can help 6G systems to
be applicable in variety of applications including IoE.
Al-Turjman focused on the potential sensors that can
be employed for the integration of IoE and 6G communication systems from physical and electronic communication
point of views. Janbi et al. proposed a distributed AI as a
service (DAIaaS) framework by integrating IoE and 6G characteristics. The evaluation showed that the DAIaaS can help
in reducing the inference time while allowing the developers to systemize the automation process. Mardini et al. 
proposed a IPv6 routing protocol for lossy networks and
low-power systems based on the IoE and 6G networks.
The study suggests that similar nodes representing a common objective can be considered as an instance and such
instances can be used with Low-Power and Lossy Networks
(RPL) for enhancing the performance of healthcare systems,
accordingly.
Summary: The IoE requires uninterruptible and massive
low-latency communication in order to facilitate things,
services, and people in a single integrated framework.
B. SMART GRID 2.0
Smart Grid 2.0 integrates intelligent decision systems with
the smart meters in a way that the consumption could be
monitored accurately. Moreover, smart grid 2.0 also includes
the goal of detecting outages, sensing of power quality,
demand response, and network connectivity to cater to the
ever increasing energy demand , .
Since the inception of smart grid development, communication has been one of the challenges as large number of
devices are ought to be connected in order to monitor and
control the electrical equipment from remote locations .
For realization of such control strategy, the system needs high
quality transmission, security, and administration of communication resources. All the physical objects such as towers,
transformers and other components need to be detected
and monitored for the provision of effective services and
reliable supply . 5G communication meets with the
requirement of low-latency and high bandwidth so far with
limited number of devices in order to commercialize the
VOLUME 2, 2021
smart grid project. However, if we are concerned about the
diversification and the ramifications of climate change, 6G
communication systems are required to fulfil the need .
For instance, monitoring CO2 emissions require sensors to
be connected and integrated with decision systems such as
machine learning, so that the appropriate load balancing and
distribution measures can be taken .
1) RELATED WORK
The works combining 6G and smart grids are quite limited due to the lack of available data and hypothetical
situations. Khan et al. explored potential applications
and advancements related to 6G communication systems
including computing, networking, communication, and keyenabling technologies. One of the explored applications was
zero-energy-enabled 6G which suggests the integration of
radio-frequency and renewable sources for harvesting energy.
The idea is to monitor the excessive energy being utilized
by radio frequency so that the same amount of energy could
be harvested and sent back to the grid, hence, zero-energy.
Ho et al. carried out a survey for discussing the implications and solutions for smart grids in conjunction with 5G
communication systems. However, the study provides a brief
vision for leveraging 6G system characteristics to improve
the smart grid performance. Katz et al. considered the
ideas from 6Genesis flagship program (6GFP) proposed by
Finnish industrial and academic consortium for hypothetically bridging the ecosystem and smart society with 6G
communication systems. The study focuses on ultra-reliable
low latency communication and mobile edge computing
aspects of 6G communication to be the key enablers for
smart grid applications. Dang et al. proposed a systematic framework for the 6G applications and subdivided them
based on their key features. The study suggests that the smart
grids might leverage 6G characteristics in a way that the
users will be able to generate energy more than the required
capacity and can sell the residual electricity to the companies, accordingly. Similar studies hypothetically suggest the
concept of using distributive techniques such as blockchain
along with 6G communication systems to improve the smart
grid performance – .
Summary: There are various implications of smart grid
such as heterogeneous renewable sources, load balancing,
efficient distribution, and more, that expect to progress to
its realization with the integration of 6G communication
C. HOLOGRAPHIC TELEPRESENCE
realistic,
full-motion,
threedimensional (3D) images of distant people and objects with a
high level of realism rivaling of the physical presence . It
can be used for full-motion, 3D video conferencing and news
broadcasting or TED talk like applications , . HT
captures footage of people and surrounding objects, which
are compressed and transmitted over a broadband network, in
the initial stage. Later, the transmitted information is decompressed at the receiver’s end and projected with the aid of
laser beams . HT helps to minimize business travel costs,
and allows people to appear in many locations simultaneously, while tactile and interactive content are key factors to
engage the audience. On the other hand, there are some road
blocking factors in the path of adopting the HT technology.
Ultra low latency (1 ms) and high data rate of 10 Gbps
are some of the core challenges partially covered by the
5G. For complete immersive uninterruptible experience, 6G
with latency of 0.1 ms and data rates of multi Gbps is
required .
1) RELATED WORK
Holographic communication is based on multi-view camera image communication that demands significantly higher
data rates . This is possible with 5G with several restrictions including dedicated network resources and limited or
no mobility . The human propensity to communicate
remotely with high fidelity will raise significant connectivity challenges for the next-generation network, i.e., 6G. The
authors in discussed the details of a 3D holographic display’s data rate requirements: a raw hologram will require
4.32 Tbps, without any compression, with colors, high parallax, and 30 fps. As compared to the few needed for VR/AR,
the latency requirement will reach 0.1 ms. In addition, all
the 5 human senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste)
are intended to be digitized and transmitted through future
networks to completely realize an immersive remote experience , raising the total target data rate. Using 5G,
such communications are infeasible, because they require
data rates in the order of Tbps , , .
Summary: A successful HT application is evaluated by
the seamless and quality of connection between users, which
requires massive low-latency and extremely high data rate.
The foundation of 6G communication is based on the provision of aforementioned connection characteristics which
makes 6G a key-enabler for the said service.
D. UAV BASED MOBILITY
UAVs have been used extensively for defense applications
such as remotely controlled aircraft, autonomous drones,
and so forth . Over the years, the application of
UAVs have been expanded in military as well as civil field.
For instance, UAVs have been proposed for disaster relief,
agricultural plant protection, traffic monitoring, and environmental detection . UAVs are also expected to be an
essential module for future wireless technologies such as 6G,
which supports high data rate transmission for communities
living remotely, facing disaster situations such as earthquake,
terrorist attacks, and with no typical cellular infrastructure
presence. Key features associated with UAV’s as compared to
the fixed infrastructure are: easy deployability, line-of-sight
(LoS) connectivity , and most importantly, controlled mobility. The rapid development of UAV technologies
will penetrate new domain such as passenger taxi, automated

logistics and military operations . With the emergence
of 6G and IoE, researchers have explored the use of UAVto-Everything (U2X) network that expands the paradigm of
sensing applications by adjusting the communication modes
to their full potential . One of the key challenges for
the integration of 6G, IoE, and UAVs as U2X networks is
the design of radio resource management, and joint transmission and sensing protocol for its realization. In terms of
application, the biggest challenge of the U2X networks is
the trajectory design, which will be domain specific. For
instance, trajectory design for passenger taxis and provision
of cellular infrastructure would have different dynamics and
need to be designed as per the application requirements.
1) RELATED WORK
In the telecommunications sector, increasing UAV applications such as relay BSs, live data streaming and communication gateways are expected to model the growth in the
UAV market . The possible role of UAVs in a hot zone,
congested areas and as a relay-BSs makes it an inherent part
of , the next-generation networking infrastructure.
Liu et al. , for the first time made a breakthrough using
UAV for quantum communication. They revealed a quantum network of UAV-based distribution of entanglements.
Many resources have lately been committed to the design
of ultra flexible interconnected networks. In particular, the
Flying Base Station (FBS) aided dynamic networks may
be designed to boost the traditional static structure, as discussed in , the growing number and types of aerial
vehicles, such as balloons, airships, and UAV. For example, several various FBS initiatives have appeared in recent
years, with Google’s Loon project using airborne UAVs (balloons) to deliver consistent Internet services to remote and
rural areas. In the near future, Amazon’s prime air initiative will shortly launch a UAV-based frequent parcel delivery
system . Some work initiated by Nokia and Qualcomm,
i.e., 5G drone project, currently performing numerous tests
using UAVs , for next-generation communication.
Summary: With the integration of 6G with AI, some
major problems associated with UAV based mobility such
as efficient route planning and power transfer expected to
be resolved.
E. EXTENDED REALITY
XR is an emerging immersive technology with the fusion of
physical and virtual worlds where wearables and computers
generate human-machine interactions , . The fab
four (AR, VR, MR, XR) technologies use different sensors
to collect data regarding the location, orientation and acceleration. This requires strong connectivity, extreme data rates,
high resolution and extreme low latency, that is envisioned
to be facilitated 6G.
1) RELATED WORK
Latency plays a key role in all of the VR, AR, MR and XR
technologies. This empowers the real time user interaction
in the immersive environment to meet the demand of massive low latency, data rate needs to touch Tbps rather than
Gbps in 5G. Authors in discussed that a truly XR experience is not only possible with the engineering (wireless,
computing, storage) functionalities but it also need perceptual requirements stemming from human senses, cognition,
and physiology. Liao et al. highlighted the issues of
resource requirements, faster data rates, and scalability of
devices for services related to virtual and augmented reality. The study proposed an information-centric massive IoT
based method that could guarantee the required quality of
service in 6G networks. The paradigm concerning AR/VR
services has been shifted to edge computing and caching for
faster responses and managing the communication resources.
Authors in discuss challenges, opportunities and applications for the aforementioned paradigm shift. However,
authors in proposed a novel architecture that uses
UAV based clustering for multi-task multi-modal offloading
and managing the communication, caching, and computing
resources in an efficient manner.
Summary: Similar to the HT, extended reality also requires
massive low-latency and extremely high data rate for the
efficient service provision. With the integration of AI and
compressed sensing approaches, 6G is expected to provide uninterruptible and seamless communication services
for better XR experience.
F. CONNECTED AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE
Both academia and industry sectors have drawn substantial interest in next generation transportation systems
such as autonomous driving, cooperative vehicle networks,
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) , , Vehicular Ad-hoc
NETworks (VANETs), air-to-ground networks, and spaceair-ground interconnected networks . Particularly, AIenabled future vehicle networks that has benefited from
these vehicle-related operations paves the way for future
6G Intelligent Transport System (ITS) and intelligent V2X
communications. A rare potential for a radical shift in urban
transportation is the advent of CAVs. Such innovation could
lead to the development of cities that are productive, more
sustainable and greener. It is expected that more companies
will be investing in CAVs with the advent of 6G that surely
will bring truly autonomous, reliable, safe and commercially
viable driverless cars in near future. When this happens, new
ecosystem will emerge such as driver-less taxi and driver-less
public transport, which will make everyday life more comfortable , . 6G expected to satisfy the more rigorous
KPIs which 5G partially fulfilled for vehicle communication
to unleash the full capacity of CAVs, such as extremely high
reliability, exceptionally low latency (0.1 ms),and extremely
high throughput .
1) RELATED WORK
It is envisioned that various key technologies such as 6G, AI,
DLT will be integral part of CAV . CAV applications
such as smart cooperative platooning, smart intersections,
VOLUME 2, 2021
and cooperative vision that can greatly boost road safety and
efficiency, fuel usage and congestion, . To realize above
mentioned applications, researchers worked on several key
areas such as location prediction based scheduling and routing was studied in , , using different methodologies; hidden markov models, variable-order markov
models, and recursive least squares respectively. Other factors such as network congestion control , , load
balancing , network security , virtual resource
allocation , resource management , , and distributed resource management , were explored using
various machine learning approaches such as reinforcement learning, k-means clustering, long short term memory
networks (LSTM), and feed forward neural networks.
Summary: Autonomous vehicles heavily rely on the connection based on extreme low-latency along with AI based
techniques to provide efficient route planning and decision making. However, the problems with connection-less
services is the grant-free communication that has been extensively explored in 5G communication systems. It is to be
believed that with the emergence of 6G services, the communication protocols for grant-free access will be more efficient
and seamless, accordingly.
G. INDUSTRY 5.0
Industry 5.0 refers to people working alongside robots and
smart machines to add a personal human touch to Industry
4.0 pillars of automation and efficiency . Similar to
Industry 4.0, cloud/edge computing, big data, AI, 6G, and
IoE are expected to be the key-enabling technologies of
Industry 5.0 . In particular, a massive number of things
in Industry 5.0 are connected either using wired or wireless
technologies to provide various applications and services
that are enabled by a complete integration of cloud/edge
computing, big data, and AI.
1) RELATED WORK
Although there are no precise definition and standard of 6G,
much effort has been dedicated to investigate the role of
6G systems and technologies in solving the issues and challenges in Industry 5.0. Recognized by many studies, Industry
5.0 is considered as an important use case in 6G, where
not only communication, but also computation, caching,
control, and intelligence are jointly optimized . With
a huge amount data generated by massive things, robots
is likely to become more intelligent due to the advent of
AI and 6G wireless systems. For example, the impedance
of robots is optimized via a joint use of control theory
and imitation learning , and the proposed approach
is shown to have superior performance of tracking error
and the interaction forces over two benchmarks schemes.
As emerging applications requires a very high reliability
and very low latency, e.g., tele-surgery, massive production, and autonomous decision-making manufacturing, 6G
is a potential solution as massive uRLLC solutions will be
available in 5G , . Since a huge volume of data is
generated by industrial robots and sensors, only processing
the data at the central cloud is not an effective solution,
and this demands a need for coordination with computing
nodes at the network edge , . Moreover, 6G with
many promising technologies such as wireless power transfer, energy harvesting, and backscatter communications will
provide sustainable solutions for energy-limited sensors and
robots in Industry 5.0.
Summary: As both Industry 5.0 and 6G networks are still
under development, we can expect that there will be more
research works their integration and applications in practice.
H. HYPER-INTELLIGENT IOT
Next generation of hyper-intelligent IoT applications will utilize AI methods to optimize the processing of data and also
integrate novel robotic devices, UAVs and digital assistants
to deliver more smart and intelligent services . It is
imperative because massive IoT devices will be connected
to the Internet and with each other, and therefore a huge
amount of mobile data is generated that should be intelligently processed at the network edge. In 4G/5G systems, the
typical workflow for IoT data processing invloves sending
data to an access point at the edge, which then processes
the received data and/or forwards the data to the central
cloud for further processing. However, the current network
generation is not able to support IoT data processing in various circumstances when the network becomes ultra-dense
and when wireless connections are not available, of which
examples are mountains areas, hard-to-reach locations, IoT
applications in marine and aerial environments. Providing
intelligent and always-available solutions for hyper-dense
IoT expedite the research and development of beyond 5G
and future 6G networks.
1) RELATED WORK
According to , the total data traffic generated by applications, machines, and things at the edge is 850 ZB, whereas
the total data center traffic is only 20.6 ZB. As a result,
enabling intelligence at the network edge (also known as
edge AI or edge intelligence) has the potential to provide
diverse feasible solutions and applications for hyper-dense
IoT. For example, a communication-efficient approach based
FL is proposed in to efficiently process IoT data at
the edge, but with data privacy preservation. Another example can be found in , where deep neural networks
are employed in a three-layer manner, IoT device-edge-and
cloud, in order to process IoT data. However, the concept
of edge intelligence is still in its infancy stage and many
(non-)technical challenges should be solved such as resourcefriendly AI design and novel incentive models . To
complement the terrestrial network, aerial and satellite communications are considered as important components in 6G
systems . The ground-aerial-satellite network architecture is very promising as it can provide a seamless coverage
over the globe and enable various emerging applications with
different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements , .
VOLUME 2, 2021
ALWIS et al.: SURVEY ON 6G FRONTIERS: TRENDS, APPLICATIONS, REQUIREMENTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND FUTURE RESEARCH
As illustrated in , deploying data centers and clouds in
the satellites is a promising solution for intelligently processing IoT data of geo-distributed applications such as precision
agriculture and remote surveillance services.
Summary: A number of research works have been
developed for hyper-intelligent IoT solutions. However, most
existing works focus on the 5G network scenarios such
as deep learning for hierarchical edge computing systems
in . More studies are necessary to explore the potential
of 6G and better exploit massive amounts of data.
I. COLLABORATIVE ROBOTS
Collaborative robots (cobots in short) are directly collaborate with people by work side-by-side with humans. These
cobots take over tedious, repetitive and risky tasks to maintain human worker’s health and safety and automate the
production lines . Although cobots can offer various
benefits, enabling cobots in Industry 5.0 demands revolutionary solutions of reliability, safety, and trust. Moreover, cobots
should process huge data and make decision in real-time to
support emerging applications, which is however not practical in many case due to the limitation in storage capacity,
and computing and communication connections. This work
is motivated by the fact that processing data of individual
source such as radars, wearable devices, and vision equipment is not very efficient, whereas a multi-sensory fusion
technique can achieve superior performance in terms of
accuracy-delay tradeoff and human-cobot minimal distance.
1) RELATED WORK
A number of promising research works have been investigated to improve the performance of cobot systems. For
example, Kianoush et al. proposed an edge-cloud
framework to protect workers in human-robot interaction
environments, via a joint processing approach of multisensory data collected from various sensing and IoT devices.
In , the concept of cobot and wireless charging is integrated into a holistic system. In particular, a single robot is
deployed to wirelessly power nearby electric devices and the
computation workload of the robot is offloaded to the cloud
for remote processing. However, this system is required to
be pre-trained in an offline manner before real deployment.
With the advent of AI and mobile broadband connections in
6G, it is expected that the robot can learn online and then
the accuracy/efficiency of the system can be significantly
Summary: Despite a key enabler, there are a limited number of studies on cobots in the context of beyond 5G and
6G networks. Enabled the capabilities of 3CLS services, the
performance and applications of cobots can be improved
significantly.
J. PERSONALIZED BODY AREA NETWORKS
Body Area Networks (BANs) with integrated mobile Health
(mHealth) systems are advancing towards the personalized health monitoring and management. Such personalized
BANs can collect health information from multiple sensors, dynamically exchange the such information with the
environment and interact with networking services including social networks . Personalized BANs has a wide
range of applications, covering both medical to non-medical
domains. For example, personalized BANs can be used to
avoid the need of cable wiring in polysomnography tests
(also known as sleep disorder diagnosis). Personalized BANs
has also found in non-medical applications such as emotion
detection, entertainment, and secure authentication applications . More recently, the Internet of Nano-Things
(IoNT) and the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) have
been developed as the next generation of IoT for healthcare
services. The concept of IoBNT engineers information communication within the biochemical domain, while connecting
to the Internet via the electrical domain .
1) RELATED WORK
Despite various applications, IoBNT is still in the infant stage
of research and development. In order to realize IoBNT, some
efforts have been denoted to the design of nano-sensors.
Graphene membranes are utilized to develop highly-sensitive
capacitive nanomechanical sensors, which are shown to
have a superior responsivity over the commercial nanosensors . From the wireless communication perspective,
Akyildiz et al. pointed out several significant challenges in IoNT and IoBNT such as energy consumption,
interference control, network and routing protocols, coding
scheme and modulation technique, experimental validation,
and data management. The features of 6G such as high data
rate, reliability, new spectrum (visible light and THz) communications, and ultra-low latency will help to address these
challenges, along with other efforts from existing studies for
IoNT and IoBNT.
In , the human insulin-glucose system is analyzed
in terms of the data rate, channel capacity, and propagation delay, and from the communication perspective.
Several characteristics of the correlation between insulin
rate/resistance and the derived models are illustrated via
the experimental results. Due to the diffusion and attenuation properties of molecular communications in IoBNT,
extending the coverage range is of importance. To address
this issue, Wang et al. proposed to deploy an
intermediate nanomachine to relay, amplify, and then forward
the received signals between the transmitter and receiver.
Various performance metrics such as mean square error, minimum error probability, and maximum probability detection
are derived, and more interestingly the performance gain can
reach 35 dB when the number of released molecules is 500.
For the architecture designs of transmitters and receivers in
IoBNT molecular communications, the interested readers are
invited to read the review article .
Summary: The potential of integrating wireless and IoT
technologies into BANs and IoBNT systems have been well
demonstrated via various existing works. Since this topic has
not been fully explored and more promising technologies will
VOLUME 2, 2021
be developed, more studies should be conducted to further
improve the performance of personalized BANs and leverage
the advantages of new technologies.
K. INTELLIGENT HEALTHCARE
1) INTRODUCTION TO THE APPLICATION
Similar to the industrial evolution from Industry 1.0 to
Industry 5.0, there have been various evolutions in the
healthcare development, which is now Healthcare 5.0 with
the emergence of digital wellness. AI-driven intelligent
healthcare will be developed based on various new methodologies including Quality of Life (QoL), Intelligent Wearable
Devices (IWD), IIoMT, H2H services, and new business
model , . Thanks to recent advances in wearable
sensors and computing devices, it is possible to monitor and
measure the health data in real-time. The sensing data collected from wearable devices can be pre-proceeded by the
nearby edge node and then sent to the doctors for remote
diagnosis. Also, with the realization of holographic communications, tactile Internet, and intelligent robots in 6G,
the doctor can remotely do the surgery. Such a tele-surgery
would remove the need of on-site operations and avoid
the risks caused by virus spreading, especially when we
are living with coronavirus-19 as well as with many other
transmissible diseases.
2) RELATED WORK
Many studies have considered 6G as a key enabler of intelligent healthcare (i.e., Healthcare 5.0). In particular, promising
technologies such as edge intelligence (i.e., cloud/edge computing + AI), holographic communications, tactile Internet,
and IoBNT are expected to play a key role. For example, since mission-critical healthcare applications would have
different QoS requirements (e.g., latency and computing
resources), Ge et al. investigated an approach, namely
ACTION, by jointly employed tactile Internet and network
function virtualization techniques. Considering that passive
optical network has the potential to support bandwidthhungry healthcare applications, the work in developed
a joint dynamic wavelength and bandwidth allocation framework. The experimental results show that the proposed
framework can provide better performance than the benchmarks in terms of packet loss and delay.
As the healthcare data is huge in volume an increase
significantly, exploiting AI (e.g., deep learning) to develop
data-driven healthcare solutions has become one important trend in healthcare research and development .
Meanwhile, since most patients do not want to share their
personal health data, if not mandatorily requested by the
governments and medical staffs, effectively overcoming the
security and privacy challenges of healthcare data usage is of
importance. Among many solutions, FL and blockchain are
promising. In particular, in FL-based healthcare solutions,
the users need not share their raw data, instead they just
need to share information of the local model . With its
decentralization and security nature, blockchain is a promising technique to provide security and privacy for transferring
and acquiring of healthcare data .
Summary: Traditional healthcare systems have various
challenges such as healthcare data are not exploited effectively and ambulance services are unsatisfactory in many
scenarios. 6G has great potential to provide intelligent
healthcare services, such as telesurgery services, precision
medicine, and IIoMT.
IV. 6G REQUIREMENTS/VISION
This section embraces the several requirements, which are
adopted from various studies , – . This section
also discusses how the 6G requirements can be improved
as compared to the existing networks. Each requirement is
then followed by several enabling applications and their key
enabling technologies.
A. FURTHER ENHANCED MOBILE BROADBAND
eMBB represents a continuing evolution from traditional
LTE, which enables mobile broadband in limited applications. The speed of eMBB is the gigabits in 4G. In 5G,
eMBB is being enhanced greatly . In addition, it has
been predicted that a series of exciting immersive applications including 3D extended reality features, 3D multimedia,
IoE will be enabled by high quality of services that would
need the peak of tens of Gbps . Therefore, 6G mobile
broadband speed has to be further improved beyond the limits of 5G, and to provide the peak of mobile broadband data
rate at Tbps level. Moreover, as the end users will be using
more high-definition contents, their mobile data rates should
also be improved up to Gbps level.
1) ENABLING 6G APPLICATIONS
It will enable many use-cases, for instance: (i) Super-Fast Hot
spot – FeMBB can dramatically enhance broadband in highly
dense or populated regions including public transportation
(e.g., high-speed trains and smart cities); (ii) Enhanced
multimedia: FeMBB would enable many of exciting ultrahigh definition media applications (e.g., 4D video gaming
and mobile TV ). Other areas of eMBB growth in
the technical work include autonomous manufacturing and
growth of connected wearables and sensors. As a result, 6G
will enable broadband everywhere on the planet.
2) ENABLING 6G TECHNOLOGIES
6G will be deployed across large number of areas through the
fixed wireless access, which will leverage 6G technologies to
deliver wireless broadband to everywhere on the planet .
Another popular technology is THz band, which is one of
the main frontiers in beyond 5G communications as of today.
The THz band would offer virtually unbounded capacity for
supporting wide-channels and extremely high data rates .
In addition, the work in deliberately supported that the
THz communications can attain high data rates through VLC.
VOLUME 2, 2021
ALWIS et al.: SURVEY ON 6G FRONTIERS: TRENDS, APPLICATIONS, REQUIREMENTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND FUTURE RESEARCH
Recently, AI/ML has been proposed to use at the physical
and MAC layers . ML can optimize synchronization, manage power allocation, and modulation and coding
schemes. Furthermore, ML would assist with efficient
spectrum sharing, channel estimation and enable adaptive
and real-time massive Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output
(MIMO) beamforming. However, such AI/ML based solutions are still under research. Therefore, it becomes viable
that we would need more intelligent algorithms that can
determine in which domains two systems can share the
spectrum with high coexistence efficiency .
B. ULTRA-MASSIVE MACHINE-TYPE COMMUNICATION
In the IoE revolution, 5G communications are expected to
support massive machine type communication for billions
of devices.
The ability to connect and transfer data up to
1 million sensors per km2. In addition, the work in 
suggested that the scale of machine type communications
will turn upside down by IoT devices and their connectivity
in IoE world. In the IoE architecture surprisingly, a trillion
of sensors and actuators will be automated to send their data
back and forth. In such massive scale networks, the current
machine type communication architecture would not be able
to cater the effective and efficient connectivity. However,
beyond 5G and/or 6G network potentially require umMTC
architecture that can support reliable connectivity to massive scale of networks, e.g., trillion of devices . Thus,
connection density will be further improved in 6G due the
popularity of novel concept of IoE.
1) ENABLING 6G APPLICATIONS
In 6G, umMTC will enable several key applications include
Internet of Industrial smart Things (IIosT), smart buildings, Internet enabled supply-chain, logistics and fleet
management, as well as air and water quality monitoring , .
In addition, other applications will
be ultra-dense cellular IoT networks, container tracking,
nature/wildlife sensing, mines/road and/or forest works
monitoring .
2) ENABLING 6G TECHNOLOGIES
Technologies, such as SigFoX and LoRa , will be the
potential candidates for network connectivity and coverage
towards the 6G network. In another vein, MTC architecture
and its features can also be realized in 6G using a licensed
spectrum that would overlay on existing communication
infrastructure (e.g., RAN). In addition, such architecture
can provide guaranteed more reliability to the devices in
the 6G communications. In order to achieve this mainly
two technologies can be utilized as enabling technologies:
(i) enhanced MTC and, (ii) Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT),
among others . The eMTC can provide high bandwidth
data rate (e.g., up to 1 Mbps) and can support high mobility to many of 6G enabled applications such as Internet
of Vehicles (IoV) . Whereas the NB-IoT can enable

and/or support many applications which required low data
bandwidth (e.g., in the order of Kbps) .
In another vein, Massive MIMO is one of the substantial candidates that can enhance efficiency of spectrum in
multi-user environment . As a result, it can enhance the
channel capacity in 5G and beyond networks. In order to simulate massive MIMO, the authors in , applied MIMO
to solve the issues of perfect channel allocation (PCA)
issue. The authors used bit-error rate for PCA. Moreover,
they utilized a narrowband (shared) communication to collect network data traffic from MTC devices (i.e., connected
devices in the network). To enhance the broadband efficiency,
they used clustering technique where heterogeneous devices
share own cluster’s resources .

reliability
99.999% . However, by 2030, innovations would need
extremely super high ultra-reliability not only in MTC but
in several other communications as well, such as deviceto-device communication, WiFi, device-to-cloud, and so on.
In a practical scenarios, consider a medical surgeon is sitting in front of a telecommunications-based smart surface or
console in Chicago city, while the patient lies on an operation bed 4000 miles away in Dublin, Ireland, as shown in
Fig. 7. Using the smart surface and other communication
technologies, the medical surgeon can remotely control the
movement of a multi-armed surgical robot to remove the
70-year old patient’s diseased gallbladder. However, such
time-critical robotic surgery application will demand ultra
high reliability and low-latency communication. Therefore,
in 6G, the researchers must explore and develop new or
enhance techniques that can enable eRLLC to provide the
high reliability rate (99.99999%) than the 5G.
1) ENABLING 6G APPLICATIONS
Low-Latency
Communication (eURLLC) will enable several applications such as telemedicine, XR, Internet of Healthcare
(IoH) revolution includes HT, and AI-Healthcare. All of
these applications demands superior-ultra-reliable communication .
VOLUME 2, 2021
2) KEY ENABLING 6G TECHNOLOGIES
Designing of eRLLC systems (i.e., high reliability and low
latency), demand various parameters, such as end-to-end
fast turnaround time, intelligent framing and coding, efficient resource management, intelligent up-link and down-link
communication and so on. For more details please refer
to . Alsenwi et al. discussed another enabling
technology that would be useful in uplink grant-free structures and in reducing the transmission latency. In , the
authors proposed to not use of a middle-man cognitive operation that would typically require a committed scheduling
grant technique.
D. EXTREMELY LOW-POWER COMMUNICATION
Internet-enabled resource-constrained objects are increasing
rapidly and these objects required highly efficient hardware that can be self-powered. However, research revealed
that the traditional devices are integrated with large-scale
antenna arrays (e.g., MIMO) that will inevitably bring high
power consumption . In 5G network, several technologies are available to facilitate low power communication
with 5G communication networks. For instance, back-scatter
communication, hybrid analog/digital hybrid precoding, lensbased beam domain transmission technology, sparse array
and sparse RF link designing. Nevertheless, such approaches
may not be fully being able to control the environmental
issues such as the nature of the wireless communication and
that may consume more power . Therefore, 6G communication must focus on maintaining high-speed transmission
while reducing energy consumption.
1) ENABLING 6G APPLICATIONS
Several applications will require extremely low power communications, however, currently the promising applications
are smart homes, smart cars, UAV, etc.
2) ENABLING 6G TECHNOLOGIES
In order to achieve Extremely Low-Power Communication
(ELPC), the researchers propose to deploy the Intelligent
Reflecting Surface (IRS), which is known as Reconfigurable
Intelligent Surface (RIS) . With the use of few antennas,
the IRS may help to reduce the dependencies of hardware
complexities in transmitter and receiver. In addition, utilizing
passive artificial arrays to greatly reduce energy consumption. In another vein, the IRS technology is being quite
attractive from an energy consumption point of view. In
IRS, no power amplifier is being used to amplify and forward the incoming signal. As a result, since no amplifier is
used, an IRS will consume much less energy than a regular
amplify-and-forward relay transceiver .

requirements in 6G . In 5G, LDHMC services are
undeniable as they can support up to 500 km/h. Consider
a science-fiction example, a high-speed rail will operate
over 500 km/h in the next few decade and that will require
long distance and high mobility to support communications
and services for on-board crew and passengers. Therefore,
5G-based LDHMC may not be enough for the future applications, as they may require long distance communication
for many thousands of km and may require seamless mobility. In addition, the research reveals that the node mobility is
highly challenging in different environments (such as deep
water) . Therefore, 6G must require long distance and
high mobility communication (e.g., >1,000 km/h) based
seamless services for future applications.
1) ENABLING 6G APPLICATIONS
Following the , 6G will enable many exciting applications, few of the examples are as space sightseeing, deep-sea
tourism, high-speed transportation, as shown in Fig. 8.
2) ENABLING 6G TECHNOLOGIES
There are several enabling technologies such as accurate
channel estimation. Due to severe time and frequency spreading in high mobility wireless communications, channel
estimation is very challenging. Filter based alternative waveforms (alternatives to orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing), such as filter-bank multicarrier and universal
filtered multicarrier are good candidates for 6G high mobility
communications.
F. HIGH SPECTRUM EFFICIENCY
As projected in , , a high magnitude of devices
or smart objects is anticipated to grow many times in 6G
network. Specifically in the region of thousand(s) of smart
devices including machines, equipment’s, sensors, and many
more, in a given cubic meter . Nevertheless, ultra high
definition video streams such as holographic contents need
will required high bandwidth spectrum that may not be supported by the spectrum of the millimeter-wave. This will
pose an unmanageable disturbance related to the area efficiency where high number of devices may not be able

to connect appropriately to the current network. This will
lead to deploy the new technology in the 6G domain such
as sub-THz and THz bands, that can bridge the meet the
requirements of for the high spectrum efficiency network
based applications .
1) ENABLING 6G APPLICATIONS
6G network will enable data-hungry applications, such as
augmented reality/mixed reality. This is going to enable new
smart services in smart cities, smart agriculture, retail, supply
chain and much more to function seamlessly.
2) KEY ENABLING 6G TECHNOLOGIES
In , two open loop beamforming methods with the
help of location information (i.e., the location based MIMO
precoding and the location assisted MIMO precoder cycling)
are being proposed. These techniques can be attributed the
early enabling technologies for high spectrum efficiency.
G. HIGH AREA TRAFFIC CAPACITY
Area traffic capacity corresponds to the total traffic throughput served per geographic area (bit/s/m2) . In this
regard, it is widly anticipated that 5G may enable a traffic
capacity of 10 Mbps per square metre in dedicated hotspot
areas. However, the applications such as 3/4-D multimedia
would require high traffic capacity and that may be not supported by current 5G communications. Therefore, 6G must
provide ten times the area traffic capacity of 5G, as suggested in . More importantly, this will reach up to 1
Gb/s/m2 for the real-world applications .

2) ENABLING 6G TECHNOLOGIES
To attain high traffic capacity in automated vehicles, the work
in proposed a novel technique. The authors assumed
that each smart vehicle comprises of two distinct modules,
a leader and a follower. However, the proposed technique
ensures a high traffic capacity and vehicle density in a dense
geographical location. In addition, the authors claimed that
their proposal can avoid the traffic congestion significantly.

H. MOBILE BROADBAND AND LOW-LATENCY (MBBLL)
MBBLL will be the enabling necessity in 6G communications. In order to understand the concept of MBBLL,
consider an example of a VR application . In VR environments, requiring high latency is the utmost demand for
a pleasant experience of an immersive VR headset to its
users . The human eye typically requires free and perfect smooth movement, i.e., low Motion-To-Photon (MTP)
response time without any interruption. Here, the MTP is the
time within a moment and the pixels of a picture frame that
represents to the new field of view (FoV) which has shown
to the human eye . However, a high MTP response
time may directs contradictory signal values to the vestibuloocular reflex (VoR), i.e., between the head movement and
eye. In addition, a high MTP response time might lead
to an apparent motion illness. More precisely, practically,
in the simple setting, the value for MTP’s upper bound is
< 15 −20 ms. At the same time, the loop back response
time of 4/5G is 25 ms in the given ideal functioning conditions. However, such VR-based applications require high data
bandwidth rates (e.g., downlink peak data rate > 1 Tbps, and
user experienced data rate > 10 Gbps) including ultra high
definition pictures, videos and other immersive instructions
such as human gestures. Moreover, it demands low response
time for real-time voice-based commands (< 0.1 ms) and
prompt control receptions (< 1 ms). In addition, these
requirements must also be assured in high-mobility use-cases
(> 1000 km/h), for example space tourism, deep-sea tourism,
high-speed transportation, and so on.
1) ENABLING 6G APPLICATIONS
Typical MBBLL applications include mobile AR, VR, and
2) ENABLING 6G TECHNOLOGIES
The work in introduced a proposal where multi-edge
computing is being used to attain an end-to-end guaranteed
low latency for VR video streaming using the immersive
technologies. The authors designed a low-complexity mechanism that can offload the high computations tasks to MEC,
and can achieve energy efficiency. Such proposal can be
attributed as the enabling techniques for 6G communications.
I. MASSIVE LOW-LATENCY MACHINE TYPE
COMMUNICATIONS (MLLMT)
The purpose of MTC in the 6G automation is associated with
the many services, such as data availability, ultra scalability,
and more importantly low latency in the 6G enabled applications. Such low latency services are highly paramount for
time critical applications where decision making will happen on a scale of fraction of milliseconds. However, such
requirements (e.g., low latency, high availability, etc.) may
not be met by the existing wireless network including 4/5G
network due to several challenges, such as confined resources
of communication technologies, lack of automation of operations, human-centric devices, and so on. Hence, 6G has
to increase its mission-critical mLLMT communication to
support future applications.
1) ENABLING 6G APPLICATIONS
Multiple application domains include such as home and
automation,

distributed
resources with the energy plants, unmanned vehicle systems,
IoT-enabled healthcare infrastructures, and controlling and

monitoring industrial 4.0 use-cases. To boost such innovative and immersive IoE applications and many others (e.g.,
space tourism), there is a pressing demand for new wireless
technologies that can enable and support a massive number
of connections among IoE devices and ground to space and
vice-versa.
2) ENABLING 6G TECHNOLOGIES
There are several existing technologies that can directly be
adopted to enable the mLLMT services in 6G ecosystem. For
instance, Park and Saad , proposed a mechanism that
may enable low latency machine type communication where
the resources of IoE devices can be shared within a fraction
of response time (in milliseconds). The authors designed a
novel finite memory multi-state sequential learning framework that will suitably fulfill the requirements in several
scenarios, such as delay-tolerant applications, periodic messages delivery, and urgent and critical messages exchanges.
Park et al.’s claimed that their suggested learning framework
will enhance the latency of IoE devices or MTC to learn the
several number of critical messages, and to redistribute the
network and communication resources for the delivery of
periodic messages that to be used for the critical messages
in many of 6G applications.
J. AI-ASSISTIVE EXTREME COMMUNICATIONS
In next the two-three decades, AI will immerse in every
aspect of communication and will be heavily used for communication purposes. Here, we propose a term AI-assistive
extreme communications (AEC). However, as of today, 4/5G
network would not be able to deal with such massive scale
of devices, applications, heterogeneous standard and nonstandard practices, different stakeholders, etc. Therefore, 6G
must require such AEC.
1) ENABLING 6G APPLICATIONS
The AEC network may control and monitor trillions of
devices in various verticals (e.g., IoT manufacturing and
supply chain) across the globe. These devices keep track
of several intelligent parameters – bandwidth allocation,
decision making in data routing and aggregation, knowledge sharing, are few examples. Other application opportunities are AI-empowered data-driven network planning,
operation, intelligent mobility, handover management, and
smart spectrum management to achieve many of realworld traditional environments to dynamic communication
environments in 6G.

and creatively redefining the communication symbols. A support vector machine based nonlinear equalization mechanism
can be used in the wireless network and communication
of 6G, where the temporal correlation exists in the collected inter symbol interference data. For the more details,
interested readers may refer to .
In summary, to realize new applications, 6G networks
have to provide extended network capabilities beyond 5G
networks. Fig. 9 illustrates such requirements which need to
be satisfy by 6G networks to enable future applications.
Finally, Table 4 summarises various requirements in 6G
applications.
V. 6G ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES
This section expounds numerous technologies which are
deemed to be the key enablers for future 6G communication
systems. The way this section is organized is as follows. For
every technology, we start with a brief discussion on the basic
concepts of the technology following with its importance in
the 6G realm, and finally summarize the latest related works.
A. BEYOND SUB 6 GHZ TOWARDS THZ
COMMUNICATION
The rapid increase in wireless data traffic is estimated to
have seven fold increase in mobile data traffic from 2016 to
2021 . Wide radio bands such as the millimeter-waves
(up to 300 GHz) are expected to fulfill the demand for data
in 5G networks. However, applications such as HT, BCI
and XR are expected to require data rates in the range of
Tbps which would be difficult with mmWave systems .
This requires exploring the Terahertz (THz) frequency band
(0.1-10 THz). This type of communication will especially
be useful for ultra high data rate communication with zero
error rates within short distances.
VOLUME 2, 2021
ALWIS et al.: SURVEY ON 6G FRONTIERS: TRENDS, APPLICATIONS, REQUIREMENTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND FUTURE RESEARCH
TABLE 4. Requirements of different 6G applications.
1) IMPORTANCE TO 6G
6G is expected to deliver over 1000x increase in the data
rates compared to 5G in order to meet the target requirement
of 1 Tbps. More spectrum resources beyond sub 6 GHz are
explored by researchers to cater to this significant increase in
data rates. Early 6G systems are expected to bank on sub 6
GHz mmWave wireless networks. However, 6G is expected
to progress by exploiting frequencies beyond mmWave, at
the THz band . The size of 6G cells are expected to
shrink further from small cells in 5G towards tiny cells
that will have a radius of only few tens meters. Thus, 6G
networks will require to have a new architectural design
and mobility management techniques that can meet denser
network deployments than 5G . 6G transceivers will also
be required to support integrated frequency bands ranging
from microwave to THz spectra.
2) RELATED WORK
frequency bands. This allows the usage of electronics-based
and photonics-based technologies in future communication
networks. As for electronic devices, nano-fabrication technologies can facilitate the progress of semiconductor devices
that operates in the THz frequency band. The electronics
in these devices are made from Gallium Arsenide, Indium
Phosphide and various Silicon-based technologies ,
 . Authors in present a scalable Silicon architecture that allows synthesis and shaping of THz wave
signals in a single microchip. The feeding mechanism
of optical fibers to THz circuits is prominent to achieve
higher data rates in terms of photonics-devices. Conventional
materials used at lower frequencies in the microwave and
mmWave ranges are not enough efficient for high frequency
wireless communication. Devices made from such materials exhibit large losses at the THz frequency range. THz
waves require electromagnetically reconfigurable materials.
In this context, Graphene is identified as a suitable candidate to reform THz electromagnetic waves by using thin
graphene layers , . Graphene based THz wireless communication components have exhibited promising
results in terms of generating, modulating and detecting
THz waves . THz wireless communication allows small
antenna sizes to achieve both diversity gain and antenna
directivity gain using MIMO. Authors in introduced
1024x1024 ultra-Massive MIMO as an approach to increase
the communication distance in THz wireless communication
THz band channel is considered highly frequency selective . These channels suffer from high atmospheric
absorption, atmospheric attenuation, and free-space path loss.
This requires the development of new channel models to
mimic the behavior of THz communication channels .
Reference proposed the first statistical model for
THz channels. This model depends on performing extensive ray-tracing simulations to obtain statistical parameters
of the channel. Recent studies in – provides
more accurate channel models. Various research works have
also focused on applications of THz communication. A
hybrid radio frequency and free space optical system is
presented in , where a THz/optical link is envisaged
VOLUME 2, 2021
as a suitable method for future wireless communication. In
addition, presents using THz links in data centers to
improve performance while achieving a massive savings in
minimizing the cable usage.
Summary: THz communications are expected to pave the
way for Tbps data rate to meet the demands of future applications and has potential to strengthen backhaul networks.
Nevertheless, it suffers from high propagation losses and
demands LoS for communications. More efforts are required
to understand the behavior of THz signals and better channel
models are required.
B. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND FEDERATED
Thanks to distinctive features and remarkable abilities, AI
has found various applications in wireless and mobile
networking. Massive data generated by massive IoT devices
can be exploited by AI approaches to extract valuable
information, and thus improving the network operation and
performance. Recently, FL has emerged as a new AI concept
that leverages on-device processing power and improves the
user data privacy – . The rationale is to collaboratively train a shared model such that participating devices
train the local models and only share the updates (instead
of data) with the centralized parameter server , .
According to , FL can be classified into horizontal FL,
vertical FL, and federated transfer learning.
1) IMPORTANCE TO 6G
With 6G being envisioned to have AI/ML at its core, the
role of AI/FL becomes important to 6G. The use of conventional centralized ML approaches is suitable for network
scenarios, where centralized data collection and processing
are available. As the amount of mobile data and advancements in computing hardware and learning advancements,
numerous problems in future 6G networks can be effectively by AI approaches such as modulation classification,
waveform detection, signal processing, and physical layer
design , , . To overcome limitations of centralized AI such as privacy concern and huge communication
overhead , FL is gaining popularity and is emerging as
viable distributed AI solution that enables ‘ubiquitous AI’
vision of 6G communications . FL offers multitude
of benefits to 6G, as summarized by authors in , are
communication-efficient distributed AI, support for heterogeneous data originating from different devices pertaining
to different services that can lead to non-identically distributed (non-IID) dataset, privacy-protection since data
remains locally and is not uploaded anywhere, and enabling
large-scale deployment.
2) RELATED WORK
The last few years has witnessed the use of different AI
techniques for numerous problems in wireless networks. For
example, Luong et al. reviewed applications of Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for three important topics,
including network access and rate control, data caching and
computation offloading, security and connectivity preservation, and for a number of miscellaneous issues such as
resource allocation, traffic routing, signal detection, and load
balancing. The applications of ML for wireless networks was
reviewed in , where AI-enabled resource management,
networking, mobility, localization solutions are discussed.
The use of transfer learning, deep learning, and swarm intelligence for future wireless networks can be in – .
Some of related work pertaining to use of FL in wireless networks. Khan et al. propose a Stackelberg
game-based approach to incentivize the interaction between
global server and devices participating in training model.
Xiao et al. proposed a FL framework for IoT networks
with the aim to simultaneously maximize the utilization efficiency of edge resources and minimize the cost for IoT
networks. Kang et al. proposed an incentive FL mechanism using contract theory to allows highly-reputed devices
to engage in the training task. Some challenges of FL are
highlighted in , , including cost of communications, significant hardware heterogeneity, high device churn,
privacy leakage through model update, and security issues.
Summary: AI and FL techniques enable the design of
intelligent mechanisms for future 6G networks via exploiting
massive mobile data and increasingly computing resources
available at the network edge. Nevertheless, in order to effectively realize AI, the very first challenge is the existence
of high-quality training datasets. Another challenge is the
inclusion of AI in beyond 5G and future 6G networks .
Moreover, the bottlenecks of AI caused by 6G wireless
networks with many new advanced technologies, device heterogeneity, and emerging intelligent applications, should be
further studied. Regarding FL, the devices need to be incentivized to participate in training process and also, the rouge
devices need to be detected as early as possible. Moreover,
the challenges like privacy leakage via model updates and
hardware heterogeneity also need to be met .
C. COMPRESSIVE SENSING
Sampling is an integral part of modern digital signal processing and stands at the interface between analog (physical) and
digital world. Traditionally, for efficient transmission, flexible processing, noise immunity, security inclusion (using
encryption and decryption), low cost, etc., Nyquist sampling
theorem has been used. According to this, for a bandlimited
signal, if the samples are taken at a rate greater than equal
to twice the highest frequency of that signal then the exact
replica of the signal can be reconstructed using these samples. Sampling is usually followed by compression process
where the sampled data is compressed to maintain some
acceptable level of quality . As pointed out in ,
with the increase in the transmission bandwidth with 5G and
future 6G mobile networks, the continued used of Nyquist
sampling technique will result in numerous challenges like
significant overheads, large complexity and higher power
consumption. In this context, CS has been proposed as an
VOLUME 2, 2021
ALWIS et al.: SURVEY ON 6G FRONTIERS: TRENDS, APPLICATIONS, REQUIREMENTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND FUTURE RESEARCH
intriguing solution that has potential to overcome the limits imposed by traditional sampling. CS, which is at times
also referred as compressive sampling or sparse sampling, is
basically a sub-Nyquist sampling framework that states that
provided a signal is characterized by sparsity and incoherence, it can be sampled at a rate smaller than the Nyquist
rate and the resulting (smaller set of) samples are sufficient
to reconstruct the original signal . This is achieved in
computationally efficient manner and by finding solution to
underdetermined linear system. Moreover, in CS both the
sampling and compression is carried out at the same time.
1) IMPORTANCE TO 6G
In nutshell, sampling rate in CS depends on sparsity and
incoherence characteristic of the signal being sampled, and
does not depends on the bandwidth of the signal . This
property of CS opens the door for it applicability to 6G
networks. In general, CS is proposed to be used for reducing
the data generated by IoT devices for mMTC . Another
proposed use of CS is to enable NOMA at the transmitter in
the landscape of mMTC scenario . This is carried out
by assigning non-orthogonal spreading codes to devices and
applying CS based MultiUser Detection (CS-MUD) technique since very less percentage of total devices are active
at any given time. The advantage is this scheme incur no
control signaling overhead. Yet another use of CS along with
deep learning techniques is to overcome the issues pertaining
to the expected intensive usage of Large Intelligent Surfaces
(LISs) in the next generation networks .
2) RELATED WORK
Gao et al. surveyed various CS techniques that
are useful for next-generation of wireless communications.
Authors explained different CS models, and in particular discussed how CS can play an instrumental role for the three
different technical domains vis higher spectral efficiency,
larger transmission bandwidth and efficient spectrum reuse.
Liang et al. proposed to solve the problem of BS getting overwhelmed by the estimates of downlink CSI. These
estimates are necessary for efficient working of FDD-MIMO
systems and are computed at UEs to send to BS. Thus, the
authors propose CS-ReNet framework where the estimates
at UEs are compressed using CS and then uncompressed at
the BS using deep learning based CS reconstruction mechanism. Another interesting work focuses on how to
validate the sparsity assumption that underlies the application of CS techniques. In this direction, authors present an
algorithm that utilizes learned dictionary and ML prediction
for inferring level of sparsity. Further, the authors report that
the proposed algorithm is able to make quality estimates for
sparsity levels in wireless channels and in cognitive radio
spectra. Yet another work by Li et al. applies CS
for encryption of high resolution images that will proliferate in 6G era. The idea there is to compress and encrypt
the images simultaneously. Furthermore, a method to use
multiple estimates of signals with existing sparsifying bases
to reconstruct signals from compressive measurements to
improve reconstruction performance is given in . This
method reduces the decoding complexity as it does not bank
on heavy learning techniques for dictionary creation.
Summary: CS is expected to be an important enabling
technology for 6G since it is way to reduce the data that need
to be exchanged for required communication. The signal with
sparsity and incoherence characteristics can be reconstructed
with lesser number of samples in CS than required as per
Nyquist sampling theorem. However, to gain the maximum
benefit, it is important to ensure that signals have the required
level sparsity.
Thus, efficient techniques are required to ensure the sparsity assumption. If used with proper estimation, CS has
potential to support other technologies like LIS, MIMO and
D. BLOCKCHAIN/DLT
The last couple of years have witnessed the rise of DLT, in
particular, the Blockchain technology. DLT is envisioned to
unlock the doors to the decentralized future by overcoming
the well-known impediments of centralized systems .
Blockchain is a type DLT which maintains a digital ledger
in a secure and distributed way. This ledger holds all the
transactions in a chronological order and is cryptographically
sealed . Blockchain technology has received all-around
attention equally by industry as well as by academia
since it offers numerous advantages like disintermediation,
immutability, non-repudiation, proof of provenance, integrity,
and pseudonymity .
1) IMPORTANCE TO 6G
Many sectors have already acknowledged the pragmatic
use of blockchain technology and its efficacy as they
are running/offering blockchain-based technological solutions . Examples of some of these business sectors
are finance and banking, industrial supply chain and manufacturing, shipping and transportation, medical health care
and patient records, and educational processes and credentialing. The world of mobile communications is not an
exception to this list , . Blockchain can play a
cardinal role in improving (i) management and orchestration
in terms of interference, resource, spectrum and mobility
management – , (ii) operations in terms of cellfree communication and 3D-networking, and (iii) business
models in terms of decentralized and trustless digital markets
involving various stakeholders like Infrastructure Providers
(InPs), network tenants, industry verticals, Over-The-Top
(OTT) providers, and edge providers , . Further,
blockchain has an immense potential to strengthen the existing service arena of mobile networks as well as set the floor
for futuristic applications and use case of 6G.
2) RELATED WORK
Blockchain has been identified as one of the key enabling
technologies for 6G. Numerous efforts are being made to
VOLUME 2, 2021
leverage its potential to improve both the technical aspects
of 6G as well as use cases of 6G ecosystem. For instance,
author in , have presented the use of blockchain for
decentralized network management of 6G. In particular, the
work showed the blockchain plus smart contract for spectrum
trading. In , authors proposed blockchain-based Radio
Access Network (B-RAN) that allows small sub-networks to
collaborate in trustless environment in order to create larger
cooperative network. Authors in have presented how
blockchain can be leveraged to remove intermediate layer
(i.e., disintermediate) and develop a distributed Mobility-asa-Service that is hosted as an application on edge computing
facility. Improved transparency and trust among all the
stakeholders are the manifested advantages of this work.
Li et al. advocated the use of blockchain for ensuring
data security AI powered applications for 6G. Two applications focused by authors were indoor positioning and
autonomous vehicles.
Summary: Blockchain being one of the prominent type of
DLT has turn out to be very promising key enabling technology because of its builtin strong security nature. On the
one hand, it can enhance the technical aspects of 6G like
dynamic spectrum sharing, resource management, mobility
management, and on the other hand it enables unforeseen
applications like HT, XR, fully CAVs, Industry 5.0 and
many more. Nevertheless, in order to harness best use of
blockchain for 6G challenges like computational overheads,
lightweight consensus algorithms, high transaction throughput, quantum resistance and storage scalability need to be
mitigated.
E. SWARM UAVS
Numerous natural phenomena such as the how bees coordinate with each other to accomplish a critical task and flocks
of geese coordinate to find efficient flight paths to achieve
their migration, have inspired many fields of research. In
general, swarm is a group that coordinates with each other
to achieve specific goals and objectives , . Recent
developments in the area of UAVs has drawn significant
attention towards UAV swarm networks for communication,
surveillance, medical-care, disaster management, etc. UAV
swarms use wireless communication to interact and share
information among UAVs, where each UAV acts as a node
in a multi-hop communication network. UAV swarms consist of heterogeneous UAVs that govern themselves while
moving in a coordinated way . UAV swarms are capable of overcoming any limitations of UAVs operating as
individual node that needs to be controlled continuously,
that has a limited payload, a limited flight time, and a
limited communication range . UAV swarm network
model includes three scenarios. They are (i) swarm topology
model using scale free networks, (ii) swarm damage model to
minimize the damage at each threat event, and (iii) swarm
recovery model to configure network nodes to ensure the
connectivity .
1) IMPORTANCE TO 6G
6G is expected to incorporate swarms of UAVs, robots,
and edge devices due to their collaborative nature .
Swarm UAVs are envisaged to be an integral component of
6G , , . Aerial Base Stations (ABS) deployed
using UAV swarm can provide on-demand broadband, and
seamless connectivity in a reliable, cost-effective and agile
fashion . The dawn of 6G will raise the demand for connecting massive number of IoE devices which may be located
outside the coverage area of terrestrial cellular networks
and may be difficult to be connected using conventional
IoT technologies such as NB-IoT and Long Range Radio
(LoRa). Moreover, providing connectivity using satellites is
also challenging due to the inherent latency and limited data
rate. Thus, swarm UAVs are expected to be utilized to connect wide-area IoT networks in 6G . UAV swarms are
also expected to be widely deployed to facilitate cell-free
communication and massive MIMO systems .
2) RELATED WORK
Increasing popularity of UAVs is due to their easy deployability, configurability, and comparatively low implementation
cost. Authors in present a blockchain-based softwarized multi-swarming UAV communication scheme for
a 6G networks. This scheme combines THz spectrum
together with intelligent connectivity and virtualization of
communication links. A flexible and easily configurable
communication infrastructure is achieved through softwarization while data security is ensured by the use of blockchain.
Liu et al. investigated a wide-area IoT-oriented cell-free
cognitive satellite-UAV network to address possible issues in
implementing a hybrid satellite UAV network. This work also
addresses opportunistic spectrum sharing for satellite-UAV
networks. UAV swarms can employ FL models to execute
various tasks such as monitoring, target recognition, and
power allocation and scheduling . Bai et al. propose a model and a resilience metric that can be used to
evaluate the resilience of a UAV swarm. This model and the
metric can be used for mission planning and designing of
a UAV swarm. Gao et al. consider the uplink transmission between a MIMO ground station and UAV swarm
to study the positioning of UAVs in the 3D space such
that the channel capacity of the MIMO system is maximized using decentralized UAVs channel capacity learning.
Attacks performed by malicious UAVs, which attempt to
enter into UAV swarm networks can be mitigated using
blockchain to protect networks against either intruders or
spoofing attempts . Swarm robotics is another area
of swarm networks, as reviewed in . Swarm robots
may also contribute toward establishing swarm networks
in situations where UAVs cannot be deployed, such as in
underground and underwater communication.
Summary: Swarm UAV represents fleet of UAVs that
coordinate with each other to accomplish a common goal.
Their role as flying or aerial BS will enable to extend
the coverage radio coverage in remote areas as well as
VOLUME 2, 2021

areas which less population. Swarm UAVs can be integrated
with terrestrial networks and satellite networks to realize
3D networking with cell-free communications. Nevertheless,
there are numerous challenges like interoperability, energizing, physical security and channel sensing in drastic
environments.
F. ZERO TOUCH NETWORK AND SERVICE
MANAGEMENT
Zero touch network and Service Management (ZSM) is an
evolving concept that aims to provide a framework for building a fully automated network management, primarily driven
by the initiative of ETSI. The idea of ZSM is to empower the
network so that they can perform self-configuration to carry
out autonomous configuration without the need of explicit
human intervention, self-optimization to better adapt as per
the prevailing situation, self-healing to ensure correct functioning, self-monitoring to track its own functioning, and
self-scaling to dynamically engage or disengage resources
as per need . To stress the importance of ZSM framework, ETSI in has identified list of scenarios that
are grouped into seven different broad categories which
are as follows: (i) End-to-end network and service management category talks about the automation of operational
and functional tasks involved in end-to-end lifecyle management of different types of network resources and services
that are part of core network, transport network and radio
access network; (ii) Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) presents
the requirement of exposing some of the service capabilities from all the parts of the network to enable zero-touch
automation; (iii) Analytics and ML scenario emphasize the
need of integration of ML and AI capabilities for realizing ZSM; (iv) Collaborative service management category
emphasizes on the need of collaborative management spanning domains of multiple operators; (v) Security highlights
the need of strong security and privacy mechanisms for ZSM
framework; (vi) Testing scenario points out the need of automated testing of resources as well as services; (vii) Tracing
scenario needs are driven by requirement for automated troubleshooting and root cause analysis. In this direction recently
a framework named as Self Evolving Networks (SENs) 
has been proposed that aims to automate the network management with self-efficient resource utilization, coordination
and conflict management, inherent security and trust, reduce
cost, and high QoE.
1) IMPORTANCE TO 6G
Future 6G networks are going to heterogeneous networks
multi-tenancy,
multi-operator,
multi-(micro)services features. To make such networks work at their best
and at low cost, they are envisioned to be fully automated.
Thus, ZSM becomes highly important. Use of AI/ML capabilities within the framework of ZSM has indeed potential to
add many new capabilities (as mentioned above) and set the
floor for AI-enabled autonomous networks. However, security remains the high concern. This is because ML techniques
are vulnerable to attacks like poisoning attack or evasion
attack . Here, the use of blockchain as common communication channel can do the required. Further, enabling
automated service updates without affecting service interoperability as well as end-user experience is another challenge
when using ZSM .
2) RELATED WORK
In light of the use of AI/ML solutions proposed by
ETSI , the work highlights the limitations and
potential risks involved when using these techniques. Authors
projected limitations broadly under two categories; (i) limited AI due to lack of labeled datasets, interoperability of
AI/ML models and significant training time required and
(ii) security issues mainly because AI/ML techniques are
prone to attacks like poisoning attack during training and
evasion attack during testing. Further, in authors discussed potential attacks on ZSM that includes attacks on
open API, treats on intent-based interfaces, vulnerabilities
of closed-loop automation, and attacks on AI/ML techniques. The work also proposed possible solutions that talks
about adding various security features by adding control
information, proper authentication and authorization controls, traffic monitoring, validation of inputs and more. In
another related work, Darwish et al. proposed the SEN
framework for future networks that utilizes the Intelligent
Vertical Heterogeneous Network (I-VHetNet ) as the
base architecture. Authors presented five different scenarios where SEN can contribute significantly to automate the
network management. In particular, for the case of distributed
data offloading and computation authors showed that SEN
outperforms SON (Self Organizing Networks which was
proposed by 3GPP for 4G and 5G) in terms of data offloading
and computation delays.
Summary: With the initiative of ETSI, ZSM is an evolving framework that aims to instill automation capabilities
in terms of configuration and optimization, monitoring and
healing, and testing and scaling. To have zero touch automation active collaboration and intelligent decision will be
required. AI/ML are the highly sought after solutions to
effectuate ZSM, nevertheless, security guarantee of AL/ML
models is the challenge. Moreover, the aspect of conflict
resolution also need to be dealt since 6G will allow the
coexistence of several stakeholders and various automated
components.
G. EFFICIENT ENERGY TRANSFER AND HARVESTING
Energy harvesting has been the much sought area of research
when it comes to future sustainable way of energizing the
growing number of connected devices. The aims of energy
harvesting is to replace the conventional ways of powering
devices and sensors by tapping the energy from ambient
environment. The two broad class of sources for energy harvesting are natural sources and man-made sources .
Natural sources include renewable energy sources like solar,
mechanical vibrations, wind, thermal, microbial fuel cell,
VOLUME 2, 2021
and human activity powered , . Man-made energy
harvesting happens through Wireless Energy Transfer (WET)
where dedicated power beacon is used to transfer energy
from source to destination , . Since the natural
sources of energy harvesting suffer unpredictability and periodicity they fail to offer guaranteed QoS, thus WET is the
hot research area .
1) IMPORTANCE TO 6G
With the vision of universal communication system and providing solid underpinning to IoE, the future 6G networks will
be proliferated with large number of connected devices. The
conventional way of powering these devices with rechargeable or replaceable batteries might not efficiently scale
in 6G era. The reason being such solutions are, in general, costly, inconvenient, risky, and have adverse effects
when the devices are operating inside the body .
Thus energy harvesting technologies are considered to be
an efficient alternative solution for next generation mobile
networks . In this context, much of the excitement
revolves around the idea that the radio signals can simultaneously transfer energy as well as information . This
at times referred as Radio Frequency Energy Harvesting
(RF-EH) . Nevertheless, to have the pragmatic use of
such techniques and to gain the maximum benefit the challenge lies in efficient integration of both wireless information
transfer and wireless energy transfer provided that their hardware and operational requirements are different . The
other open issues are high mobility, multi-user energy and
information scheduling, resource allocation and interference
management, health issues, and security issues , .
2) RELATED WORK
To improve both the spectral and the energy efficiency of
IoT devices in 6G era, authors in used the combination
of cooperative spectrum sharing and Simultaneous Wireless
Information and Power transfer (SWIPT) techniques. To
overcome the interference issue, which is a significant challenge in wireless information and energy transfer, this work
makes use of orthogonal subcarriers. Authors in propose the applicability of Extended Kalman filtering (EKF)
to forecast the power that can be harvested. The work 
reveals that Channel State Information (CSI) acquisition is
an important impediment in utilizing WET to massive IoT
scenario and thus propose CSI-free multiple-antenna strategies — One Antenna (OA), All Antennas at Once (AA),
and Switching Antenna (SA) — for WET. To access the
performance of the proposed CSI-free strategies, the authors
uses two metrics which are Average Harvested Energy per
node (AHE) and Average Energy Outage probability per
node (AEO). Their results show decreasing AEO probability
when Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) (aka Distributed
Power Beacons (DPB)) is used in conjunction with CSI-free
Summary: Using WET for both information and energy
transfer is seen as way to energize the connected devices in
future. Though, RF-EH can be consistent source of energy
than natural sources, however, the challenge would be to
have efficient and simultaneous transfer of information and
energy provided the requirements for the two are different.
H. LARGE INTELLIGENT SURFACES
The emerging paradigm for controlling the propagation environment via smart and intelligent surfaces has been referred
with numerous names like LIS, IRS, RIS, Software-Defined
Surface (SDS) and many more , . LIS can play a
vital role when direct line of sight (LoS) communication is
either not feasible or degrades in quality such that it hampers the sensible communication . LIS provides a way
to transform man-made structures (for, e.g., building, roads,
indoor walls/ceilings) to an intelligent and electromagnetically active wireless environment . This transformation
is performed by augmenting these structures either with large
array of small, low-cost and passive antenna or with metamaterial (aka metasurfaces), such that they help in controlling
the characteristics like reflection, scattering and refraction
of propagation environment , . Although, changes
can be made to different characteristics of the incident electromagnetic signals by LIS, however, as mentioned in ,
most of the work focus on change in phase of incident signal.
1) IMPORTANCE TO 6G
LIS have been identified as key technological enabler for
6G since it is going to operate at higher frequencies and
is expected to go beyond the massive MIMO , .
Various advantages of LIS over conventional massive MIMO,
as highlighted in , includes reduced noise, lower interuser interference, and reliable communication. Interestingly,
LIS would allow the use of holographic Radio Frequency
as well as holographic MIMO . Moreover, in 6G realm,
LIS can be used to better sense wireless environment by
capturing CSI .
2) RELATED WORKS
Taha et al. deals with the two contrasting problems.
First, the requirement of large training overheads when all
the LIS units are passive, and second the need of higher
power consumption and higher hardware complexity when
all the LIS elements are active. To resolve these issues,
the authors proposed LIS architecture where merely few
LIS elements are active and then presented two different
solutions; one using CS and another using deep learning.
Further the authors manifested that although both the solutions showed to achieve near-optimal data rate incurring
negligible training overheads, the approach with deep learning needs lesser number of LIS active elements and does not
need the knowledge of LIS array geometry. Nevertheless,
sufficient dataset is required as input for deep learning
approach. Jung et al. carried out analysis of System
Spectral Efficient (SSE) of an uplink LIS system considering
a practical LIS environment and reported asymptotic analysis can correctly indicate the performance of the LIS system
VOLUME 2, 2021
ALWIS et al.: SURVEY ON 6G FRONTIERS: TRENDS, APPLICATIONS, REQUIREMENTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND FUTURE RESEARCH
and thus extensive simulation is not required. Further, the
authors proposed optimum pilot training length which can
help achieve maximum SSE irrespective of the pilot contamination. The work proposed to integrate LIS (or
RIS) to Index Modulation (IM) to achieve higher spectral
efficiency even at very low SNR for future 6G networks.
In particular, the author put forward two schemes RISspace shift keying (RIS-SSK) and RIS-spatial modulation
(RIS-SM). The works , , highlighted the
importance of LIS (or RIS) for 6G networks. In particular, primarily focused on the categorization of the
recent works concerning LIS and provided significant list of open challenges besides discussing state-of-art
RIS hardware designs. The work explains integration of IRS with latest transmission technologies like
mmWave communication, NOMA transmission, and PLS
Summary: By covering the man-made structures with
either antennas or metasurfaces, the propagation of environment can be controlled thereby turning them into intelligent
surfaces. Majority of the work so far focused on changing
the phase of the incident signal, though other characteristics can also be acted on. Integrated use of techniques like
ML and deep learning are looked up to achieve the required
intelligence for LISs.
I. NON-TERRESTRIAL NETWORKS (NTN) TOWARDS 3D
NETWORKING
In conventional ground-centric mobile networks the functioning of base stations are optimized to primarily cater the needs
of ground uses. Moreover, the elevation angle provided to the
antennas at ground base stations are focusing on the ground
user for better directivity and hence cannot support aerial
users , . Such mobile network allows marginal
vertical movement (i.e., above and below the ground surface)
thus predominantly offers two dimensional (2D) connectivity. NTN expands the 2D connectivity by adding altitude as
the third dimension – . NTNs are capable of providing coverage, trunking, backhauling and supporting high
speed mobility in unserved or underserved areas through
the integration of UAVs, satellites (in particular Very Low
Earth Orbit (VLEO)), tethered balloons, and High Altitude
Platform (HAP) stations , , . The development of protocols and architectural solutions for New Radio
(NR) operations in NTNs are promoted in 3GPP Rel-17
and is expected to continue in Rel-18 and Rel-19 . 3D
networking further extends the NTN paradigm allowing 6G
to emerge as global communication system by extending its
coverage from ground to air towards space, underground, and
underwater , . Interestingly, Aerial Base Stations
(ABS) powered by UAV technology can offer on-demand,
broadband, and reliable wireless coverage in cost-effective
and agile way. Some of the promising characteristics of
UAV-enabled ABS based on , , are as
• Intelligent 3D mobility and ease of maneuvering.
• Varying capabilities in terms of computation, storage,
power backup, etc. to meet heterogeneous demands.
• LoS communication that allows effective beamformimg
in three dimension.
• high flexibility in terms of number of antenna elements
when UAVs are used to create antenna array for 3D
1) IMPORTANCE TO 6G
There has been exponential increase in number of connected devices in recent past and the trend will continue
with higher rate of increase in future. In particular, future is
expected to see significant increase in aerial users or aerial
connected devices. Technological advancements in various
fields, like electronics and sensor technology, high speed
links, data communication networking, aviation technology,
etc., provide necessary ecosystem for robust growth of UAVs
(aka drones) which has in turn extended the horizon of
UAV’s applications. By 2022, the fleet of small model UAVs
(primarily used for recreational purposes by hobbyists) is
expected to reach a mark of 1.38 million units whereas small
non-model UAVs (primarily used for commercial purposes)
are forecast to be 789000 million units as per the Federal
Aviation Administration FAA’s report . Moreover, by
same year, i.e., 2022, the global market of UAVs is estimated to value at US$ 68.6 billion . Hence, 6G mobile
networks is expected to provide required connectivity to such
increasing number of aerial users. To fulfil this expectation,
3D networking paradigm is going to play a key enabling
role in 6G.
2) RELATED WORK
Authors in have proposed a framework for UAVbased 3D cellular network for beyond 5G that provide
a solutions for placement of UAV-ABS in three dimension (using truncated octahedron approach) as well as
latency-sensitive association of UAV-based user equipment
to UAV-ABS. In , authors have put forward 3D
non-stationary Geometry-Based Stochastic Model (GBSM)
for UAV-to-ground channels that are envisioned in UAVintegrated 6G mobile networks. GBSM is proposed to
work well for mmWave and massive MIMO configurations.
Strinati et al. proposes to extend the intelligence to the
edge 3D networks (i.e., beyong the premises of 2D networks)
by leveraging edge computing paradigm. In particularly, the
work envision to integrated flying base stations with ground
stations by using technologies like MEC, SDN, and AI.
Summary: NTN evolved towards 3D networking to enable
global radio coverage and capacity in three dimensions for
future 6G networks. It represents a gamut of technologies
like UAVs, HAPs, satellites, and other flying gadgets that
are anticipated to work in harmony to offer seamless coverage over space, air, ground, underwater and underground.
AI/ML based solutions are expected to play an important
VOLUME 2, 2021
role to overcome the limitations posed by physical absence
of human beings.
J. VISIBLE LIGHT COMMUNICATION (VLC)
Communication
technologies
light for short-range communication . The frequency
spectrum for VLC is between 430 THz to 790 THz. Further,
in VLC the most common devices used for transmission are
Light Emitting Diode (LED) and Light Amplification by
Stimulated Emission of Radiation (LASER) diodes, whereas,
for reception photodetectors such as silicon photodiode, PIN
Photo-Diode (PD) and PIN Avalanche Photo-Diode (APD)
are used – . Some of the advantages of using VLC
technology based on , , are as follows:
(i) visible light spectrum is free to use since falls under
unlicensed band, (ii) very high bandwidth as compared to
RF signals (visible light spectrum is 104 times higher than
radio waves ), (iii) high spatial reusability since visible
light is blocked by objects like walls, (iv) permits precise
estimation of direction-of-arrival, (v) supports very high
data rate (10 Gbps using LED and 100 Gpbs using LASER
diodes ), (vi) low energy consumption with the use
of LEDs, (vii) inherently secure due to unidirectional
propagation, signal isolation and non-penetrating nature
of visible light, (viii) less costly as compared to radio
communication especially in mmWave and THz range, (ix)
safe to be used for communication since it meets the eye
and skin regulations . Moreover, the existing radio
frequency band and visible light band are well separated
thus there is no electromagnetic interference .
1) IMPORTANCE TO 6G
VLC came into existence with the emergence of white
LEDs and has matured over the last two decades for it
to be considered as an enabling technology for 6G ,
 . The technology has been successfully used for various applications scenarios such as vehicular communications,
underwater communications, indoor areas (homes, offices,
hospitals, aircraft cabins), visible light identification system,
and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), underground
mines , . Since, VLC operates in THz range thus
is offers ultra-high bandwidth which means it can well satisfy the capacity and data rate demands of 6G . From
the 6G point-of-view, a hybrid communication infrastructure can be developed leveraging the best of visible light
communication and other conventional communications like
RF, Wi-Fi, Infrared (IR), and Power Line Communication
(PLC) , , . For instance, to establish RF-
VLC hybrid system use of RIS has been suggested. Here,
RIS can control the propagation environment and ensure the
LoS communication between base station and mobile device
equipped with photodetector .
2) RELATED WORK
Some of the related work pertaining to the use of VLC in
6G are discussed in this subsection. Soderi aims to
improve the physical layer security of VLC and proposed
Watermarked Blind Physical Layer Security (WBPLSec) protocol. In particular, mitigating the confidentiality attacks in
VLC was the prime concern of the author and to do so
authors used RGB LEDs, spread spectrum watermarking
technique, and jamming receiver. Author suggest the use of
WBPLSec protocol based VLC can be used transact secret
shared key between authentic receiver and devices in an
indoor environment. Lee also targeted to improve the
security of VLC communication system tailored for smart
indoor services in 6G ear. Author proposed the use of
asymmetric Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) encryption for
securing data communication and for exchanging secret key.
Further, the work studied the optimum key length for public
or private encryption codes and performance of VLC system
for these key lengths. Cui et al. have pointed out that
VLC transmission may also results in spill over transmission
in side channels which lead to security issues. Even though
an adversary is not present in the same area (i.e., blocked) it
can still sniff this side channel leakage and can gain access
information. Authors designed low-cost VLC sniffing system
that can tap information simultaneously from multiple VLC
systems which are few meters away even with the presence
of concrete wall as an obstacle.
Summary: VLC, in general considered to be highly secure
communication technology, can still be compromised and
prone to vulnerabilities. Hence, for the wide adoption of
VLC in 6G ecosystem efforts are required to design efficient systems (with minimum leakage) and at the same time
techniques (and equipment) are required to crosscheck the
efficacy of VLC systems . Furthermore, though the use
of sophisticated encryption techniques enhances the security
of VLC systems, however, the cost is paid in terms of high
computational overheads. Thus, lightweight encryption techniques specifically designed for visible light systems will be
required to better meet the needs of 6G services. Also, so
far the VLC system have been mostly used for indoor environment, nevertheless, more research is required to explore
its use in outdoor scenarios.
K. QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
As per , the role of quantum systems for telecommunication and networking fall under two different categories;
quantum communication and quantum computing. Quantum
communication, as put forward by Gisin and Thew ,
is a way to transfer a quantum state from a sender to a
receiver. It can enable the execution of the tasks that either
cannot be performed or inefficiently performed using classical techniques , . Some of the interesting offerings
of quantum communication are Quantum Key Distribution
(QKD), Quantum Secure Direct Communication (QSDC),
Quantum Secret Sharing (QSS), quantum teleportation, quantum network (quantum channel, quantum repeaters, quantum
memory and quantum server) . One of the promising
use of quantum communication is the secure distribution
of cryptographic keys referred QKD. The techniques that
VOLUME 2, 2021
ALWIS et al.: SURVEY ON 6G FRONTIERS: TRENDS, APPLICATIONS, REQUIREMENTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND FUTURE RESEARCH
use quantum entanglement for this purpose are called as
entanglement-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) .
Any kind of man-in-middle attack while using QKD can be
detected easily as the attacker disturbs the quantum (shared
joint) state and this disturbance can be known by examining
the correlations between the communicating entities .
1) IMPORTANCE TO 6G
Quantum communication is foreseen to play a crucial role
in realizing secure 6G communications. In particular, the
underlying principles of quantum entanglement and its nonlocality, superposition, inalienable law and non-cloning theorem pave the way for strong security. The next generation of
services that are going to be increasingly supported by quantum communication are HT, tactile Internet, BCI, extremely
massive and intelligent communications , . This
QKD protocols have shown the most progress and numerous practical implementation of such protocols have been
shown which reflects their potential applicability in 6G
networks , . Yet another interesting use of quantum
communication is its applicability for secure long distance
communication . This, in particular, would be interesting
since it is envisioned that 6G will have special focus on
LDHMC that would deal with extremely long distance
communications.
2) RELATED WORK
Nawaz et al. surveyed various paradigms like quantum
communication, quantum computing assisted communication, and quantum assisted machine learning based communication that utilizes machine learning and quantum computing
in a synergetic manner. The advent of quantum computing
facilities poses a significant treat to traditional cryptographic
techniques that are used to encrypt data in current wireless communication systems. Thus, the work exploits
QKD mechanism for key generation and management in
5G IoT scenario. Authors named the proposed protocol as
Quantum Key GRID for Authentication and Key Agreement
(QKG-AKA) and analytically showed that security cannot
be broken in polynomial time. Abd EL-Latif et al. 
proposed two hash functions (for 5G applications) that
utilizes Quantum Walks (QW), namely, QWHF-1 and
QWHF-2 (Quantum Walk Hash Function 1 and 2). Further,
QWHF-1 was in turn used to develop Authentication Key
Distribution (AKD) protocol and QWHF-2 was used to
develop Authenticated Quantum Direction Communication
(AQDC) protocol for Device-to-Device (D2D) communications. Zavitsanos et al. studied applicability of QKD
for securing fronthaul that offers low-latency connectivity to
myriad of 5G terminals. In particular, the authors investigated
fronthaul link that integrates BB84 and QKD and supports
AES encryption. Their work paves the way towards quantum
secure fronthaul infrastructure for 5G/B5G networks.
Summary: Quantum communication is very promising
application of the principles of quantum physics in the world
of communication. Some of the techniques provided by QC
are quantum teleportation, quantum network, QKD, QSDC
and QSS. Various upcoming applications of QC are Quantum
Optical Twin (QOT), HT, tactile Internet, BCI, and long distance intelligent communication. In spite of the hype, the
establishing synergy between QC and classical communication will be challenging. So far most of advancements are
limited to QKD.
Table 5 presents in nutshell the importance of each
technology in the sense that what the technology is and
what it offers to 6G. Further, the table tries to map the
level of importance each technology serves for six identified broad future directions. Moreover, Table 6 highlights
the key challenges related to 6G technologies and possible
solutions.

F. SOUTH KOREA MSIT 6G RESEARCH PROGRAM
The South Korean Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) 
is working on ambitious plan to be the first country to launch
6G networks. The government of South Korea expects 6G
services could be commercially available in Korea between
2028 and 2030. First deployment of 6G networks will be
available in 2028 and mass scale commercial deployment
will happen in 2030. The Korean government will invest
a total of KRW 200 billion ($169 million) during 2021-

strategy to launch a 6G pilot by 2026. Five major areas
(i.e., digital healthcare immersive content, self-driving cars,
smart cities and smart factories) are identified for these pilot
The MSIT has also formed the “6G R&D Strategy

VIII. FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS AND GENERAL
CHALLENGES IN 6G
The present understanding of 6G provides a broad vision
towards future research directions and key challenges in realizing 6G mobile networks , . We formulate future
research directions related to 6G under six main domains,
as illustrated in Fig. 10.
• Ultimate Mobile Experience: The extreme connectivity provided by 6G is expected to deliver an
ultimate mobile experience through a myriad of emerging applications, personalized services and gadget free
communication.
• Hyper −Intelligent Networking: Large scale deployments of AI/ML enabled networks.
• Harmonized Networks: Smooth interconnection of
multiple communication technologies, data storage
and processing platforms, etc. at different scales and
platforms.
• Sustainable
Energy-optimized/energyharvesting network infrastructure with minimal carbon
footprint.
• Extreme Global Network Coverage: Digital inclusion
through seamless global service coverage by connecting
remote, rural, deep sea and even space locations.
• Ultimate Security, Privacy and Trust: Guaranteed
data security, privacy, and trust in the digital world.
FIGURE 10. Towards 6G - Future Directions and Challenges , .
A. ULTIMATE MOBILE EXPERIENCE
6G is expected to provide an ultimate mobile experience
by enabling many new applications. For instance, HT will
project realistic 3D holograms of people and objects in
real-time. Further, personalized BANs will be integrated
with smart healthcare systems to provide better healthcare
services. Also, digital services will be provided through gadget free communication models using tactile Internet, digital
interfaces and sensors that are integrated in to the environment, and haptics , . Many other applications
including XR, IoH and CAVs are expected to provide an
ultimate mobile experience to users. These applications will
only be realistic with 6G that has FeMBB to provide Tbps
data rates, extreme reliability to facilitate communication at
a reliability of 99.99999%, ultra low latency below 1 ms,
and ultra low processing delay in the range of 10 ns .
1) LESSONS LEARNED
5G evolved from 4G to provide eMBB with up to 10 Gbps
peak rates, 1 ms latency, and 99.999% high availability and
reliability to enable applications such as AR, ultra high definition video streaming, faster file downloads and remote
operation of some industrial devices. However, the rapid
growth of applications such as XR, HT, CAVs, IoH and
UAVs, will require connectivity that surpasses 5G capabilities. Realizing applications such as CAVs and tele-surgery
would require ultra-reliable and extremely-low latency connectivity beyond the capabilities of 5G . Moreover,
these applications will require powerful edge intelligence
capabilities to process data in near real-time . for
instance, holographic communication requires the processing and transferring of large number of pixels in real-time to
provide a ultimate user experience . 5G network systems
are also not capable of efficiently dealing with the dynamic
VOLUME 2, 2021
requirements of UAVs that will be utilized in diverse environments , . The network reliability, scalability,
low delay and fault tolerance in 5G networks are also not
sufficient to realize a smooth UAV network . CAVs also
require unprecedented levels of reliability (> 99.99999%)
and low latency (< 1 ms) even in ultra-high mobility
scenarios (> 1000 km/h) . Furthermore, the lack of
edge intelligence capabilities in 5G is a significant shortcoming that is expected to be addressed in beyond 5G
communication systems .
2) RELATED LIMITATIONS AND RELEVANT RESEARCH
Following are the key limitations and relevant research questions that needs to be addressed to realize the ultimate mobile
experience envisaged with 6G.
• How to provide Tbps data rates to enable FeMBB,
extreme reliability and availability in the range of
99.99999%, and ultra low latency below 1 ms?
• How can nearby devices cooperatively provide powerful edge intelligence capabilities to provide <10 ns
processing delays?
• What are the way to integrate sensors and interfaces
in to the environment to provide seamless gadget-free
communication?
• How to connect and transfer data from up to 1 million
connected devices per km2?
• What is the way to ensure a smooth user experience in
services such as HT and XR?
• How to manage SLAs for trillions of users while ensuring the required QoS, Quality-of-Experience (QoE) and
Quality-of-Physical-Experience (QoPE)?
3) FUTURE WORK
6G communication networks are expected to provide peak
data rates at the range of Tbps banking on the envisaged
developments in technologies such as THz communication,
ultra-high beamforming, better coding schemes and channel
access schemes. In , authors present recent advances
in low-latency and ultra-high reliable networks to propose
a framework for modeling and optimizing uRLLC-centric
problems at the network level. However, improving these
technologies to meet the expected 6G KPIs requires further research work. The smooth amalgamation of wireless
networks together with cloud/edge/fog platforms that provides data processing and storage facilities is essential to
empower future 6G communication networks with edge intelligence capabilities. Furthermore, developing metrics such as
QoPE, which is capable of combining QoS, QoE, and human
perceptions, owing to the recent developments in machine
learning is essential to provide services such as XR and holographic communication such that the human brain is able
to perceive a realistic experience . In addition, existing
network security and privacy measures are also expected
to see new developments to facilitate 6G networks and
applications. For instance, novel approaches including secure
FIGURE 11. Dynamic instantiation and optimal placement of virtual micro services
functions enabled by real-time AI/ML in the 6G era.
channel coding, channel based adaptation, quantum key distribution and quantum teleportation are being investigated to
be used with future 6G communication networks .
B. HYPER-INTELLIGENT NETWORKING
The previous network generations, from 1G to 5G, have
become more complex in many aspects. Moreover, the
network has expanded in both horizontal and vertical dimensions. These reasons have motivated the use of intelligent and
autonomous approaches to solving various design problems
such as air interface, resource allocation, network orchestration and selection, intelligent radio signal processing,
adaptive monitoring, interfaces and abstractions, and full
network programability , as shown in Fig. 11. To enable
hyper-intelligent networking in future 6G networks, there is
a need for deeply embedding AI solutions to the network,
especially when the solution cannot be obtained efficiently
or in close-forms via conventional approaches.
1) LESSONS LEARNED
Many AI frameworks, including are machine learning ,
deep reinforcement learning , deep learning, distributed learning , FL , and computational intelligence , have been investigated to enable hyperintelligent networking such as AI-driven air interface, intelligent orchestration, and node programmability. For example,
the reconfigurability and adaptability of radio systems can
be obtained via end-to-end learning design . Since
impairments, typically caused by analog radio hardware, can
affect the network performance significantly, deep learning
has been considered a promising solution . To enable
efficient modulation classification in fast fading networks,
a deep convolutional neural network is proposed in 
which can achieve very competitive performance in terms
of classification accuracy and inference time as well as outperform various machine learning based approaches. The
VOLUME 2, 2021

potential application of swarm intelligence, a brand of AI,
and machine learning for UAV-enabled VLC is considered in , where non-linear channel models in VLC
are handled by a swarm intelligence approach effectively.
More recently, a deep reinforcement learning approach is
developed in to maximize the minimum secrecy rate
in an IRS-enabled multi-user multi-eavesdropper network.
The use of deep reinforcement learning is to overcome the
challenges caused by outdated/imperfect and highly-variant
channel state information in IRS systems.
AI will play a vital role in automatic conflict avoidance
in 6G. As the 6G networks are pacing towards infrastructure less networks, thus, it is inevitable to neglect conflicts
in terms of resource sharing and delay minimization tasks.
Furthermore, service providers and operators might also
create conflicts in order to maximize their profits, this phenomenon is termed as greedy behavior. These conflicts will
affect the user experience as well as the service provision.
Therefore, it is necessary to resolve conflicts while dealing with heterogeneous technologies in terms of networks,
operators, and resources . One of the ways to resolve
conflicts is to use AI for deriving conflict management policies . The policy will first detect the conflict if one
arises and recommends an action that prioritizes the needs
of a user to enhance the quality of service. It is highly recommended that a module comprising of policies for conflict
detection and resolution be integrated within a 6G communication system network for seamless and user friendly
Although AI solutions have been shown to have outstanding performance if compared with conventional optimization
approaches, there are still several limitations related to the
use of AI in wireless communication networks. For instance,
the performance of deep learning methods highly relies
on the quality and size of datasets used for training. However,
the requirement of a standard dataset of highly dynamic and
complex networks is typically unavailable. Consequently, it
may be difficult to compare the performance of different
AI solutions for the same problem. Moreover, conventional
methods still perform well in many cases, especially when
closed-form and/or non-extract but high-quality solutions can
be obtained. This requires holistic usages of both conventional and AI approaches to enable hyper-intelligence in
future 6G networks.
2) RELATED LIMITATIONS AND RELEVANT RESEARCH
There are several barriers and research questions that need
to be solved for hyper-intelligent networking in 6G.
• How to create standard and high-quality datasets for
learning tasks for networks with different characteristics
(e.g., radio access technologies, densification level, and
channel modeling)?
• How to devise a holistic design of both conventional and
AI approaches so that wireless services can be provided
in real-time?
• How to handle the explainability of the operation of
underlying networks since almost all AI solutions in
the available literature are implemented in a black-box
• How to provide hybrid centralized-distributed AI solutions to exploit powerful computing capabilities of the
central cloud servers as well as the computing resources
available at massive IoT devices at the network edge?
• How to leverage AI solutions to enable the full network
programmability so as to support flexible and software
based implementation of 6G systems?
• How to develop predictive orchestration mechanisms
to achieve the goals of supporting a few billion IoT
devices, zero-latency services, and extremely large
• The use of transfer learning is necessary to reuse the
learning models that have been well trained and well
performed. Moreover, unsupervised learning is promising to reduce the labeling cost as well as exploit a
vast amount of unlabeled data generated from massive network components in 6G. So a research question
is how to effectively leverage transfer learning and
unsupervised learning in future 6G systems?
3) FUTURE WORK
Future 6G wireless networks will guarantee global coverage
and provide services with various QoS satisfaction levels.
In this network, storage and computing capabilities are distributed over the whole network, from the central cloud to
the MEC server at the network edge and wearable computing
devices at the user side. Obviously, AI is a key enabler for
hyper-intelligent networking in 6G networks. Explainable AI
solutions should be investigated so that the underlying operations of the network can be explained well. Moreover, to
exploit the computing capabilities and generated data from
massive IoT devices, hybrid centralized-distributed AI solutions are very promising. In particular, the global server,
deployed at central clouds and satellites, can be leveraged to
build a learning model over multiple regions of the world.
As transferring a large amount of data from massive IoT
devices to a central server is not efficient and sometimes
unavailable, the data can be processed hierarchically, from
end devices to edge nodes (e.g., terrestrial and aerial base
stations) and global nodes. Moreover, FL is a promising
concept to design privacy-preserving solutions.
C. HARMONIZED NETWORKS
Similar to 5G networks, the 6G networks will also need to
utilize both Stand-Alone (SA) and Non-SA (NSA) deployments leveraging both legacy networks and also future NR to
enable new use cases, satisfy the new network requirements,
provide extreme coverage and also support flexible deployment of network resources. Thus, the 6G will interconnect
the different types of networks ranging from VLC to satellite by aggregating resources and technologies from IoT
devices to core-network/cloud infrastructure. Specially, NTN
VOLUME 2, 2021
towards 3D networks are needed in 6G to achieve the
global service coverage by offering full digital inclusion
in the area such as deep sea and space. New 6G applications with enhanced human machine interaction and human
cyber-physical interaction will be needed exploiting sensors/biosensors. In this context BCIs and other biosensors
will be used. 6G should also support the communication
related to this area as well.
1) LESSONS LEARNED
To enable harmonized networks, 6G should utilize new
advanced networking technologies such as autonomous mesh
networks , , nanonetwork or nanoscale network
concepts , , scalable D2D communication 
in addition to the legacy wireless technologies. Moreover,
the spectrum bands used in 6G may be above 100 GHz.
Moreover, novel and alternative computing paradigms, e.g.,
serverless schemes , , in conjunction with ultraflexible splitting of functionality between end devices and
edge nodes are also needed to satisfy the demand of new
6G applications. Moreover, 6G harmonized networks should
be utilized both AI and network programmability concepts
to automate the harmonization.
There are some limitations related to 5G system architecture. For instance, the 5G architecture is not optimally
designed for integrating new features, such as managing
nodes operating at above 100 GHz frequencies, interconnecting millions of sub- and mesh-networks, and network
procedures exploitation by using AI. Therefore, it is needed
in 6G to integrate and leverage these trends at 6G concept development phase to offer significant improvements in
flexibility, cost efficiency and also reduced complexity.
Moreover, 6G network harmonization will cover various new environments such as modular flexible production
cells, zero-energy sensors, solutions for on-demand connectivity in remote areas with different stakeholders. Since
different networks have different network characteristics, the
network harmonization in 6G will allows to provide required
coverage and connectivity, dependability, and also satisfy
the requirement of heterogeneous networking environments.
Moreover, AI enabled network harmonization will allow
6G to deploy ultra-flexible resource allocation procedures
in challenging environments, such as those populated by
mobile devices with special requirements (e.g., reliability,
energy-efficiency, security) and in need of coverage (e.g., in
emergency scenarios or in remote areas).
2) RELATED LIMITATIONS AND RELEVANT RESEARCH
Following limitations and research questions are required to
be addressed to enable harmonized networks in 6G.
• What is the new 6G architecture which can harmonized networks to enable flexible network typologies
and backward compatibility for legacy networks?
• How to harmonized different networks to achieve the
convergence of the biological, digital and physical
• What are the architectural options which can enable the
allocation, instantiation and operation of AI processing
functions over harmonized network deployments?
• How to tackle the large variations of available capacity
at short timescales in 6G applications at architecture
• What are the possible global level optimization mechanism to increase the collaborative utilization of available
resources at different networks?
• How to enable the cooperation between different
networks in a trustworthy manner?
• How to create new services such as dynamic function
placement, network programmability and processing of
offloading at a global level in harmonized networks?
• What are the possible supporting protocols which can
enable integrated and distributed AI to automate the
network harmonization?
• How to design an automated and intelligent harmonized network equipped with distributed computing
capabilities?
• How to develop technologies for new harmonized
network requirements such as network function refactoring, run time scheduling of network resources and
predictive orchestration?
• How to enable the integration in wireless networks with
closely interacting BCI/human-machine interactions?
3) FUTURE WORK
harmonization
integration
above 100 GHz spectrum (including optical), NTNs, nano
networks, autonomous D2D and cell-free MIMO. One of the
key enablers for such harmonization in 6G era will be the
enhancement of radio access visualization methods. It will
enable abstraction and programability which are essential to
develop harmonized networks in 6G.
6G should evolve as new service-based network which
can be enabled via network harmonization. Service based
networks have optimal service independency, flexibility and
re-usability. 6G can achieve this by evolving from fully
cloud-native network functions in 5G to alternative compute
paradigms such as serverless architectures. This approach
will need redesign the signalling procedures and interfaces
in legacy mobile architectures.
For a better realization, network harmonization should
support crucial factors such as high reliability, accountability, availability and liability. The cross-layer technologies
such as communication-control co-design , and
spatiotemporal network design , and also novel
computing techniques such as blockchain can be used
achieve above requirements. Moreover, the end results of
harmonization can be further improved by using prediction
or projection of trajectory, resource, and spectrum usage.

D. SUSTAINABLE NETWORKS
To meet global sustainability, energy efficient networks, zero
energy network resource management, and green computing, needs to be achieved along with acceptable quality
of service. The communication systems are exhibiting the
aforementioned characteristics can be considered as sustainable networks. Together with 6G, AI can help in measuring
network activity and identifying the demand requirement by
analyzing trends and patterns from the acquired data. The
system learned using AI can be applied for redirecting the
energy resources in real-time so that the consumption of
power can be reduced and efficiently utilized .
Recently, many works have been proposed for the realization of self-sustainable networks. Du focused on
reducing the computational complexity of data clustering
algorithms for improving the energy efficiency of communication networks. Maddikunta et al. opted for an
optimization algorithm to reduce the energy consumption
of the communication network when selecting the cluster
head. Che et al. highlighted the energy transmission
problem in UAVs propagated through ground terminals. The
study have highlighted the importance of two-way sustainability when implementing 6G communication systems.
The study suggest that 6G intrinsically supports green communication policies and relies on self-sustaining protocols.
The realization of secure and end to end autonomous
systems have challenges in terms of service classes such
as ultrahigh data density, low-latency communications, and
ubiquitous mobile broadband. Moreover, the provision of
unlimited wireless connectivity necessitates the networks
to be deployed in underwater, space, ground, and air
respectively that entails the use of flexible materials.
1) LESSONS LEARNED
In order to attain sustainability in the communication
systems, a holistic approach is required to be adapted rather
than only focusing on the radio access or transmission part.
Studies have suggested that the energy wastes and carbon
footprints can be reduced by employing AI approaches that
can adapt to the network traffic demands . This process
can be accomplished by employing schedule based mechanisms to turn the base stations ON or OFF. Alternatively,
traffic steering or cell zooming methods can also be
employed to improve the efficiency of resource utilization.
Similarly, based on user’s demand the services can be turned
off or switched to low-resolution. In the context of energy
utilization and weather conditions, the systems could use
sensing approaches for scale the utilization in order to avoid
outages and over-flows. The conventional base stations and
new radios need to be offloaded or moved to the advanced 6G
enabled edge computing facilities to achieve massive lowlatency communications. This may result in energy barriers
at the end of edge devices. In this regard, AI and 6G can be
used in a combined manner to co-design energy-sustainable
and cost-effective computing and communication protocols.
Furthermore, Blockchain and optimization techniques can
play a vital role in re-strategizing the resources while opting
for decentralized systems to reduce bottlenecks, accordingly.
To this end, we presume that the sustainable networks, in
general, is the way forward for eco-friendly communication
2) RELATED LIMITATIONS AND RELEVANT RESEARCH
There are still a lot of challenges that need to be explored
and solved in order to realize a potential self-sustainable
communication system. Some of the challenges are listed
• Advanced Power transfer and Energy harvesting techniques from heterogeneous devices for green communication.
• Network sustainability to users with varying levels of
processing power.
• Super Energy efficient algorithms for a massive number
of devices.
• Advanced handling strategies and designs for unstructured or semi-structured data from resource-constrained
• Smart energy and resource management algorithms for
6G networks.
• Advanced 6G enabled reconfigurable intelligent surfaces for sustainable communication.
• Extended adaptive coding techniques for data compression.
• Improving network traffic, security and privacy issues
with the fusion of distributed ledger technology and 6G.
3) FUTURE WORK
Attaining sustainability in communication systems is a challenging task and the efforts needs to be put in from all
directions. Verma et al. proposed the use of hybrid
whale spotted hyena optimization to improve the selection
of cluster heads in 6G to enable communication. Although,
it is one of the components to be dealt with but in general
other communication protocols and network resource management can also be optimized using the aforementioned
strategy. Another challenge is to offload some of the centralized services to nearby edge computing facilities and that
could be performed through federated and transfer learning approaches. Recently Liu et al. proposed the use
of FL approaches for 6G communications. However, the
same can be leveraged for designing personalized systems,
or using cached content for user-centric services that could
reduce the burden from access networks. Previously, we also
shed light on the use of scheduling services for base stations or new radios in 5G and 6G networks. In this regard,
multiple domains including AI and optimization techniques
integrated with 6G technology can help in reducing the number of transmissions or energy requirement by strategizing
the sleep and wake schedule of base stations. For instance,
Wang et al. recently proposed hybrid energy powered cellular network that could plan the wake-up strategies

for base stations in order to balance the network resources
and increasing energy efficiency. The same can be opted
for selection of route strategies, network load switching and
balancing, respectively.
E. EXTREME GLOBAL NETWORK COVERAGE
6G is conceptualized to go much beyond the maximum coverage that can be achieved by full-fledged deployment of 5G.
In other words, by 2030, 6G energized telecommunication
industry is expected to offer global services encompassing
remote places (e.g., rural areas), oceans, vast-land masses
with low inhabitants, air and space. The obvious advantages
will be the minimization of digital divide by connecting
everyone and everything, higher business opportunities in
every part of the world supported by the continuous growth
in local operators, and easy roll out of essential services like
safety and basic governmental benefits.
1) LESSONS LEARNED
Even with 5G, originally conceived as terrestrial networks,
it is presumed that considerable parts of the globe will be
uncovered . These parts of the earth mostly include
oceans, desserts, deep forest, rural areas, mountains, and
airspace. Thus, 6G is believed to overcome this shortfall of
predecessor generations and emerge as universal communication systems offering ubiquitous global coverage. Some
of the technologies that have been identified to play a vital
role in driving the extreme coverage are UAVs as mobile
and agile aerial base stations, satellites in particular LEO and
VLEO for broader coverage, cell-free architecture based on
distributed MIMO allows devices to avail multiple simultaneous connectivity to APs, Terahertz and VLC offer new
resources to boost capacity, blockchain-integrated AI that
can allow efficient spectrum management, and decentralized
business ecosystem that incentivizes players of all sizes to
participate in extending the radio footprints. Thus, 6G with
its extreme global coverage is envisaged to be a key enabler
for never-seen-before type of applications and will also minimize the digital divide. The latter is especially important in
the emergency or global pandemic situations like COVID-19.
2) RELATED LIMITATIONS AND RELEVANT RESEARCH
Following are the interesting research questions that need
to be answered to realize the 6G’s vision of extreme global
• How to intelligently manage the seamless 3D mobility
while moving vertically up (in air or space) or down
the ground level?
• How to efficiently manage and control swarm of LEO
and VLEO satellites as well as enable them secure and
cost-efficient inter-communication ?
• What could be the time-efficient solutions that can help
overcome Doppler shift and Doppler variation issues
that occur due to the relative motion of earth and LEO
satellite ?
• How to optimize power radiation and improve system
efficiency while achieving global coverage?
• What are the channel models that can be used for heterogeneous scenarios (for, e.g., UAV, maritime, satellite,
and V2V) that will use different frequency bands like
mmWave and THz band ?
• How to develop an automated, open and decentralized
wireless market that motivates business entities of all
sizes to participate realizing global coverage?
3) FUTURE WORK
Some of the important areas that need dedicated research
inputs are presented in this subsection. In context of flying
relays or base stations, we need optimized 3D localization and network planning . These areas of research
become even more important since UAVs can have resource
constraint and are characterized by heterogeneous processing and storage capacities. Another area of future work
concerning global network coverage would be secure interoperability among various operators and smart 3D roaming
mechanisms applicable for heterogeneous networks utilizing
different technologies. FL based optimization where different networks train locally the ML models and instead of
sharing data these network share the updates on the model.
Hence, FL has potential to globally optimize 6G ecosystem
while ensuring ubiquitous network coverage. Yet another
area of future work that can drive extreme global coverage is
channel estimation and dynamic link optimization. Advance
techniques are required in this area to provide efficient and
cost-effective solutions for ubiquitous coverage.
F. SECURITY, PRIVACY, AND TRUST
6G is a great vision and it will bring new and life changing
technology developments. These developments will guide
the world towards vast enhancements with extremely ambitious goals such as, zero carbon footprint, climate ecosystems
and so on, through the deployment of goal-oriented technologies, communications and applications. As discussed in
Section III, few of applications are being and/or will be
enabled by a trillion of heterogeneous devices. These devices
will further collect sensitive data to support various services
through the wireless centric computing in the digital world.
Nevertheless, in this new trend of computing centric services
and 6C convergence, cyber-attacks will present another but
unavoidable issues for 6G security. For instance, detecting
AI based attacks would be challenging in extremely massive network of networks. In addition, several stakeholders
including consumers will be collecting and monitoring data
through various devices and networks that may pose several
privacy issues. In , the authors demonstrated the privacy threat in 3G, 4G and 5G. Such security and privacy
issues may lead to the trustworthiness issues in 6G applications and networks, as discussed in , . Therefore, it
goes without saying that security, privacy and trust are worth
studying before 6G planning, designing and deployments.

ALWIS et al.: SURVEY ON 6G FRONTIERS: TRENDS, APPLICATIONS, REQUIREMENTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND FUTURE RESEARCH
1) LESSONS LEARNED
It can be noticed from the deriving treads (refer to Section II),
applications (refer to Section III) and enabling technologies
(refer to Section V) that the 6G will be heavily relaying
on the new paradigm of reliable communications, intelligent
applications, and ubiquitous services. These new paradigms
will open new attack vectors that may lead to security, privacy and trust vulnerabilities to the networks, systems and
applications. However, the existing deployed 4G and 5G
networks contain certain security holes that can lead to many
attacks. For instance a recent report reported that existing 4G
and 5G are vulnerable to the denial of services attacks ,
 . More precisely, the report revealed – the Diameter
Signaling Protocol (DSP) that coordinates data through several Internet Protocols from different locations. Here it is
worth to note that the DSP is unable to identify illegitimate
and legitimate packets and thus it may lead to coordinated
DoS attacks or other privacy issues. Furthermore, in ,
the authors demonstrated the security and privacy threat in
3G, 4G and 5G. Similarly, many other instances of security and privacy vulnerabilities are reported in IoT ,
Smart Grid , edge computing , and so on. In
addition, detecting AI based attacks would be challenging
in extremely massive network of networks. Therefore, the
immediate lesson leaned from such vulnerabilities is that
they can impact in many ways in 6G networks and applications, ranging from benign disruption to act of sabotage,
threatening individual live to economic fraud and even more
the national security threats. Another lesson learned from
previous technologies is the data leakage (i.e., for individual’s or community’s privacy) threats. Malicious attackers
can mount data extraction attacks that can fly under the
radar, which can put individual’s privacy at a risk within
their application domains. Hence, security, privacy (along
with trust) should be considered as a performance target of
wireless computing in 6G.
2) RELATED LIMITATIONS AND RELEVANT RESEARCH
As the scale of 6G networks, applications and services is
massive (which is not finalized yet), deploying security, privacy and trust measures are challenging. Few of challenges
are listed as follows.
• Novel security architecture: The benefits of 6G will
be tremendous, however one of the naive challenges
is how to deploy security and privacy measures in 6G
architecture, which is not defined yet.
• Security in on-demand 6G applications: In the 6G distributed applications, software and hardware will be
decoupled in device to device architectures. Another
important challenge, how to perform security services
(e.g., authentications) when new network elements may
be instantiated on-demand in 6G applications.
• Security and privacy in distributed AI: Due to the fact
that the scale of 6G network will grow unimaginably
high. It is anticipated that 6G will be consisting of
several of decentralized and intelligent systems that
will capable of taking autonomous and savvy decisions
(through distributed AI) at various levels in many of
applications. What security and privacy challenges and
issues are related with such technologies are neither
fully anticipated nor identified yet? Another issue associated with security and privacy is what if AI-based
tools will be used for an attack purpose?
• Security mechanisms in AI Algorithms: It is very likely
that the traditional AI mechanisms may vulnerable to
security attacks. For instance, an attacker may pollute
data during the model training and that may reduce the
performance of an AI algorithm. However, how to detect
such malicious attempts at first place is challenging.
• Privacy mechanisms in AI Algorithms: Privacy in AI
enabled system has its own associated issues, such as
legal, tech, moral and/or ethical challenges. There is a
no guarantee that whether the collected data in AI models will not be exposed to other non-trusted model. Such
non-trusted model may leak information or meta-data
to unauthorized entities. This may lead to the security
breaches. Therefore, AI based algorithms are privacy
alarming situations as of today, with no potential solution that how to design and develop privacy enabled
AI model that will protect the privacy of users while
having the maximum usability of their data.
3) FUTURE WORK
As we progress towards the next decade or so, the 5G
beyond/6G networks will be enabling (x times) faster technologies and services than the current technologies, to across
the end-users, communications, businesses, governments,
and so on. Such faster technologies will also open a huge
attack vector that will bring high risk to societies, businesses,
etc. In addition, the traditional security approaches of 4/5G
may not be enough to secure ever evolving 6G network.
However, the basic requirements, such as confidentiality,
integrity, availability, authenticity that need to be fulfilled
in the future network. Furthermore, privacy-by-design must
be integrated and implemented that would guaranteed fulfill the demands of data privacy, location privacy, identity
privacy and privacy of other meta-data. In summary, the
future researcher must rethink about developing of new or
innovative security and privacy solutions (enabling quantum
computing based mechanisms) with affordable low-cost, and
high security.
IX. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we provide a broad and exhaustive survey on
the current developments of 6G. Societal and technological
trends envisaged by the 2030 society highlight the limitations
of existing 5G mobile networks. Driven by the heterogeneous
demands of the hyper-connected 2030 world, a new network
paradigm is envisioned to facilitate emerging applications.
These applications require 6G networks to provide extreme
data rates, extremely low delays, extreme reliability and
VOLUME 2, 2021
availability, massive scalability, extreme power efficiency,
and extreme mobility. Realizing this 6G vision requires utilizing new technologies that are envisaged to act as enablers
of 6G. We also highlight existing projects, research work,
and standardization approaches focusing on the development
of 6G. Consequently, we consider the lessons learned and
limitations of prevailing research work to propose a roadmap
for future research directions towards 6G.
