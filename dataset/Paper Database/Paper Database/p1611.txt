A major goal of neuroscience is to understand the relationship between neural structures and their function. Recording of
neural activity with arrays of electrodes is a primary tool employed toward this goal. However, the relationships among the
neural activity recorded by these arrays are often highly complex making it problematic to accurately quantify a network’s
structural information and then relate that structure to its function. Current statistical methods including cross correlation
and coherence have achieved only modest success in characterizing the structural connectivity. Over the last decade an
alternative technique known as Granger causality is emerging within neuroscience. This technique, borrowed from the field
of economics, provides a strong mathematical foundation based on linear auto-regression to detect and quantify ‘‘causal’’
relationships among different time series. This paper presents a combination of three Granger based analytical methods
that can quickly provide a relatively complete representation of the causal structure within a neural network. These are a
simple pairwise Granger causality metric, a conditional metric, and a little known computationally inexpensive subtractive
conditional method. Each causal metric is first described and evaluated in a series of biologically plausible neural
simulations. We then demonstrate how Granger causality can detect and quantify changes in the strength of those
relationships during plasticity using 60 channel spike train data from an in vitro cortical network measured on a
microelectrode array. We show that these metrics can not only detect the presence of causal relationships, they also provide
crucial information about the strength and direction of that relationship, particularly when that relationship maybe
changing during plasticity. Although we focus on the analysis of multichannel spike train data the metrics we describe are
applicable to any stationary time series in which causal relationships among multiple measures is desired. These techniques
can be especially useful when the interactions among those measures are highly complex, difficult to untangle, and maybe
changing over time.

Introduction
multichannel
extracellular
techniques have enabled access to the activity of hundreds or
thousands of neurons simultaneously. Because of this and other
technologies, investigators are now addressing one of the primary
challenges in neuroscience. That is, linking measurements of a
network’s structural topology with that of the network’s potential
functions. This effort has been supported in part by a simultaneous
advance in the quality of analytical tools that attempt to quantify
the often highly complex interactions that are observed (e.g., crosscorrelation , coherence , and directed transfer ). Although
methods such as cross-correlation have been useful, they do not
provide one of the key pieces of information investigators desire.
That is, a mathematically sound measure of ‘‘causal’’ relations
within their data, the strength of that relation, and perhaps more
importantly, the direction of that relationship. This is particularly
true of brain activity recorded from a large array of electrodes
where increases in the number of electrodes has resulted in a
combinatorial explosion in the number of potential interactions
that must be evaluated. In contrast, Granger causality (GC) has
emerged in recent years as an alternative analytical method
providing a mathematically rigorous means for estimating the
causal strength of complex relationships among brain areas in vivo
recordings in humans , rats and primates .
This analytical method is also emerging as a tool to assess
structural information changes in the strength of connectivity
during plasticity . It is not clear how changes in the
estimated causal strength between different electrodes relates to
the actual changes in the synaptic weights. Determining this
relationship in vivo would be complicated by both the complexity
and limited access to the entire network. However, these
limitations could be assessed in a more constrained situation such
as within in vitro networks recorded with MEAs. In this
preparation, a small network of approximately 25,000 neurons
from the rat are excised, separated, and placed onto the surface of
a small grid of electrodes less than 2 mm in diameter . An
example of one of these arrays is shown in Figure 1. Neurons on
these arrays rapidly reconnect forming a spontaneously active
living network whose electrophysiological activity can be measured
continuously with a MEA for hours, days, and even months at a
time . This preparation offers the same multichannel

access to neural activity as in vivo, but in a smaller network where
complex interactions may be more easily assessed to characterize
the accuracy of GC or its ability to measure plasticity.
In this paper we will focus on analytical techniques based on
Granger causality that address some of its limitations. Although
the metrics described in this paper apply to virtually any
multivariate recording, our description and analysis will be in
the context of spike train data generated from simulated networks
to illustrate the limitations and solutions followed by an application
to a living network of cortical neurons on an MEA. The overall
objective of this paper is to 1) describe the mathematical concepts
behind Granger causality, 2) define, simulate, and characterize
network topologies that can distort estimates of the structure and
strength of causal interactions and provide solutions, and 3)
demonstrate the application of this technique as a potentially
powerful tool to resolve complex changes in plasticity measured
with an MEA in an in vitro cortical network.
We begin with a description of the mathematical foundation of
Granger causality for determining the causal strength of pairwise
relationships (e.g., the strength of A causing changes in B or
conversely, B driving changes in A). The pairwise technique alone
can be quite useful to unravel any interdependencies in a network
and outline its structure. However, this technique encounters
significant limitations in more complex networks where the
relationship between a pair of neurons (or electrodes) can be
mediated by other elements, which is a much more common
scenario. A conditional Granger causality (CGC) metric is then
described that can overcome some of those limitations and a
computational method is also provided to accelerate this analysis.
By combining each of these methods to estimate the actual or
direct causal relationships or Direct Granger causality (DGC), we
can successfully uncover complex relationships among individual
neurons. These methods are first applied to simple neural
simulations to test their ability to recover the synaptic weights
embedded within a network of five neurons. Each simulation
embodies various structural relationships that might be encountered and the problems that appear in estimating a network’s
structural information from spike trains. The accuracy of DGC
will then be assessed in a large-scale complex network composed of
100 biologically plausible neurons. Finally, we examine how this
combination of techniques may provide a superior measure for
describing plasticity related changes in connectivity within a living
network of cultured cortical neurons.
Autoregressive Modeling
We begin by providing a brief description of autoregressive
modeling (AR) which represents the foundation of Granger
causality methods. Time series in multivariate neural data are
typically recorded from multiple electrodes and may include
multiple trials of data. While AR models are often presented in a
theoretical context, the examples reported here are provided in the
context of a typical multichannel recording of action potentials
(spikes) from a neural process either in vivo, or in vitro. However,
this description would also apply to the analysis of field potentials,
membrane potentials, etc. Consider the multivariate random
process, X(t), consisting of p independent electrodes:
A recording of a time series from these electrodes would be
considered a single realization of this neural process. Multiple
realizations of the neural process (e.g., trials) are often advantageous to creating a more accurate model describing this process

(see Ding et al. for an example). Although raw voltage time
series data can be used directly, discrete spike train data can be
transformed to a time series which has the advantage of removing
any nonstationarities and reducing noise. A digital filter can then
be applied to limit the range of potential interactions one wishes to
study. The multichannel time series X(t) is described using an mth
order AR equation assuming that X(t) is a stationary process.

A(i) is a p by p coefficient matrix where i = 1,2,…,m and E(t) is a
zero mean uncorrelated noise vector with a covariance matrix of
S. Since A(i) and S are unknown they must be estimated from the
realizations of X(t). This is accomplished by multiplying Equation 2

of the A(i) coefficient matrix can be solved for because there are
mp2 equations within Equation 3. There are several methods that
can be used to solve this matrix including simply solving for each
of these coefficients or using methods such as the Levinson,
Wiggins, and Robertson’s method or Morf’s method , used for
this analysis. Alternatively S may be obtain by the following
A ið ÞR ið Þ
This method can be used to estimate the multivariate AR model
for any model order m. An efficient model order can be
determined using several methods including the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC). The BIC is more often used for neural applications as it
compensates for the large N (number of data points) common to
neural data sets. Thus, the BIC will be the primary method used to
determine model order in these studies.

The BIC can then be plotted as a function of the model order m.
The correct model order usually corresponds to a minimization of
BIC. However, when the model order becomes too large this may
result in excessive computation time. Often, a smaller model order
with a similarly minimized value of BIC is used rather than the
absolute minimum BIC for this reason. The final step is to
determine whether this AR model is an adequate representation of
the data set by determining whether the residual noise is white. To
do this the difference between the actual values and the model’s
prediction of those values is calculated and compared to a white
noise distribution . The resulting time domain AR model will
be the basis for the calculation of both time and spectral domain
granger causality, that will be discussed in the following section.
For the following spike train analysis a model order of 8
(corresponding to 8 ms) was chosen as higher orders added little
additional information.
Granger Causality
Pairwise Granger causality (PGC) was initially developed by the
economics community to describe and quantify the ‘‘causal
relationship’’ between data from two different economic time
series. The concept of Granger causality has played a significant
role in the field of economics since 1960s. The foundation for
Granger’s analysis can be traced back to Wiener who
proposed that for any two simultaneously recorded time series, one
series could be called causal to another if incorporating past
knowledge of the first time series permits more accurate prediction
of the second series. Granger formalized this idea in the context of
linear regression models of stochastic processes . Specifically,
consider two simultaneously recorded time series x1, x2, x3… xn
and y1, y2, y3… yn. Suppose one would like to construct a linear
predictor of the current value of the x series based on m prior
values: xn = a1xn21+a2xn22+…+amxn2m+en. More formally they are
individually represented as:
S1~var e tð Þ
for x and y as:
C1~var g tð Þ
This is nothing more than a single variable autoregressive (AR)
model in which standard procedures can be applied to yield the
model order m and model coefficients aj and bj, where the variance
S1 and C2, of the error series, en, and gn, are a gauge of the
prediction accuracy.
Bivariate Case
Now consider a joint predictor of the current values of the x
series by including both the previous values of the x series and the
previous values of the y series, namely:
and the covariance matrix S is:
Causal Measures
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org
October 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 10 | e3355
This is the multivariate AR model where the procedures
described in the previous section can be used to calculate the
model coefficients aj and an efficient model order m. The value of
S1 from Equation 8 is the estimate of the accuracy of the
autoregression for the x series based on prior values, while S2
represents the accuracy of predicting X based on both the X and Y
time series. Based on Wiener’s idea, Granger formulated that if S2
is less than S1 in some suitable statistical sense (i.e. the prediction
of x is improved by incorporating past knowledge of y), then we
can say that the y series has a causal influence on the x series. This
relationship can be quantified by the log ratio of these two values:
Fy?x~ln S1
If X and Y are independent, then S1 = S2, C1 = C2, the
covariance, U2, is zero, axy and ayx would be uniformly zero, and
the resultant causal influence of y upon x, FyRx would be zero.
However, FyRx would be greater than zero if there were a causal
influence from Y upon X. Similarly the causal influence of X upon
Y would be:
Fx?y~ln C1
Any interactions between each series not explained by the above
(e.g., possible exogenous driving influences that may act upon both
series) is defined by:
FX.Y~ln S2C2
where |.| is the determinant of the enclosed matrix and represents
the ‘‘instantaneous’’ causality. The total interdependence of each
series is then:
FX,Y~ln S1C1
where FX,Y = FXRY+FYRX+FXNY. Hence we can decompose the total
interdependence between the x and y time series into its three
components: the causality from X upon Y, the causality from Y upon
X, and the instantaneous causality representing any mutual
exogenous driving input into both. With these set of equations we
can determine the pairwise causal relation (i.e., pairwise Granger
causality), between data from any combination of electrodes or
times series. Natural time series, including ones from neurobiology,
often contain oscillatory aspects in specific frequency bands,
however. For this application a spectral representation of Granger
causality developed by Geweke and others is available that
allows casual interactions to be quantified at specific frequencies.
The calculations for the spectral version are, however, very similar
to the formulation and are therefore not repeated here.
Significant Limitations of Pairwise Granger Causality
In a simple two-neuron network in which neuron X is
connected with one or more synapses to Z, pairwise Granger
causality can easily discriminate a direct causal relationship from
X to Z and determine the direction of that relationship. In this
case the value produced by PGC would be directly related to the
overall synaptic efficacy (coupling) of X to Z. However, the
accuracy of the pairwise approach encounters methodological
limitations in more complex networks where direct, mediated, and
serial influences exist between these neurons. These influences will
confound estimates of the actual synaptic efficacy and lead to
erroneous conclusions. For example, consider a case of threeneurons in which neuron X is coupled via a synapse to a mediating
neuron, Y, who is then connected to a third neuron, Z, illustrated
in panel (a) of Figure 2. A Granger causality analysis between each
pair would correctly identify the relationship between X and Y,
and Y to Z. However, it would also identify an erroneous causal
connection between X and Z illustrated in panel (b), even though
this pair is not directly coupled. The reason for this is that the
activity of X does in fact causally influence the activity of Z, but
does so only through a mediating relationship through Y.
Second, the serial relationship that cascades from X to Y and Z
produces an estimate of causal influence of X upon Z via Y that
will erroneously contribute to the estimated strength of the
pairwise estimate of Y upon Z. In other words, the values of PGC
from Y to Z are now distorted by X and no longer a true reflection
of their true causal strength nor their actual synaptic weight. Of
course this problem may become acute in more complex networks
with many interacting neurons or brain areas where these
relationships may be commonplace. In the following sections,
several techniques are described to address these problems.
Conditional Granger Causality
Any highly multivariate data can be analyzed by PGC by reducing
the problem to a number of simple bivariate (pairwise) cases. In fact,
this approach is often the most straightforward and can be an
effective method for analyzing causal relations within simple systems.
As we have shown earlier however, this simple pairwise methodology
can sometimes yield distorted results especially in more complex
systems. Conditional Granger causality (CGC) is an
alternative technique that can be used to identify and conditionally
remove erroneous direct connections that are actually mediated
though other neurons. In this procedure described by Geweke ,
the causal relationship between X and Z is now made conditional on
Y. The trivariate AR model for X, Y, and Z is defined by:
Figure 2. Conditional Pairwise Granger Causality In a Three
Neuron Network. If pairwise Granger causality were applied to
determine the connectivity of both of these network configurations the
results for both would resemble panel a). Using pairwise Granger
causality alone, it is not possible to differentiate between these network
configurations. Conditional Granger causality is needed to determine if
the connection from X to Z is real or mediated through Y by
determining how well Z can be predicted by X with versus without the
inclusion of Y.

Causal Measures
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org
October 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 10 | e3355
The time domain formulation of CGC compares the variance of
the estimation of Z including X shown earlier in Equation 10 and
11 (where Z is substituted for X and X is substituted for Y), with
the prediction of Z including X and Y in Equation 17 below.
The influence of X on Z is entirely mediated through Y when
the prediction of z is not improved in the trivariate over the
bivariate model. Specifically, CGC is calculated by taking the log
of the ratio of the variance of the prediction error of Z from the
bivariate example in Equation 11 (where Z is substituted for X,
and X is substituted for Y in Equation 10) over the variance of the
prediction error of Z in Equation 17 defined as:
Conditional Granger causality calculated using this equation is
greater than zero when some of the power from Y is directly causal
on Z. The result would be equal to zero when the influence of X on
Z is entirely mediated through Y. Thus, this method allows the two
examples stated earlier to be easily differentiable. This method is,
however, computationally expensive and may be impractical with
very large electrode arrays due to the combinatorial number
combinations that must be addressed. Interestingly, Geweke also
noted that it might be possible to directly subtract the PGC
calculated from Y to Z from the PGC value from X to Z when the
influence from X to Z is entirely mediated through Y. This recovers
the same quantity as calculating CGC from X to Z conditional on
Y, without having to perform the computationally intensive CGC
analysis. This concept will be evaluated empirically later.
Remaining Limitations
Finally, while conditional Granger causality addresses some
specific deficiencies in the original formulation, there remains
several further weaknesses that need to be considered when
drawing any conclusions. First, the time scale and the sampling
rate are two variables that can have a intertwined yet diametrically
opposed effects on a causal analysis. Selection of a time scale and
sampling rate is highly dependent on the processes being observed.
If the sampling rate is too low, it can be difficult to observe time
delayed influences in the system because the system may be
interacting at time scales of a higher frequency than the sampling
rate. Conversely, if the sampling rate is too high it can be
computationally intractable to model far enough into the future
(i.e. high model order m) to capture interactions. Additionally, it is
possible that two time series may interact differently on two largely
different time scales which would then require separate analysis.
Perhaps a more fundamental problem when analyzing neural
systems is Granger’s inability to detect the presence of inhibitory,
rather than excitatory, contributions. Inhibitory synapses, unlike
their excitatory counterparts, decrease activity in their targets. In
other words, activity of these inhibitory neurons upon a target
would result in a reduction in the causal influence measured
between other neurons and this target. In a Granger causality
analysis the presence of this inhibitory relationship would be
indistinguishable
relationships
influence is present. Hence, the presence of activity by these
inhibitory neurons will likely lead to distorted causal influences
among other neuron pairs even though the actual causal influence
may be strong. In the future it may be possible to untangle these
inhibitory influences with, for example, the addition of conditional
logic to identify occasions where this might be a problem and
remove the contribution of these neurons.
It is also not possible to describe all variables in a typical
experimental system. Consequently, unobserved time series from
these variables are a factor that must always be considered when
examining causal influences. Implementation and subsequent
interpretation of Granger causality inherently depends on the
availability and selection of variables for analysis. For example, if
the causal relationship between two neurons is influenced by a
third that is not measured (e.g., a neuron too distant from an
electrode) Granger causality would indicate the presence of a
direct causal influence where none truly exists. This is the so called
‘‘hidden unit’’ problem and is a limitation of virtually all analytical
methods. Moreover, the likelihood of this situation increases with
the complexity of the system being observed. The magnitude of
this problem, however, will be dependent on the strength of the
causal influence from those hidden units. Relatively weak
influences should only marginally distort any relationships while
strong causal influences will likely have a profound affect on
causality estimates. This is an important but highly complex
problem in any modest sized network whose analysis is beyond the
scope of this paper (please see for a discussion of this
problem and potential solutions).
Results and Discussion
Analysis of Common Network Topologies
In this section, we illustrate the analytical solutions described
earlier within a simple, biologically plausible neural network
model. We have chosen Izhikevich’s simple neuron model 
a stochastically driven neural network with modifiable synaptic
weighting that provides biologically relevant spikes that can then
be analyzed using GC. Briefly, the model is a reduction of a
Hodgkin-Huxley neuron to a simple two-dimensional system
of differential equations. Equation 19 models the membrane
voltage, v, while the second (Equation 20) models a recovery
variable, u.

variables a, b, c, and d are dimensionless parameters that effect the
temporal characteristics of the action potential, while v9 and u9 are
the first order derivatives of v and u. These variables remain
constant and are the default values used by Izhikevich for regular
spiking cortical neurons . Each time-step of the model
represents 1 ms, equivalent to a 1 kHz sampling rate of a realistic
neural system. During simulation, neurons can spontaneously fire
based on a stochastic super-threshold fluctuations of membrane
noise injected into each neuron and from synaptic inputs from
other neurons in the network.
Simple Mono-Directional Case.
The first model, illustrated
in Figure 3, consisted of a five-neuron network composed of monodirectional connectivity (i.e., one way singular direction for causal
relations) from Neuron 4 (N4) to 5 (N5) and from Neuron 2 (N2) to
Neuron 1 (N1), with neighboring Neuron 3 (N3) uncoupled (zero
synaptic weight). Hence, the activity of N2 and N4 will have a
causal influence on firing of N1 and N5, respectively. In contrast,
N3 is driven by only its intrinsic random noise which is present, but
independent across neurons. A simple pairwise analysis (PGC)
detected the strong causal relationship for N1 to N2 (PGC = 0.53)
and N4 to N5 (PGC = 1.0) relative to N3 and its neighbors
(PGC,0.1). In contrast, causality within the reverse relationship,
N5 to N4, was near zero and verifies the absence of a bi-directional
relationship between the pair. Similar results using other modeling
systems can be found elsewhere .
Synaptic Weight and Granger Causality.
In the previous
example PGC was shown to successfully capture the causal
relationships between two pairs of neurons and determine the
direction of that relationship. The strength of those relationships
are reflected in the magnitude of the PGC values returned.
Although PGC values are correlated with synaptic strength, it is
not clear what the actual relationship might be (e.g., a simple
linear relationship or more complex nonlinear relationship). In
other words, how is the estimate of causality using PGC related to
the actual underlying synaptic weight?
To determine the relationship between synaptic weight and
causal strength between neuron pairs, the synaptic weight between
N1 and N2 was systematically incremented from 0 mV to 75 mV
and the resultant effect on PGC’s estimate of causality was
observed. One hundred instantiations of the model were simulated
for each level of synaptic weight and the average estimate by PGC
and variance of that estimate was calculated. The results of those
simulations, shown in Figure 4, indicate that PGC values are not
linearly related to synaptic weight. In fact, a sigmoid relationship
appears between the synaptic weight from N1 to N2 (S1R2) and
resultant GC, F1R2. There is a region however between 15 mV
and 45 mV where the relationship between S1R2 and F1R2
becomes linear with a slope of 0.033 causal units/mV. Synaptic
weights above this range do not produce significant changes on
F1R2, suggesting that a weight of 45 mV is the point where this
effect is saturated. Similarly, weights below 15 mV produce
negligible changes in causality estimates using PGC. In other
words, this suggests that Granger’s estimate will be distorted if the
underlying synaptic weights are exceedingly large or very small. A
similar nonlinear relationship has been shown between the relative
contribution of synaptic weights within small sub-networks to
macro network behavior .
To enable the extraction of synaptic weights from PGC values
the results in Figure 4 were fit with a sigmoid, shown in
Equation 22, to quantify the functional relationship between
Granger estimates and actual synaptic weights and compensate for
this problem. We apply this relationship later to recover synaptic
weights within random network topologies. First however, we need
to address methods to compensate for the systematic errors that
resulting from the presence of mediating relationships.

simple neuron model with these weights yields the results shown in

that pairwise Granger causality can not only resolve the difference
between null and actual connectivity, but also determine the
directionality of those influences.

described by Equation 12. Notice that only the region in which the
synaptic weights are between 15 mV and 45 mV is linearly related with
the magnitude of the causality estimate. Areas in which the synaptic
weights are very small or very large will result in a distorted causality
value that changes very little.

Relationships
Serial Connectivity.
PGC works well for recovering synaptic
weights between two neurons using Equation 22. However, due to
added complexity within the network, there are situations where
PGC values will not adhere to this relationship. Often PGC values
include not only the direct information between neurons but also
include mediated influences described earlier that could distort the
relationship between PGC’s estimate and actual synaptic weights.
This issue could become critical as the number of neurons or
network complexity increases.
This issue is addressed in a second simulation, where a serial
topology was created to demonstrate separation and recovery of
individual synaptic weights. The five-neuron topology, shown in
Figure 5 panel (a), consisted of causal synaptic weights of 15 mV
from N1 through N5 similar to a synfire chain . The
original PGC estimate of causality, shown in panel (b), indicates
erroneous connections among the entire pool of neurons reflecting
the complex causal relationships between each element. Table 1
shows the PGC results for each relationship. Note also that the
PGC values, shown along the elements of the serial chain, steadily
increase from N1 to N5 (diagonal in Table 1), reflecting the
embedded mediated causal influences cascading along the chain.
Application of Conditional Granger Causality.
applied to discriminate false direct from mediated connections in
order to determine the network’s true connectivity. Panel (c) of
Figure 5 shows the results of CGC, where the topology has been
correctly estimated but includes the systematic errors in estimating
the strength of coupling. The problem arises because the values
remaining after calculating CGC represent a combination of direct
and mediated influences which accumulate towards the end of the
chain. Thus, the direct components between any two neurons
must be separated from mediated influences to relate the direct
component to a meaningful synaptic weight.
Recovery of direct synaptic weights can be achieved using CGC
for a second time on the mediated pathway. However, a simpler
solution exists. If PGC sums the effects of previous elements along
a serially connected chain, then it may be possible to simply
subtract the previous influences. This would essentially condition
out the contribution of false direct influences that represent the
mediated component of the distorted PGC value. For example, by
subtracting N1R3 (0.55) from N2R3 (1.37), a value of 0.82 is
obtained, which better estimates the actual synaptic weights

This allows for the derivation of Equation 25, which describes
the empirical relationship that allows subtraction of PGC values to

A direct comparison of the accuracy of these methods for
calculating DGC was investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation
of a 3-neuron chain. One hundred realizations of this simulation
were created and both methods were used to recover DGC from
the PGC output of the synapse at the end of the chain. The
synaptic weights for each realization of the simulation were
randomly generated between 15 mV and 45 mV. Figure 6 plots
the Granger estimate for each synaptic weight produced by the
difference method versus CGC for each realization. Overall, both
methods produce similar estimates of the actual synaptic weight.
This supports the idea that the difference method presented in
Equation 23 can produce DGC values similar to that of CGC as
shown in Equation 18.
Simulations
A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to further
test DGC in a 5-neuron serial chain with random synaptic weights.
This experiment was designed to assess the accuracy of the
relationship between synaptic weights and the recovered DGC for
each synapse in the serial chain. The synaptic weights S1R2, S2R3,
S3R4, and S4R5 were randomly generated for each of the 100
realizations assessed using a uniform distribution from the 15 mV
to 45 mV linear range of the sigmoid relationship derived from the
first experiment. The DGC for pathways with mediated influences
(F2R3, F3R4, & F4R5) was calculated for each synapse using the
difference method by subtracting the conditioned F(N-1)M pathway
from FNRM and retained. The synaptic weights S1R2 and F1R2
were also retained to serve as a baseline for comparison. Monte
Carlo distributions for the DGC pathways should mirror the
relationship between S1R2 and F1R2, a purely direct pathway.
Figure 7 shows that the distributions for the DGC at each
synapse from N1 to N4 which mirror the linear distribution from
the purely direct S1R2 to F1R2. The higher variance for the DGC
farther down the chain (e.g., upper left vs. lower right panel) is due
to additive error from the way DGC is calculated. This empirical
relationship shows that the conditioned pathway, F(N21)M, is a
reasonable representation of the mediated component of the
remaining pathway, FNRM. The empirical relationship also
suggests that DGC is an accurate representation of the direct
component between two neurons and can be used to calculate a
meaningful synaptic weight using the relationship described earlier
in Equation 22. This simple method which may be useful for
processing serial chains also has significant limitations when
networks become more complex. For example, the presence of
significant additional interacting connections among the five or
from outside influences can significantly impact the accuracy of
this assessment and requiring conditional Granger causality to

over an MEA, shown earlier in Figure 1, over 25,000 neurons may
be present spanning over 2 mm in diameter. These so called
‘‘random’’ networks are therefore very complex containing
direct, mediated, and serial connectivity patterns among neurons.
Neurons within these networks are spontaneously active producing
semi-periodic bursts of activity observed in neurons from virtually
every brain area and the nervous system including cortical
 , hippocampus , spinal cord retina
 and in seizure like activity in acute hippocampal and
cortical slice .
Neural Simulation.
In this section we first create a more
complex neural simulation composed of 100 neurons in a random
network topology. We then assess the ability of Granger causality
to successfully detect the structural information from a small subset
of these neurons. This simulation consisted of 80 excitatory and 20
inhibitory neurons with 20,000 synapses mimicking the proportion
known to exist within these cultures and would exhibit
spontaneous network wide bursts of activity. Excitatory neurons
are connected to all other neurons using randomly generated
weights from an exponential distribution where most connections
are weak (1–4 mV) while strong connections (up to 70 mV) are
sparse. Inhibitory neurons are connected to the network using a
flat distribution of synaptic weights ranging from 21 to 210 mV.
Five excitatory neurons embedded within the network were
chosen mimicking the sparse recording capabilities of the MEA
and the synaptic weights were set at 40 mV to mimic a serial chain
topology. Hence, each receives input from each preceding
member of the chain in addition to inputs from all other
neurons in the network. An example of the complex topology
for one realization of this network is shown in panel (a) of Figure 8.
Each point represents a neuron with its associated connectivity to
its neighbors denoted with grey lines. The five neurons embedded
within this network that will be assessed are highlighted in red and
the serial chain is also highlighted, among any other potential
mediated and direct connections (highlighted as blue lines) among
Accuracy of Pairwise Granger Causality.
This artificial
network, like its in vitro cousin, is spontaneously active producing
both isolated spiking and oscillatory bursting shown in the raster
plot of spiking activity in panel b) of Figure 8. Pairwise Granger
causality was then used as a measure of the relationship between
these 5 neurons and the resultant PGC values are shown in panel
(c). High causal relations (PGC values near 1.0) are indicated in
red while non-causal relations are shown in blue (PGC near zero).
In each case PGC successfully captured the serial relationship
between 1–2, 2–3, 3–4, and 4–5 where information flows
directionally down the chain. In addition, PGC successfully
discriminated the directionality of those connections. While there
were significant causal influences from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4
to 5, there was no evidence of reciprocal relationships flowing in
the opposite direction. However, the results of this pairwise
analysis also reflect the limitations of PGC with the appearance of
both mediated and serial influences, indicated by the nonzero
causal influences between 1 and 3, 4, 5, and 2–4,5, and the serial
increase in causal strength along the chain. Although the serial
increase could be compensated by application of the DGC method
Figure 7. DGC values can be recovered at each of the synapses in the serial chain. Random synaptic weights of 15 mV and 45 mV were
generated between each neuron in a five-neuron serial chain and 100 realizations of this chain were created for analysis. These plots demonstrate
that DGC values recovered from entangled pathways (top right, bottom right, and bottom left) along the serial chain mirror those calculated using
PGC on the first pathway (top left). This suggests that DGC values represent the direct influence between two neurons similar to the PGC relationship
that can be calculated between neurons that are not entangled by mediated influences.

conditional Granger causality analysis.
Accuracy of Conditional Granger Causality.
Conditional
Granger causality was then applied to the spike train data from the
five neurons highlighted in red in Figure 8 to identify and remove
any spurious connections suggested by the PGC analysis. The
resultant and now correct serial structure revealed by CGC is
shown in panel (d) of Figure 8. Thus, Granger causality effectively
recovers the serial chain embedded within this 100-neuron
simulation. The sigmoid relationship between causality and
synaptic weights described previously in Figure 4 was then used
to estimate and recover the synaptic weights. The transformed
causality values, also shown in panel (d), are very similar to the
actual strength (40 mV) between each of the five neurons. Of
course the results from this 100-neuron network are not as
accurate as the results shown previously within simpler networks.
This likely reflects the effects of the many hidden units not
included in our analysis that also influenced the activity of these
five neurons. However, this technique does provide a reasonable
estimate of the actual connectivity in a small network whose
structure is similar to that of its cultured counterparts.
Granger Causality as a Method to Estimate Plasticity
In most living networks the strength of connectivity, plasticity, is
constantly changing. This is especially true of learning paradigms,
for example in vivo, where auditory or visual stimuli are presented
to the subject and the researcher wishes to measure how those
stimuli affect the causal interactions within an underlying structure
 . Perhaps the simplest method when data from
individual neurons are available is based on changes in firing rate
before and after a stimulus is presented. For example, Jimbo et al.
 measured the plasticity induced across a network of cortical
neurons by rapidly stimulating a single location with a tetanic
pulse train (20 Hz stimulation) using an MEA similar to the one
shown earlier in Figure 1. To estimate the location and degree of
plasticity the network was systematically probed with a brief
electrical stimulation delivered sequentially to each of the 60
locations on the 868 electrode grid before and after the tetanus.
The core notion behind this technique is that any changes in the
underlying strength of connectivity within the network will result
in a change in the number of spikes recorded on one or more of
the electrodes of the MEA. Jimbo found that stimulating just one
of the 60 electrodes with the tetanic pulse train resulted in complex
changes in the strength of the underlying connectivity in which
both enhancement and depression of synaptic strength were
Unfortunately, employing a change in firing rates as a measure
of plasticity can often be prone to a number of methodological
problems. For example, neural activity is often very noisy
requiring many trials or long trial durations to establish a reliable
measure. Further, changes in firing rate alone could be due to nonplasticity related processes such as the spontaneous fluctuations in
overall activity that are common in these cultures. Surprisingly,
Granger causality has only recently begun to receive attention as
an alternative measure of plasticity (e.g., ). There are
several potential advantages of using Granger causality analysis as
a measure of plasticity. First, Granger causality provides a strong
mathematical foundation that is relatively immune to spontaneous
fluctuations in firing rate. Second, unlike changes in spike rate it
also provides a way to determine the directional influence among
the neurons (i.e., who is causing who to fire). Third, the strength of
any causal relationships can be quantified without the need to

5 neurons (shown in red) is embedded within a larger network of 100 neurons connected in an all-to-all fashion (grey lines where only a fraction of
the total connections are shown for clarity). The goal of this simulation is to extract the causal core shown in panel A using Granger Methods. Each
synaptic weight in the chain is is set at 40 mV. Panel (B) shows the activity of these five neurons within the full network. Panel (C) shows the results
from only PGC analysis in which the causal serial relationship can be seen along the diagonal. Panel (D) shows the remaining significant connectivity
after CGC analysis and their corresponding synaptic weights. Note that the weights down the chain are significantly underestimated, this is likely due
to the influence of the rest of the network on recovered weights.

perturb the network (i.e., inducing plasticity to measure a change
indicative of a pathway). Finally, GC analysis often requires less
data to perform its calculations (e.g., fewer trials, or shorter
recording durations). Hence, GC may be a more sensitive and
perhaps a more reliable estimate of plasticity relative to other
In this experiment, rat cortical neurons were cultured over a 60
electrode MEA electrode grid shown earlier in Figure 1. Each
electrode on the array was probed sequentially at (1 Hz) with a
stimulation
(+/2600 mV,
randomized order for a total of 10 probes per electrode. Each
probe produces a short 100–200 ms burst of activity across the
network measured by the array. The average firing rate was then
calculated individually for each electrode by probe location
producing a 60660 matrix of firing rates (i.e., probe electrode6response electrode). A tetanic pulse train was then delivered to one
of the 60 electrodes on the array to induce plasticity. This train
consisted of 20 blocks of 11 stimulation pulses (+/2600 mV/
200 us, 50 ms between each pulse) to induce plasticity across the
network. Each of the 60 electrodes were then probed again and
the difference between firing rates before and after the tetanus
were calculated for each probe location and each electrode. Any
changes in plasticity among the neurons in this network should
result in either an increase (enhancement) or decrease (depression)
in firing rates representing long-term potentiation (LTP) or
depression (LTD), respectively.
Preprocessing of Spike-Train Data.
For the following GC
analysis, spike trains containing spike time information were
collected for 200 ms after each probe for each electrode and for
each stimulus location (36,000 200 ms spike trains representing the
response from 60 electrodes610 probes per electrode660 probe
locations). Each 200 ms spike train was converted to a continuous
time series appropriate for Granger causality analysis by binning
the time of each spike into 1 ms bins and low-pass filtering
(200 Hz) so that GC’s results could be compared with the slower
firing rate based measure. The stationarity of the resulting
continuous signal for each segment was then adjusted by
subtracting the mean of each 200 ms segment and dividing by
its’ standard deviation . This adjustment is necessary since the
Granger causality metric depends on the assumption of covariance
stationarity. A pairwise Granger causality analysis (PGC) was
conducted separately for each probe location and among each
electrode pair. For the following correlation results outliers were
removed before calculation.

spike rate following the tetanus or decrease (blue colors). The

electrode resulted both enhancement and depression of spike rate
activity whose direction was dependent on the stimulus location
producing increased spike rates near the tetanic site (upper left

seen in all subjects. Overall, the trend for all subjects was a slight
negative skew in the distributions of the change in spike rate (lower

The plot in the lower left quadrant breaks changes in spike rate
down by probe electrode to illustrate one of the primary results
reported by Jimbo et al. That is, pathway-specific plasticity in
Figure 9. Comparison of Firing Rate and Pairwise Granger Causality Plasticity Measures. The neural activity of rat cortical neurons were
stimulated to induce plasticity and recorded using an 868 grid of MEA electrodes (shown earlier in Figure 1). The left, middle, and right panel
represent plasticity suggested by changes (enhancement or depression) in firing rate, pairwise Granger causality for outgoing ‘‘source’’ and incoming
‘‘sink’’ relationships, respectively. Each panel presents in clockwise order the distribution of values, average total changes by spatial location,
distribution of the direction of change, and changes by probe location for each of the three measures. The vertical axis represents the stimulation
probe site among the 60 electrodes on the MEA. The horizontal axis represents the network’s response at each electrode to each probe. Each pixel is
color coded to indicate the magnitude and direction of any changes that occurred following the tetanus. Application of the tetanus resulted in
substantial changes in the strength of connections among neurons in this network. Comparison of those changes using a firing rate based verses a
Granger causality based measure indicates a great deal of similarity between each measure. Rows where spike rate was enhanced in left panel also
tended show a stronger causal relationship in the right panel. Similarly, rows indicating depression were associated with depressed causal strength in
the right panel. A black arrow along the vertical and horizontal axis denote the electrode that received the tetanizing stimulus to induce plasticity.

which the direction of plasticity measured by each probe was
dependent on the location of those probes (stimulation site) across
the network. In this plot probe location is along the vertical axis
and the resultant average response across trials to those probes is
plotted along the horizontal axis for each of the 60 electrodes. The
order of the electrodes are presented serially beginning from the
upper left corner of the MEA (electrode CR 21) clockwise to the
lower right (CR 87) to partially maintain spatial coherence. The
tetanized electrode is indicated by the black arrow on the vertical
and horizontal axis. Similar to Jimbo’s results, the direction of
plasticity varied by probe location, appearing as horizontal strips
of red or blue corresponding to enhancement or depression,
respectively. These effects are thought to represent pathwayspecific changes in which each probe location preferentially elicits
a particular pathway within the network resulting in the consistent
effect across electrodes (horizontal strip). The effect is not,
however, specific to particular neurons/electrode locations since
both enhancement and depression are observed at each stimulus
location (vertical axis).
Pairwise Granger Causality.
The results of the firing rate
analysis were then compared with those based on pairwise
Granger causality. If PGC accurately measures plasticity similar
to firing rate, then the pattern of enhancement and depression
should be similar to that derived from firing rate. The right two
panels of Figure 9 depict PGC’s estimate of plasticity. One
advantage of a PGC analysis is that it can provide information
about the strength and direction and of any causal relationships
permitting a more detailed analysis. Like the firing rate plot in the
left panel, the upper right plots of the right two panels depict the
total change in causality spatially in the 868 electrode grid.
However, the results of PGC are now separated into the direction
information about any changes in causality in terms of outgoing
causal strength (‘‘source relationship’’) for each location in the
network. In other words, it is a measure of the causal strength of
each location upon other areas of the network. Conversely the
right panel depicts changes in causal strength in terms of incoming
relationships (i.e., the average causal strength of other areas
driving activity at this location or ‘‘causal sink’’). Like firing rate
the total outgoing causal strength increased for electrodes near the
tetanic stimulation site but tended to decrease further away from
this location. Unlike firing rate, however, PGC results for the
‘‘incoming’’ sink relationship indicated that this increase was also
associated with a decrease in the overall strength of connections
coming into the area near the tetanic site and an increase in some
areas outside this region.
These differences may reflect the effects of preferentially
stimulating pathways during the tetanic pulse train in which
action potentials evoked near this location are followed by a burst
of activity in the rest of the network leading to spike-timing
dependent LTP (e.g., ). An explanation of the effects in the
opposite ‘‘sink’’ direction are not as clear. The depression observed
within areas near the tetanic site may reflect the effects of an
opposite spike timing relationship. During the tetanus the spike
timing relationships of outside areas is perhaps more likely to be
one in which tetanus fires before the pre-synaptic neuron (i.e., postsynaptic -. pre-synaptic) leading to depressed synapses near the
tetanized electrode. In contrast, increased joint pre-post synaptic
pairings may be more likely outside the tetanic area strengthening
connections
probabilistic and complex varying by the relative strength of
pathways originating within those outside areas and might explain
why the correlation was also lower in the sink compared to the
source measure for all subjects. Of course, without information
concerning the actual structure of the network these notions are
difficult to validate. These results are not, however, due to a
sensitivity of the PGC measure to changes in firing rate alone. In a
separate analysis (not shown) a surrogate data set was created in
which firing rates for each probe location, trial, and response
location were maintained but the timing of spikes within each
electrode were randomized. A PGC analysis of this data resulted in
no change in causality being observed (i.e., a completely green
field for Figure 9). These results do, however, highlight the
enhanced capabilities of Granger causality to unravel very
complex relationships among a modest size electrode array and
are consistent with a traditional measure of plasticity based on
firing rate.
The results of the PGC analysis by probe location also were
consistent with those of firing rate producing horizontal strips
representing pathway-specific effects. However, unlike the spike
rate analysis there are a number of gaps within each horizontal
strip. These gaps likely reflect the discriminatory nature of
Granger causality to distinguish between causal changes from
those due to simple increased or decreased rates. For a PGC
analysis a simple increase in firing rate must correspond to a
increase in the driving influence between two spike trains to be
causal. A simple increase in spike rates whose activity is between
the two spike trains is uncorrelated may not result larger causal
values. Hence it is possible that an increase in firing rate may
sometimes result in a decrease in causality estimates and vice
versa. To quantify the similarity between the spike rate analysis in
the left panel and PGC in the right panels the correlation between
the changes in spike rate versus PGC sink, and rate versus PGC
source were calculated. It is expected that these correlation
coefficients would not be extremely high due to the discriminatory
nature of PGC but should none the less be significant.

correlated with spike rate for MEA culture whose data is shown
in Figure 9 (Pearson r = .269, p,0.001, df = 3412) and for all
MEA cultures (mean = 0.269, range 0.113 to 0.348, p,0.001,
n = 8). For the sink measure the correlation was also significant but
lower than the source measure (r = 0.246, p,0.001, df = 3426) and
for 6 of the 7 remaining subjects (Mean = 0.157, Range 0.089 to
0.29, p,0.001, n = 5; r = 0.049, p,0.05, n = 1). The correlation
for one subject was not significant (r = 0.016, p.1).
Conditional
compared the pattern of plasticity suggested by PGC with a
conditional Granger causality (CGC) analysis. The purpose of this
analysis is to refine PGC’s representation of plasticity by removing
erroneous mediating influences discussed earlier. This analysis was
conducted over the entire 868 array but omitted electrodes along
(calculated
computationally intractable requiring approximately 15 days for
one subject). Figure 10 plots the conditional (CGC) results for the
respectively.
Application
conditional Granger analysis resulted in a substantial refinement
of the plasticity pattern provided by PGC. Examination of the
effects (lower left) by probe location once again revealed the
familiar horizontal pattern of enhancement and depression seen in
the PGC and firing rate results (Note: The continuous vertical
green strips are border electrodes that were excluded from the
conditional analysis and should be ignored). The total causal
change, illustrated in the upper left plot, further revealed a few
primary electrodes whose causality was enhanced by the tetanus.
These remaining causal relationships depicted in Figure 10 may

elsewhere by the spike rate and PGC measures. With the
additional information provided by PGC and CGC a number of
additional experimental manipulations could be created to test
these notions. For example, particularly strong pathways could be
stimulated to selectively increase or decrease plasticity using spiketiming-dependent plasticity rules. Alternatively, particularly strong
causal sources identified by PGC and CGC could be selectively
lesioned which as been shown to have a profound affect on
network activity in neural simulations .
Conclusions
Granger causality is a powerful statistical technique that can
quantify complex causal relationships, ranging from interactions
between different brain areas to recordings from single neurons. In
this paper, we have described the mathematical foundation of this
technique and explored solutions to overcome some of its potential
limitations. We have shown how simple pairwise causal relationships can be quickly and accurately estimated, and illustrated those
techniques in simple neural network simulations. In more complex
relationships, conditional Granger causality was described and
used to untangle direct and mediated influences removing
erroneous causal influences produced by pairwise Granger analysis
alone. We also examined the relationship between the magnitude
of causal estimates and the strength of the underlying synaptic
weights that drive the relationship among neurons in a simulated
network. The resultant nonlinear sigmoid relationship between
these values indicated that very small or very large synaptic
weights may lead to distorted causal estimates which should be
considered when making inferences about the underlying synaptic
weights. Finally, we have described a plasticity experiment in a
living network of cortical neurons in which the accuracy of
Granger causality’s estimates were directly compared with the
results of a firing rate analysis. The results of that analysis support
the notion that GC may provide a more sensitive, reliable, and
detailed representation for detecting plasticity.
Perhaps one of the most challenging problems remaining with
this and many other techniques is detecting the presence of
unobserved (i.e., unrecorded) ‘‘hidden’’ units, where apparent
causal relationships are actually due to unobserved elements. This
possibility must be considered when drawing conclusions about
complex systems that may contain multiple unobserved processes.
Nonetheless, GC remains a potentially powerful technique with
which to determine if a causal relationship exists between two or
more time series. This is true whether those data are from spike
trains, EEG, MRI, gene expression, or any other situation in
which a researcher wishes to quantify potential causal relationships among their data. Especially when those interactions may
be numerous, complex, and difficult to untangle with other

Figure 10. Refinement of Connectivity Patterns With Conditional Granger Causality. Conditional Granger causality was applied to the
center block of electrodes (excluding border electrodes) to illustrate the effect of removing mediated influences. For the analysis of each probe the
causal effect of each electrode upon each target was conditioned by conditioning out the effects of all other electrodes. The left and right panel
shows the results of the conditional analysis for the source and sink measure, respectively. Removing erroneous mediation influences from PGC’s
causal estimates substantially refined the pattern of causal connections. This is most apparent in the total causality (upper right plots of each panel)
where only a few primary electrodes remain, electrodes which may represent the major pathways that were modified by the tetanus.
