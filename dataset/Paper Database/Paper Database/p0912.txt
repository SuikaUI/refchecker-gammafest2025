Inthisageofinformation overload, theability toautomati-
callysummarize newsstories would allowreaders moreabil-
itytocontrol thequantity oftextthattheyread.Given the
accuracy ofcurrent information retrieval systems, atypical
search request returns manyirrelevant documents. Thisis
especially truefornewswire information, sincetherearetyp-
icallymanyarticles onthesameevent. Online summaries
couldaidreaders indetermining iftheywanttoaccess and
readthefullnewsarticles aswellasallowthemtogetthe
gistofthereported eventbyreading thesummary only.
While someprevious approaches usestatistical techniques
toextract oneormoresentences fromthetextwhich can
serveasasummary withmodest success (e.g.,[Rauetd.
1994;Paice1990;Economist 1994]), summarization ingen-
eralhasremained anelusive task.Inthispaper, wepresent a
system, SUMMONS (Summarizing Online NewS articles),
tosummarize fulltextinputusingtemplates produced bythe
message understanding systems developed under theARPA
human language technology program [MUC 1992]. Unlike
previous approaches, oursystem summarizes aseriesofnews
articles onthesameevent, producing aparagraph consisting
ofoneormoresentences. Ourresearch focuses ontechniques
tosummarize howtheperception ofaneventchanges over
time,usingmultiple points ofviewoverthesameeventor
seriesofevents.
Oursystem attempts togenerate fluent textfromsets
oftemplates thatcontain thesalient factsreported inthe
inputtexts. Toproduce thesetemplates, werelyuponthe
ARPA message understanding systems. These systems ac-
ceptfulltextasinput, extracting specific pieces ofinforma-
tionfromagivennewspaper article. Totestoursystem,
weusedthetemplates produced bysystems participating
inMIJC-4 [MUC 1992], available fromtheLinguistic Data
Consortium (LDC), asinput. MUC-4 systems operate on
theterrorist domain andextract information byfillingfields
suchasperpetrator, victim, andtypeofevent, foratotal
number of25fields. Inaddition, wefilledthesametem-
plateforms byhandfromcurrent newsarticles forfurther
testingl. Notethatwhileoursystem usestemplates asin-
put,ifitwereintegrated withoneoftheexisting message
understanding systems, theresulting larger system would
automatically produce summaries ofrawtextinamodular

ofsummarization haveargued thatitwould bedifficult to

which included shortsummaries ofprevious articles.
Weusedthiscorpus todevelop boththecontent plan-
ner(i.e.,themodule which determines whatinformation to
include inthesummary) andthelinguistic component (i.e.,
themodule which determines thewords andsurface syntac.
ticformofthesummary) ofoursystem. Weusedthecorpus
toidentify operators which areusedtocombine information;
thisincludes techniques forlinking information together in
arelated way(e.g.,identifying changes, similarities, trends)
aswellasmaking generalizations. W-ealsoidentified phrases
thatareusedtomarksummaries andusedthesetobuild
thesystem lexicon. Anexample summary produced bythe
sy~tem isshown inFigure 1.Thisparagraph summarizes
fourarticles ontheWorld Trade Center bombing, usingtwo
dii’ierent operators. Thesecond sentence shows acontradic-
tic,nbetween sources (Reuters andAssociated Press) onthe

because theinitial report didnotcontain information about

2Overview ofthesystem
SUMMONS isbasedonthetraditional language generation
system architecture [McKeown 1985;McDonald andPuste-
jovsky 1986;Hovy1988]. Atypical language generator isdi-
videdintotwomaincomponents, acontent planner, which
selects information fromanunderlying knowledge baseto
include inatext,andalinguistic component, which selects
wordstorefertoconcepts contained intheselected informa-
tionandarranges thosewords, appropriately inflecting them,
toformanEnglish sentence. Thecontent planner produces
aconceptual representation oftextmeaning (e.g.,aframe, a
logical form,oraninternal representation oftext)andtyp-
icallydoesnotinclude anylinguistic information. Thelin-
guistic component usesalexicon andagrammar ofEnglish
toperform itstask.Thelexicon contains thevocabulary for
thesystem andencodes constraints about wheneachword
canbeused, Asshown inFigure 2,SUMMONS’ content
planner determines whatinformation fromtheinputMUC
templates should beincluded inthesummary usingasetof
planning operators thatarespecific tosummarization and
tosomeextent, theterrorist domain. Itslinguistic compo-
nentdetermines thephrases andsurface syntactic formof
thesummary. Thelinguistic component consists of
●
●alexical chooser, which determines thehighlevelsen-
tencestructure ofeachsentence andthewords which
realize eachsemantic role,and
theFUF(Functional IJnification Formalism) [Elhadad
1991;Elhadad 1993]sentence generator, which usesa
largesystemic grammar ofEnglish, called SURGE3
[Halliday 1985;Elhadad 1993;Robin 1994]tofillin
syntactic constraints, buildasyntactic tree,choose
closed classwords, andeventually linearize thetree
asasentence.
Input toSUMMONS isasetoftemplates, where each
template represents theinformation extracted fromoneor
morearticles byamessage understanding system. Were-
stricted thedomain toarticles onterrorism, sincethiswas
whatwasavailable fromtheLDC. However, thehand-
const,ructed templates included terrorist events suchasthe
JVorld TradeCenter bombing, theHebrou Mosque massacre,
andairline hijackings, whichmayormaynothavebeenhan-
dledbytheoriginal message understanding systems. Ik’ealso
created byhandasetoftemplates unrelated torealnewswire
messages which weusedfortesting sometechniques ofour
system. Weenriched thetemplates forthesecasesbyadding
fourslots:theprimary source, thesecondary source andthe

rization, because thereareoftenconflicts between different

Output isaparagraph consisting ofoneormoresen-
tences, where thelength ofthesummary iscontrolled bya
variable inputparameter. Atthispoint, wehavenotheory
onhowtodetermine thelength ofasummary, butassume
thatlikeanygoodpaper writer, givenmorespace, SUM-
MONS canuseittoinclude moreinformation. Information
isratedintermsofimportance, where information thatap-
pearsinonlyonearticle isgivenalowerrating andinforma-
tionthatissynthesized frommultiple articles isratedmore
highly. When spaceallows, SUMMONS maychoose toin-
cludethebasefactsfromtwoseparate articles aswellasthe
conclusion thatcanbedrawn fromboth,whilegivenless
space, onlythesummarizing factwould beincluded.
Development ofSUMMONS wasmadeeasierbecause of
thelanguage generation toolsandframework available at
Columbia University. Nochanges intheFUFsentence ~en-
erator wereneeded. Inaddition, thelexical chooser andcon-
tentrianner werebasedouthedesire usedinthePLANDoc
autokated documentation system; developed jointly with
Bellcore tosummarize theactivities oftelephone planning
engineers [McKeown etal.1994]. Inparticular, weusedFUF
toimplement thelexical chooser, representing thelexicon as
agrammar aswehavedoneinmanyprevious systems (e.g.,
[Elhadad 1993;Robin 1994;McKeown etal.1993;Feiner and
McKeown 1991]), andthusthemaineffortwasinidentifying
thewords andphrases needed forthedomain. Thecontent
planner, implemented inPERL, features several stages, as
doesthePLANDoc system. Itfirstgroups messages to-
gether. identifies commonalities between them. andnotes “/
howthediscourse influences wording bysetting realization
flags.Before lexical choice, SUMMONS mapsthetemplates
intotheFDformalism expected asinputtoFUFanduses
adomain ontology (derived fromtheontologies represented
inthemessage understanding systems) toenrich theinput.Themainpointofdeparture forSUMMONS isinthe
stageofidentifying whatinformation toinclude andhowto
group ittogether, aswellastheuseofacorpus toguide
thisandlaterprocesses. InPLANDoc, successive messages
areverysimilar andtheproblem istoformagrouping that
putsthemostsimilar messages together, allowing theuse
ofconjunction andellipsis todelete repetitive material. For
summarizing multiple newsarticles, thetaskisalmost the
oPPoslte; we.needtofindthedifferences fromonearticle
tothenext,Identifying howthenewshaschanged. Thus,
themainproblem wastheidentification ofsummarization
strategies, whichindicate howinformation islinked together
toformaconcise andcohesive summary. Aswehavefound
inotherwork[Robin 1994], whatinformation isincluded is
oftendependent onthelanguage available tomakeconcise
additions. Thus, usingacorpus summary wascritical to
identifying thedifferent summaries possible.
3Methodology: collecting andusingasummary corpus
Inordertoproduce plausible andunderstandable summaries,
weusedavailable on-line corpora asmodels, including the
WallStreet Journal andcurrent newswire fromReuters and
theAssociated Press. Ourcorpora contain about 2MBof
newsarticles. Wehavemanually grouped articles inthreads
related tosingleevents orseriesofsimilar events.
Fromthesocollected corpora weextracted manually, and
aftercareful investigation, several hundred language con-
structions whichwefoundrelevant tothetypesofsummaries
thatwewanttoproduce. Someexamples ofsuchphrases
areincluded inFigures 7–9.Inaddition tothesummary
cuephrases collected fromthecorpus, wealsotriedtoin-
corporate asmanyphrases aspossible thathaverelevance
tothemessage understanding conference domain. Dueto
domain variety, suchphrases wereessentially scarce inthe
newswire corpora andweneeded tocollect themfromother
sources (e.g.,modifying templates thatweacquired fromthe
summary corpora toprovide awidercoverage).
Sinceoneofourgoalshasbeenconciseness, wehavetried
toassemble smallparagraph summaries which inessence de-
scribe asingleeventanditschange overtime,oraseriesof
related events withnomorethanafewsentences.
4Summary operators forcontent planning
Wehavedeveloped asetofheuristics derived fromthecor-
porawhichdecide whattypesofsimple sentences constitute
asummary, inwhatordertheyneedtobelisted, aswell
asthewaysinwhich simple sentences arecombined into
morecomplex ones. Inaddition, wehavespecified which
summarization-specific phrases aretobeincluded indiffer-
enttypesofsummaries.
Weattempt toidentify apreeminent setoftemplates
fromtheinputtothesystem. Thissetneeds tocontain a
largenumber ofsimilar fields. Ifthisholds, wecanmerge
thesetintoasimpler structure, keeping thecommon fea-
turesandmarking thedistinct features asElhadad [1993]
andMcKeown etal.[1994] suggest.
Ateachstep,asummary operator isselected based on
existing similarities between messages inthedatabase. This
operator isthenapplied totheinput templates, resulting
inanewtemplate which combines, orsynthesizes, informa-
tionfromtheold.Eachoperator isindependent fromthe
otherandseveral canbeapplied insuccession totheinput
templates. Eachofthesevenmajor operators isfurther sub-
divided tocovervarious modifications ofitsinputandout-

Asummary operator encodes ameans forlinking infor-
mation intwodifferent templates. Oftenitresults insynthe-
sisofnewinformation. Forexample, ageneralization may
beformed fromtwoindependent facts. Alternatively, since
wearesummarizing reports written overtime,highlighting
howknowledge oftheeventchanged isimportant andthus,
summaries sometimes mustidentify differences between re-
ports, Adescription oftheoperators weidentified inour
cc]rpus follows, accompanied byanexample ofsystem out-
putforeachoperator. Eachexample primarily summarizes
twoinput templates, asthisistheresult fromapplying a
singleoperator once.Morecomplex summaries canbepro-
duced byapplying multiple operators onthesameinput, as
shown intheintroductory example.
4,1Change ofperspective
when aninitial report getsafactwrong orhasincomplete
information, thechange isusually included inasummary.
Inorderforthisoperator toapply, thesource fieldmustbe
thesame, whilethevalueofanother fieldchanges sothat
itisnotcompatible withtheoriginal value. Forexample,
ifthenumber ofvictims changes, weknowthatthefirstre-
portwaswrong ifthenumber goesdown, whilethesource
l~zd~ncomplete information (oradditional people died)ifthe
number goesup.Thefirsttwosentences fromthefollowing
example weregenerated usingthechange ofperspective op-
erator. Theinitial estimate of“atleastfivepeople” killed
irtheincident becomes “exactly fivepeop~e”:
Theafternoon ofFebruary 26,1993, Reuters
r~ported thatasuspected bombkilled atleast
fivepeople intheWorld Trade Center. Later,
Reuters announced thatexactly fivepeople were
killed intheblast.
4.2Contradiction
VJhen twosources report conflicting information about the
sameevent, acontradiction arises. Asummary cannot re-
porteither ofthemastrue,butcanindicate thatthefacts
arenotclear. Thenumber ofsources thatcontradict each
othercanindicate thelevelofconfusion about theevent.
Notethatthecurrent output ofthemessage understand-
ingsystems doesnotinclude sources. However, SIJIVIiLf ONS
c>uldusethisfeature toreport disagreement between out-
putbydifferent systems. Asummary might indicate that
i3BNdetermined that20people werekilled, whileNMSU
determined only5werekilled. Thedifference between this
example andtheprevious oneonChange ofPerspective isthesource oftheupdate. Ifthesamesource announces a
change, thenweknowthatithasrealized achange inthe
facts.Otherwise, anadditional source presents information
which isnotnecessarily morecorrect thantheinformation
presented bytheearlier source.
Theafternoon ofFebruary 26,1993, Reuters
reported thatasuspected bombkilled atleast
fivepeople intheWorld Trade Center. However,
Associated Press announced thatexactly five
people werekilled intheblast.
4.3Addition
When asubsequent report indicates thatadditional facts
became known, thisisreported inasummary. Additional
results oftheeventmayoccuraftertheinitial report orad-
ditional information maybecome known. Theoperator de-
termines thisbythewaythevalueofatemplate slotchanges
(upfornumbers).
January Ist1994, Reuters announced thatthree
terrorists killed fourcivilians inthefirst
assault. Later, Reuters reported thatthree people
werekilled inthesecond assault. Atotal of
seven people werekilled inthetwoassaults.
4.4Refinement
Insubsequent reports amoregeneral factmayberefined.
Thus,ifthelocation isoriginally reported tobeNewYork
Cityjit mightlaterbenotedasaparticular borough ofNew
York. Or,ifaterrorist group isidentified asPalestinian,
latertheexactnameoftheterrorist group maybedeter-
mined. Sincetheupdate isassigned ahigher valueof“im-
portance”, itwillbefavored overtheoriginal message ina
shorter summary. Sentence 3fromtheintroductory exam-
plewasgenerated usingtherefinement operator. sincethe
responsibility fortheterrorist actwasattributed toArab
terrorists, whereas earlier reports didnotinclude perpetra-
torinformation.
Finally, Associated Press announced thatArab
terrorists werepossibly responsible forthe
terrorist act.
4.5Agreement
Iftwosources agreeonthefacts, thiswillheighten the
reader’s confidence intheirveracity andthus,agreement be-
tweensources isusually reported.
Themorning ofMarch 1st1994, UPIreported that
aruanwaskidnapped intheBronx. Later, this
wasconfirmed byReuters.
4.6Superset

themhaveincomplete information, itispossible tocombine
information fromthemtoproduce amorecomplete sum-
mary.
According toUPI,three terrorists werearrested
inMedellin lastTuesday. Reuters announced that

ternsovertime.Thus, wemight notice thatthreeconsecu-
tivebombiugs occurred atthesamelocation andsummarize
themintoasinglesentence. Thisis theonlyoperator which
isnotimplemented inthecurrent version ofthesystem.
4.8Noinformation
Sinceweareinterested inconveying information about the
primary andsecondary source ofacertain pieceofnews,
whicharegenerally trusted sources ofinformation, weought
topayattention alsotothelackofinformation fromacertain
source whensuchisexpected tobepresent. Forexample,
itmight bethecasethatacertain newsagency reports a
terrorist actinagivencountry, buttheauthorities ofthat
country don’tgiveoutanyinformation. Anexample ofuse
ofthenoz’n~ormatzon operator isgiveninFigure 8.
5Algorithm
Thealgorithm usedinthesystem tosort, combine, andgen-
eralize theinputmessages canbedescribed asfollows:
5.1Input
Atthisstage, thesystem receives asetoftemplates from
theMessage Understanding Conferences orasimilar setof
messages fromarelated domain. Alltemplates aredescribed
aslistsofattribute/value pairs(seeFigure 5).These pairs
aredefined intheMUCguidelines [MUC 1992].
5.2Preprocessing
Thisstageincludes thefollowing substages:
●
●
●
●
●Thetemplates aresorted inchronological order. A
laterstagewilltakecareoftheirconceptual ordering,
Messages thathaveobviously beenincorrectly gener-
atedbyaM~JCsystem areidentified andfiltered out
byhand.
Adatabase ofallfieldsandmessages iscreated. This
database isusedlaterasabasisforgrouping andcol-
lapsing messages.
Allirrelevant fieldsorfieldscontaining badvalues are
manually marked assuchanddon’tparticipate infur-
theranalyses.
Knowledge ofthesource oftheinformation ismarked
asthespecific Message Understanding System forthe
sitesubmitting thetemplate ifitisnotpresent inthe
inputtemplate. Notethat,sincethecurrent Message
Understanding Systems donotextract thesource, this
isthemostspecific wecanbeforsuchcases.5.3Heuristic combination
Thetemplate database isscanned forinteresting relation-
shipsbetween templates. Suchpatterns trigger reordering of
thetemplates andmodification oftheirindividual “impor-
tance” values. Asanexample, iftwotemplates arecombined
withthe“Refinement” operator, the“importance” valueof
thecombined message willbegreater thanthesumofthe
individual “importances” oftheconstituent messages. At
thesametime,thevalues ofthese2messages arelowered
(stillkeeping ahigher valueonthelater,morecorrect ofthe
two).Alltemplates directly extracted fromtheMUCoutput
areassigned aninitial import antevalueof100.Currently,
witheachapplication ofanoperator, welowerthevalueofa
contributing individual template by20points andgiveany
newly produced template thatcombines information from
already existing contributing templates avaluegreater than
thesumofthevalues ofthecontributing templates after
thosevalues havebeenupdated. Furthermore, someoP-
erators reduce theimportance values ofexisting templates
evenfurther (e.g.,therefinement operator reduces theim-
portance ofchronologically earlier templates byadditional
increments of20points because theycontain outdated in-
formation). These values weresetempirically andfuture
workwillincorporate amoreformal approach. Thus, the
finalsummary islikelytocontain onlythecombined mes-
sageiftherearerestrictions onlength. Itcanalsocontain all
threeofthemiflength restrictions areconsiderably lax.The
valueofthe“importance” ofthemessage corresponds alsoto
theposition inthesummary paragraph, asmoreimportant
messages willbegenerated first.
Each newtemplate contains information indicating
whether itsconstituent templates areobsolete andthusno
longer needed. Alsojatthisstagetheglobal coverage vec-
tor(adatastructure which keepstrackofwhich templates
havebeenalready combined andwhich onesarestilltobe
considered inapplying operators) isupdated topointtothe
messages which arestillactive andcanbefurther combined,
Thiswaywemakesurethatallmessages stillhaveachance
ofparticipating intheactual summary.
Theresulting messages arecombined intosmall“para-
graphs” according totheeventorseriesofevents thatthey
describe. Eachparagraph canthenberealized bythelin-
guistic component. Eachsetoftemplates produces asingle
paragraph.
5.4Discourse planning
C+iven the~elative importance ofthemessages included in
thedatabase aftertheHeuristic Combination stage, thecon-
tentplanner iscalledtoorganize thepresentation ofinfornla-
tionwithin aparagraph. Itlooksatconsecutive messages
inthedatabase, marked asseparate paragraphs fromthe
previous stage, andassigns values to“realization switches”
[McKeown etal.1994]which control localchoices suchas
tenseandvoice. Theyalsogovern thepresence o,lackof
certain constituents toavoidrepetition ofconstituents and
tosatisfy anaphora constraints,
5.5Format conversion
Allmessages included inthedatabase andaugmented
through thecontent planner aresenttoaso-called “lispize”
module whichconverts therecords ofthemessage databases
intoFUFFunctional descriptions (FD’s) [Elhadad 19Y3].

5.6Ordering oftemplates andlinguistic generation
Inordertoproduce thefinaltext,SUMMONS carries out
thefollowing steps:
cTemplates aresorted according totheorderofthe
valueofthe“importance” slot.Onlythetoptemplates
arerealized. Messages withhigher importance values
appear withpriority inthesummary ifarestriction on
length isspecified.
oAnintermediate module, theontologizer, converts fac-
tualinformation fromthemessage database intodata
structures compatible withtheontology oftheMUC
domain. Thisisused,forexample, tomakegeneraliza-
tions(e.g.,thatMedellin andBogota areinColombia).
●Thelexical chooser component ofSUMMONS isafunc-
tional(systemic) grammar whichemphasizes theuseof
summarization phrases originating fromthesummary
corpora.
●Thesurface generation fromtheaugmented message
FD’sisperformed usingSURGE andFUF.Wehave
written additional generation code tohandle
paragraph-level constructions (thesummarization op-
erators).

Thedifferent values ofSECSOURCE:SOURCE andSEC-
SOURCE:DATE inthetwomessage templates trigger the
activation ofthecontradiction operator. Thatoperator
makes useofthefactthattherehasbeenanapparent change
inthenumber ofvictims (morespecifically, theperception
ofthischange between twosources ofreformation, inthis
case,twoSECSOURCES). Bylooking atthediverging val-
uesaswellasthetimesofthetworeports, thecontent plan-
ner,activates thecontradiction operator anddecides that:
● theinformation contained inthesecond template
should follow thefirstone.
● thereisalogical connection between thetwotemplates
inthat,avalueofonefieldchanges overtime.Accord-
ingly,thecontent planner includes anappropriate re-
alization switch forthesecond template which willbe
usedbythelexical chooser module.
Ontheotherhand, thelexical choice component ofthe

icallyrelated tosummarization:

present, thelinguistics module willinclude anappro-

inbothinterpretation andgeneration, anditisonlyrecently

solving thefullnatural language problem andtoallowsum-
marization inarbitrary domains. someresearchers haveap-

andoftenreliesheavily onscripts (e.g.,[DeJong1979;Tait

identifying strategies forsummarization [Sparck Jones1993]
which studies howvarious discourse processing techniques
(e.g.,rhetorical structure relations) canbeusedtobothiden-

Theprototype system thatwehavedeveloped serves asthe
springboard forresearch inavariety ofdirections. First
andforemost istheneedtousestatistical techniques toin-

todetermine which phrases wereusedfo~summarization.
Inotherwords, weknewofnoautomatic wayofidentify-
ingsummary phrases. However, having aninitial seedset
ofsummary phrases might allowustoautomate asecond
passanalysis ofthecorpus bylooking forvariant patterns
oftheoneswehavefound. Byusingautomated, statistical
techniques tofindadditional phrases, wecouldincrease the

10Conclusions
Onrprototype system demonstrates thefeasibility ofgen-
erii.ting summaries ofaseriesofnewsarticles onthesame
evmt, highlighting changes overtime.Theability toauto-
miitically provide summaries oftextual material willcriti-
calyaidineffective useoftheinternet inordertoavoid
overload ofinformation. Weshowhowplanning operators
canbeusedtosynthesize summary content fromindividual
templates, eachrepresenting asingle article. These plan-
ningoperators areempirically based, coming fromanalysis
ofexisting summaries, andallowforthegeneration ofcon-
cisesummaries. Ourframework allows forexperimentation
withdifferent length summaries andforthecombination of
multiple, independent summary operators toproduce more
complex summaries.
Oursystem wasdeveloped under somewhat primitive
conditions, without theability toaccess andchange the
interpretation component ofthesystem, without access to
thefullsetofcurrent output produced bymessage under-
standing systems, andwithout anexisting corpus ofsum-
maries. Consequently, ourresults include thedevelopment of
amethodological framework toeasefuture implementation
ofnewssummarization systems; thisincludes collecting the
summary corpus, structuring itaround threads ofarticles
onthesameevents withlaterarticles including summaries,andidentifying summarizing phrases. Thisseedworkwill
allowustoapplyautomated techniques (e.g.,[Smadja 1991;

teristics ofthesephrases, wecanusethisseedsettoguide

alsoallowforevaluation ofthegenerated summaries; devel-
opment ofanevaluation procedure willrequire additional
