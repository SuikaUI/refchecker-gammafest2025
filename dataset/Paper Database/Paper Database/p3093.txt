Tremendous progress in the science of extrasolar planets has been
achieved since the discovery of a Jupiter orbiting the nearby Sun-like star 51 Pegasi
Theoretical models have now reached enough maturity to predict the
characteristic properties of these new worlds, mass, radius, atmospheric signatures,
and can be confronted with available observations. We review our current knowledge of
the physical properties of exoplanets, internal structure and composition, atmospheric
signatures, including expected biosignatures for exo-Earth planets, evolution, and
the impact of tidal interaction and stellar irradiation on these properties for the
short-period planets.
We discuss the most recent theoretical achievements in the
ﬁeld and the still pending questions.
We critically analyse the diﬀerent solutions
suggested to explain abnormally large radii of a signiﬁcant fraction of transiting
exoplanets. Special attention is devoted to the recently discovered transiting objects
in the overlapping mass range between massive planets and low-mass brown dwarfs,
stressing the ambiguous nature of these bodies, and we discuss the possible observable
diagnostics to identify these two distinct populations.
We also review our present
understanding of planet formation and critically examine the diﬀerent suggested
formation mechanisms. We expect the present review to provide the basic theoretical
background to capture the essential of the physics of exoplanet formation, structure
and evolution, and the related observable signatures.

The physical properties of extrasolar planets
1. Introduction
The end of the twentieth century saw a revolution in our knowledge of planetary systems.
The discovery of the ﬁrst extrasolar planet in 1995 marked the beginning of a modern era
and a change of our perception of planets. The discoveries continue apace and reveal an
extraordinary diversity of planetary systems and exoplanet physical properties, raising
new questions in the ﬁeld of planetary Science. More than 400 exoplanets have now been
unveiled by radial velocity measurements, microlensing experiments and photometric
transit observations. They span a wide range of masses from a few Earth masses to
a few tens of Jupiter masses ( ). The realm of terrestrial exoplanets starts to open
its doors with the lightest known exoplanet, GJ 581e, detected by radial velocity and
having a mass M. sin i = 1.9 Earth masses ( M⊕) ( ). At the opposite end of the mass
range, an ambiguity appears on the nature of newly discovered objects. It now becomes
clear that giant planets and brown dwarfs share a common mass range, likely between
a few Jupiter masses and several tens of Jupiter masses.
Coincidently, the ﬁrst brown dwarf was discovered at nearly the same time as the
ﬁrst exoplanet, but with diﬀerent technologies and observational strategies. Identifying
these two astrophysical body populations remains an open issue.
Brown dwarfs are
supposed to form like stars through the gravitational fragmentation of a molecular
cloud while planets are thought to form in a protoplanetary disk subsequently to star
formation. A brown dwarf is an object unable to sustain stable hydrogen fusion because
of the onset of electron degeneracy in its central region.
This deﬁnition provides a
theoretical upper limit for their mass: objects below ∼0.07 solar masses (M⊙) or
70 Jupiter masses (MJup) belong to the brown dwarf realm ( ). But brown dwarfs
with increasingly small masses have now begun to be discovered, reaching masses
characteristic of our solar system gaseous giants.
In parallel, planet hunters have
discovered massive objects around central stars with orbital properties characteristic
of planetary systems. They have been faced with an unprecedented diﬃculty to name
their favourite object and the community even called into question the deﬁnition of
a planet ( ). This uncertainty about how to call these objects yields some sterile,
semantic debates which shed more confusion than light.
On a theoretical point of view, the physical properties of giant planets and brown
dwarfs can be described within similar theoretical frameworks, the two families of objects
being closely related in terms of atmospheric and interior properties. Because of diﬀerent
formation processes, distinctions are expected concerning their composition and content
of heavy elements and these diﬀerences must be taken into account in theoretical models.
But clearly, the nascent theory for exoplanets has inherited from our knowledge of the
Solar System planets, mostly developed during the past century, and from the recent
progress performed in the modelling of brown dwarfs. Therefore, the description of the
physical properties of exoplanets is built on a combination of our knowledge in planetary
and stellar science.
The aim of our review is to present the status of the modern theory describing
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
atmospheric, interior and evolutionary properties of exoplanets, as well as their
formation mechanisms.
Most exoplanets yet detected through radial velocity and
photometric transits are giant planets, characterised by the presence of a gaseous
envelope mostly made of hydrogen and helium ( ).
Crucial constraints on their
structure are revealed by photometric transit and Doppler follow-up techniques, which
provide a measure of their mass and radius.
Information on the mean density and
bulk composition of several exoplanets is thus now available, drastically extending the
knowledge of planetary structures restricted till recently to our four giant planets.
Atmospheric properties of exoplanets also start to be measured and ﬁrst constraints
on temperature structure, composition and dynamics are now available. At dawn of
their discovery, no observational constraints on Earth-like exoplanets are yet available.
Our review is thus essentially devoted to giant planets and we will only brieﬂy describe
the ﬁrst theoretical eﬀorts devoted to the description of terrestrial exoplanets.
The review is organised as follows.
As introductory sections to the ﬁeld, §2
and §3 provide brief overviews of solar and extra-solar system planets and of our
current understanding of planet formation, respectively. Interior structure properties of
terrestrial to jovian planets are described in §4, while §5 is devoted to their atmospheric
properties. Evolutionary properties, describing planet cooling and contraction history
and the mass-radius relationship are presented in §6.
Tidal eﬀects and star-planet
interactions are examined in §7.
Current observational constraints (e.g transiting
radii, planetary light detection) are analysed in §8. Finally, some future advancements
expected in the ﬁeld are discussed in §9.
2. A brief overview of observations
In this section, we present observed properties of Solar and extra-solar planets which
are relevant for the understanding of exoplanet physical properties. For more details,
we invite the reader to refer to the reviews by on Solar System giant planets and
by on statistical properties of exoplanets.
2.1. Lessons from our Solar System
The understanding of planetary structure starts with the extensive works conducted
on our Solar System giant planets. Important constraints on interior structures of our
four giant planets are provided by measurement of their gravity ﬁeld through analysis
of the trajectories of the space missions Voyager and Pioneer. Our giant planets are
fast rotators, with rotation periods of about 10 hours for Jupiter and Saturn, and
about 17 hours for Neptune and Uranus.
Rotation modiﬁes the internal structure
of a ﬂuid body and yields departure of the gravitational potential from a spherically
symmetric potential. Within the framework of a perturbation theory largely developed
for rotating stars and planets, sometimes referred to as the theory of ﬁgures ( ),
the gravitational potential can be expressed in terms of even (for axysymetric bodies)

Legendre Polynomials and gravitational moments J2n. The latter are related to the
inner density proﬁle of the rotating object. Measurements of J2, J4 and J6 for the four
giant planets yield stringent constraints on their inner density proﬁle. An abundant
literature exists on the application of the theory of ﬁgures to our four giant planets and
most models are based on the so-called three-layer model ( ). For Jupiter and Saturn,
models assume that the planetary interior consists of a central rocky and/or icy core†, an
inner ionised helium and hydrogen envelope, and an outer neutral He and molecular H2
envelope (see and references therein). Table 1 summarizes the results of a detailed
analysis performed by , taking into account uncertainties on the equation of state for
hydrogen at high density. More recent models for Jupiter were derived by based
on improved equations of state for H and He derived from ﬁrst-principles methods. They
however reach contradictory conclusions. While essentially agree with the results of
 , ﬁnd a larger core, of about 16 M⊕, and exclude a solution without a core. These
two recent works illustrate the remaining uncertainties on planetary modelling and on
equations of state of matter under conditions characteristic of giant planet interiors (see
The lighter giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, are more enriched in heavy elements
than their massive companions. A wide variety of models can match the mass/radius
of these planets.
Three-layer models with a central rocky core, an ice layer and an
outer H/He envelope suggest an overall composition of 25% by mass of rocks, 60-70%
of ices and 5-15% of gaseous H/He ( ). Other solutions exist, as suggested by ,
assuming, instead of a pure ice second layer, a mixture of ice, rock and gas (see Table
2). According to recent estimates, an upper limit for the H/He mass fraction is about
5 M⊕for Uranus and 4.7 M⊕for Neptune if only rock and H/He are present ( ).
Interestingly enough, models for Uranus assuming that each layer is homogeneous
with an adiabatic temperature proﬁle fail to reproduce the gravitational moments. An
interesting solution for this problem, suggested by , is to assume that some parts of
† The term ”rock” usually refers to silicates (Mg-, Si- and O-rich compounds) and the term ”ice”
involves a mixture of volatiles dominantly composed of water, with traces of methane and ammonia.

The models assume (i) one rock layer, (ii) one layer composed of a mixture of rock, ice
and H/He and (iii) a third layer of H/He. Mrock, Mice and MH/He are the total masses

the layers are not homogeneously mixed. In the presence of a persistent molecular weight
gradient, convection can be conﬁned in numerous homogeneous layers separated by
thin diﬀusive interfaces. This process, known as layered or double diﬀusive convection,
provides a solution to reproduce the observed gravitational moments in Uranus ( ).
We will see in section 8.1 that this process may also be relevant for extra-solar transiting
The analysis of the atmospheric composition of our giant planets also shows a
signiﬁcant enrichment in heavy elements. Abundances of several elements (C, N, S, Ar,
Kr, Xe) have been measured in situ by the Galileo probe for Jupiter and they show a
global enrichment compared to solar values of about a factor 3 ( ). For Saturn,
spectroscopic detections of methane and ammonia suggest signiﬁcant enrichment of C
(about a factor 6 ) and N (about a factor 2 ), although with large uncertainties
for the latter element. For Uranus and Neptune, carbon is signiﬁcantly enriched, with
large factors > 20 ( ) while the abundance of N/H is comparable to that of Jupiter
and Saturn ( ).
The interior and atmospheric properties of our giant planets bear important
consequences on our general perception of planetary structure.
The observational
evidences that our giant planets are enriched in heavy material support our general
understanding of planet formation (see §3) and guide the development of a general
theory for exoplanets.
2.2. Observed properties of exoplanets
The description of exoplanet physical properties must encompass the wide variety of
planetary masses and orbital separations yet discovered, as illustrated in Fig. 1. About
30% of exoplanets have an orbital separation a less than 0.1 AU. Irradiation eﬀects from
their parent star must thus be accounted for for a correct description of their structural
and evolutionary properties. Another compelling property of exo-planetary systems is
the correlation between planet-host star metallicity‡ and frequency of planets.
‡ The metallicity is deﬁned as the mass fraction of all chemical elements heavier than helium.
The physical properties of extrasolar planets

(from the web site of F. Pont: 
probability of ﬁnding giant planets is a strong function of the parent star metallicity,
indicating that an environment enriched in heavy material favours planet formation
( ). This correlation, however, is not observed for light Neptune-mass planets ( ),
although the statistics is still poor. About twenty of these light planets have yet been
discovered ( ). These trends provide clues about their formation process, as discussed
Crucial information on interior structure and bulk composition of exoplanets are
unveiled by objects transiting in front of their parent star. About sixty of these planets
have yet been detected, revealing an extraordinary variety in mean planetary densities
and composition. As illustrated in Fig. 2, some exoplanets are signiﬁcantly denser,
thus more enriched in heavy material than our own giant planets. One of the most
remarkable discovery is the Saturn mass planet HD 149026b with such a small radius
that more than 70 M⊕of heavy material is required to explain it ( ). This discovery
raises the question of the formation process of planets with such a large amount of heavy
material. More importantly, it tells us that exoplanets, like our Solar System planets,

and Neptune are indicated by full circles.
The curve shows theoretical predictions
for solar metallicity objects Z

Note that the weak
enrichment in heavy material of Jupiter (Z ∼10%, see Table 1) is counterbalanced
by the eﬀect of rotation (see §2.1), and the radius of Jupiter is coincidentally
reproduced by solar composition models. Data taken from the web site of F. Pont:
 
may contain large amounts of heavy material, supporting our current understanding of
planetary formation (see §3).
Another puzzling property revealed by Fig. 2 is the abnormally large radius of
a signiﬁcant fraction of transiting planets.
Oddly enough, the very ﬁrst transiting
planet ever discovered, HD209458b ( ), was found with a large radius which still
challenges our understanding of planetary structure. At the time of this writing, the
two most inﬂated exoplanets known are TRES-4b, with a radius Rp = 1.78RJup and
a mass Mp= 0.9 MJup ( ) and WASP-12b, with R = 1.79RJup and Mp= 1.4 MJup
( ). These observations indicate that new mechanisms are required to inﬂate close-in
planets. Whether these mechanisms are peculiar, operating only under very speciﬁc
conditions and planetary system conﬁgurations, or whether basic physics is missing in
the modelling of close-in giant planets are still open questions. Several mechanisms have
been proposed since the discovery of HD209458, but no ﬁrm answer has been obtained
for now. In this review, we will present the main proposed mechanisms and discuss their

status (§8.1).
3. Planet formation
3.1. Core-accretion model
The presently most widely accepted scenario for giant planet formation is the so-called
core-accretion model .
In this model, solid cores grow oligarchically in the
surrounding nebula by accreting small planetesimals§, located within the protoplanet’s
zone of gravitational inﬂuence, called the feeding zone, which extends over a few
Hills radii (RH = a(Mp/3M⋆)1/3, where Mp and M⋆denote the protoplanet and star
mass, respectively and a the planet’s orbital radius). The planetesimal accretion rate
dms/dt ∝Σs ≈10−5 M⊕/yr, where Σs denotes the local surface density of solids at
the orbital radius (Σs ≃3 (a/5 AU)−3/2 g cm−2 for the minimum-mass solar nebula
Once the solid core has grown of the order of a Mars mass (∼0.1 M⊕), it starts
capturing an envelope of nebular gas and the protoplanet’s growth is governed by
a quasistatic balance between radiative loss and accretion energy due dominantly
to planetesimals (planetesimals are supposed to sink to the planet’s central regions
whereas the accreted gas remains near the surface), with a negligible contribution
from the PdV contraction work.
Both solid and gas accretion rates are relatively
constant during this phase, with gas accretion exceeding the planetesimal one. Above
a critical mass Mcrit, a static envelope can no longer be supported.
Gravitational
contraction is now necessary to compensate the radiative loss, which increases in turn
gas accretion, leading to a runaway process, and the core accretes a massive gas envelope,
becoming a newborn giant planet. For an envelope dust-dominated opacity (κ ∼0.1-1
cm2/g), Mcrit ∼10 M⊕, although with large possible variations due to the sensitive
dependence of Mcrit upon the envelope composition (mean molecular weight, opacity),
the planetesimal accretion rate and the distance of the planet to the star . At
this stage, the mass of accreted gas is comparable to the mass of accreted planetesimals
and the atmosphere has grown massive enough that its radiative loss can no longer be
balanced by planetesimal accretion. The massive (dominantly H/He) envelope can no
longer maintain quasi-static equilibrium and it falls in free fall onto the central core.
The nascent planet’s radius is essentially ﬁxed by this accretion shock condition. This
process, and thus the expected radius and luminosity of young planets, however, remains
ill determined, given the lack of a proper treatment of the radiative shock (see discussion
in §6.2, ).
The main problem faced by the conventional core-accretion model is that core
growth takes longer than typical protoplanetary disk lifetimes, ≲a few Myr . Giant
planet cores can be obtained within the appropriate timescale either by increasing
§ deﬁned as solid objects present in protoplanetary disks.
∥The minimum-mass solar nebula is deﬁned as the protoplanetary disk of solar composition that
contains the minimum amount of solids necessary to build the planets of our Solar System ( ).
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
severely the disk density compared to the MMSN or by reducing drastically the accreting
envelope opacity, allowing rapid core contraction. A reduced opacity implies dust grains
signiﬁcantly larger than in the ISM, and thus eﬃcient settling in the warmer parts of
the disk, where they are destroyed . Spiral density waves generated in the gas by
the core, however, cause this latter to migrate inward, the so-called type-I migration,
with a characteristic timescale tI = a/|˙a| ∼Ω−1( M⋆
Σgasa2)( H
r )2 ≈( M⋆
for values appropriate to the MMSN, where Ωdenotes the protoplanet’s Keplerian
angular velocity and H the disk scale height .
This timescale is much
shorter than the time required to build up a 10 M⊕core in standard core accretion
models. These calculations, however, assume that the disk is laminar (linear planetdisk perturbations). Simulations including the eﬀect of (MHD) turbulence in the disk
show that the mean torque does not converge towards the value obtained in a laminar
disk (at least for the duration of the simulations) and that the usual type I migration
is disrupted by turbulence . Analysis of these stochastic torques suggests that
a planet can overcome type-I migration for several orbital periods, P = 2π/Ω. Above
a critical mass, of the order of 30 M⊕at 5 AU (although with large uncertainties) for
typical protoplanetary disk conditions, the planet’s gravitational tidal torque exceeds
the viscous torque, eventually stopping the motion of the protoplanet. Deposition of
angular momentum in the planet’s vicinity, due to shock and viscous dissipation, pushes
material away from the planet, clearing an annular gap in the disk . The planet
is now locked in the disk and undergoes type-II migration with a timescale given by the
disk viscous timescale tII ≃5 × 106 Ω−1( 10−4
10 AU)3/2 yr, assuming a Shakura-
Sunyaev type viscosity law, ν = αcsH, where cs is the isothermal sound speed averaged
over the vertical structure . Note that this timescale is now independent of the
protoplanet’s mass. Gap clearing and disk dissipation will limit the accretion onto the
central core once the nebula starts falling down around it - although further accretion
is possible if the protoplanet has an eccentric orbit - and the planet’s ﬁnal mass is set
up by these limits.
Taking into account migration processes in the core-accretion model has been found
to speed up core growth by increasing the supply of planetesimals, avoiding the depletion
of the feeding zone obtained in the in-situ formation models and solving the timescale
problem of the standard core-accretion scenario . Planets, including our own
solar system giants, now form on a timescale consistent with disk lifetimes, with the
appropriate observational signatures . These models, however, have to reduce the
conventional type-I migration rate by a factor ≥10. It is currently not clear whether
turbulent-induced stochastic migration can yield such a decrease over signiﬁcant (≳105
yr) timescales and the real impact of stochastic migration remains an open issue.
Interestingly, recent core-accretion simulations including the concurrent growth and
migration of multiple embryos ﬁnd a global negative impact on planet formation: while
migration indeed extends the domain of accretion for an embryo, this latter must also
compete with other earlier generation embryos which have depleted the inner regions of
solid material, reducing the ﬁnal number of giant-planet cores .
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
In summary, including migration in the conventional core-accretion model succeeds
in forming giant planets within appropriate timescales down to the inner edge of the
disk. These models, however, use disk surface densities or dust-to-gas ratios about 2-3
times larger than the MMSN (suggesting that giant planet cores are unlikely to form
in a MMSN) and require adequate planetesimal sizes and/or viscosity parameters α in
order for giant planet cores to grow rapidly before type-I or type-II migration moves
them into the star. Unfortunately, these parameters, which involve complex processes
such as grain growth/fragmentation or turbulent viscosity are very uncertain and can
vary over orders of magnitude.
3.2. Gravitational instability
The alternative theory for giant planet formation is direct gravitational fragmentation
and collapse of a protoplanetary disc, the so-called gravitational instability (GI) scenario
 , originally suggested to circumvent the timescale problem of the original coreaccretion scenario. Instability to axisymmetric (ring-like) perturbations in a disk occurs
when the Toomre’s stability criterion is violated, i.e. Q = csκe/πGΣ ∼T 1/2Ω/Σ ∼
< 1 , where κe is the epicyclic frequency at some point in the disk (for
Keplerian orbits, the orbital and epicyclic frequencies are nearly the same whenever
the disk mass is small compared to the stellar mass), Σ ≈Md/r2 is the surface density,
H ∼cs/Ωis the disk vertical scale height and Md is the disc mass contained within
radius r. According to the Toomre criterion, the disk becomes unstable to its own gravity
whenever the stabilizing inﬂuence of diﬀerential rotation or pressure is insuﬃcient. Note
that this criterion is governed by the local density and is thus a local criterion for
fragmentation. In the nonlinear regime, global spiral waves develop for values of Q ≲1.3-
1.7 with a growth time of a few orbital periods. This solution involves spiral modes that
either saturate at low-amplitude via mode coupling, leading to rapid non-local angular
momentum redistribution restoring gravitational stability with no disk fragmentation
 , or fragment the disk. Estimates of disk surface densities and the fact that typically
H/r ∼0.1 for protostellar discs indicate that disks with Md ≲0.1 M⋆are usually stable
to GI. A disk, however, might become unstable during its evolution, for instance during
its formation, if mass builds up faster than it is accreted by the star or, at later times,
if the outer part of the disk, where stellar radiation is negligible, becomes suﬃciently
cool. For fragmentation to occur, however, the disk must cool quickly enough to avoid
entering a self-regulated phase, i.e. the disk cooling time tcool must satisfy the condition,
often called Gammie criterion, for very-thin disks tcool < ξ κ−1
e , with ξ ∼3 . Indeed,
the energy loss rate determines the eﬀect of the instability : isothermal disks, in which
energy is easily lost (and gained, in gas expansion) remain unstable and evolve violently
whereas adiabatic disks tend to heat up and become more stable.
Energy transport and dissipation processes are thus key issues to determine whether
or not planets can form from gravitational instabilities in a disk. A detailed analysis of
these conditions shows that planet formation by GIs can occur only in very massive

disks, Md ≳0.1 M⊙, at the very upper end of the observed distribution, and at large
orbital distances, a ≳100 AU. Even when vigorous convection occurs, it does not lower
tcool enough to lead to fragmentation . Note also that stellar irradiation tends to
hamper fragmentation.
An other key issue for planet formation by GI is the fate of the fragments. Even
if the disk cools fast enough for fragmentation to ocur, the fragments have to last
long enough to contract into planet embryos before being disrupted by tidal stresses,
collisions or shocks. Moreover, the typical mass scale associated with the fastest-growing
density perturbations in a disc undergoing GI, for H/r ∼0.1 and M⋆= 1 M⊙, is of the
order of a few Jupiter masses . An important question is whether such a fragment
can form a core since at such relatively high initial central temperatures, less than 1%
of the gas can condense into grains and one has to invoke eﬃcient sedimentation of
silicate and iron grains to the center during the early contraction phase to be consistent
with the enhanced heavy element abundances relative to solar values inferred for our
giant planets (see §2.1 and Tables 1-2). Therefore, it is far from clear that the peculiar
composition and structure of our jovian planets can be explained within the GI model.
Fragmentation by GI thus remains controversial, with markedly diﬀerent results from
various groups, and requires that the disk detailed thermal energetics are properly taken
into account (see e.g. for recent reviews).
3.3. Core-accretion versus gravitational instability
It is interesting to point out that disk instability predicts that even very young (≲1
Myr) stars should harbor gas giant planets, whereas the formation of such planets
with the core accretion scenario requires a few Myr. Observational searches for the
presence of genuine giant planets around ∼1 Myr-old stars will thus provide crucial
tests for the two formation scenarios¶. As mentioned above, determination of the heavy
element abundances of extrasolar planets also provides a deﬁnitive test: compositional
similarity of planets and their parent star would strongly favour gravitational collapse
whereas signiﬁcant heavy element enrichment of the planet with respect to the parent
star composition would rule it out.
The large heavy element enrichment inferred
for several transiting planets (see §2.2) clearly supports the core accretion model.
Last but not least, the eﬃciency of planet formation by GI should not depend on
the disk metallicity, since gravitational collapse from the protoplanetary disk is a
compositionally indiscriminating process, contrarily to the core-accretion scenario. The
observed clear dependence of planet frequency with the host star metallicity (see §2.2)
and the suggested trend that metal-depleted stars seem to harbor lower mass planets
(M sin(i) ≲1MJup), i.e the lack of massive planets around metal-poor stars and the fact
that stars hosting Neptune-mass planets seem to have a ﬂat metallicity distribution 
¶ For this test to be meaningful, it is crucial to identify the stellar companion as a genuine metalenriched planet, not as a brown dwarf of similar mass. Indeed, GI-induced fragmentation can occur
during the early (dynamical) stages of protostellar collapse and rapid disk accretion, but objects formed
by fragmentation in these cases are companion stars or brown dwarfs, not planets.
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
clearly suggest that metallicity plays a crucial role in planet formation, in agreement with
the core-accretion model. Furthermore, statistical analysis of null detections in direct
imaging surveys place constraints on the occurence of giant extrasolar planets around
FGKM stars. Calculations based on probability distributions derived from observed
mass and semi-major axis distributions of extrasolar planets , show that 4 MJup and
larger planets are found around less than 20% of stars beyond about 60 to 180 AUs,
depending on the planet theoretical models, i.e beyond the equivalent of extrasolar
Kuiper belts, at 95% conﬁdence level . Even though these calculations must
be taken with caution (they do not include the few detected large orbit planets) and
need to be conﬁrmed by more detailed statistical analysis, they suggest that extrasolar
giant planets at large separations ( >∼60 AU) are rare. This observational constraint,
combined with the statistical conclusion that the less massive the star the lower the
likelihood to host a giant planet (> 0.8 Mjup) and with the theoretical constraints
mentioned in §3.2, strongly weakens the GI model and reinforces the core accretion one.
This latter thus appears most likely as the dominant scenario for planet formation.
The recently detected 3-MJup object Fomalhaut-b at projected separations > 100
AU from the central star , and other similar discoveries, challenge planet formation
Although local formation by GI is not excluded , formation by core
accretion at shorter orbital distances remains a possibility, the planets having migrated
outwards under the action of either planet-planet scattering or resonant
interactions with an other planet in a common gap . GI-induced planet formation,
however, remains a plausible explanation in some peculiar situations, like for instance
for the planets recently discovered orbiting a double SdB-M dwarf system . In that
case, the circumbinary disk is likely to be massive enough to become unstable.
4. Interior structure properties
The impact of planetary internal compositions on their radius goes back to the
pioneering works of Zapolsky & Salpeter , who considered various zero-temperature
single element compositions, and to Stevenson for H/He, ice and rock planet
compositions. Modern calculations, although basically similar to these studies, present
improvements upon these works as they include modern equation of state (EOS)
calculations, notably for H/He, and accurate atmospheric boundary conditions, taking
into account irradiation from the parent star when necessary (see §6.3).
4.1. Thermodynamic properties
The mechanical structure and internal heat proﬁle of a planet are entirely determined
by the EOS of its chemical constituents. Indeed, due to eﬃcient convective transport,
the internal temperature proﬁle is quasi-adiabatic.
In the pressure-temperature (P-
T) domain characteristic of planet interiors, elements go from a molecular or atomic
state in the low-density outermost regions to an ionized, metallic one in the dense
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
inner parts, covering the regime of pressure-dissociation and ionization. Interactions
between molecules, atoms, ions and electrons are dominant and degeneracy eﬀects for
the electrons play a crucial role, making the derivation of an accurate EOS a challenging
task. We examine below our present knowledge in this domain.
Equation of state for H/He. The most widely used EOS to describe the
thermodynamics properties of the gaseous H/He envelope of giant planets is the Saumon-
Chabrier-VanHorn EOS (SCVH) .
This semi-analytical EOS recovers numerical
simulations and experimental results in the high-density and low-density regimes,
respectively, while, in its simplest form, interpolating over the pressure ionization regime.
Thanks to the growth of computational performances, the properties of dense hydrogen
can now be calculated from ﬁrst-principle or nearly ﬁrst-principle quantum mechanical
calculations. The last generation of these ab-initio calculations seem to converge towards
an agreement and to predict a substantially less compressible EOS for hydrogen, i.e.
predict a lower density for a given pressure, than SCVH in the pressure-ionization
domain, P ∼0.5-4 Mbar (see for a recent review of these EOS models).
bears signiﬁcant impact on the internal structure of giant planets, in particular the size
of the central core. A less compressible planet will tolerate less heavy material for a
given radius or, conversely, will have a larger radius for the same internal composition
Interestingly enough, high-pressure experiments on ﬂuid deuterium+ or helium are
now able to reach pressures and temperatures typical of the giant planet interiors (P ≳1
Mbar, T ≳104 K), probing the EOS in its most uncertain pressure-range.
experiments are dynamical, i.e. based on shock-driven compression. For a given initial
state of the sample, mass, energy and momentum conservation across the shock, as given
by the Rankine-Hugoniot relations, force the family of shocked states, which correspond
to diﬀerent shock velocities, to follow a Hugoniot curve in the (P, ρ, T) phase diagram.
Dissociation or ionization processes absorb the corresponding amounts of energy and
thus yield high degrees of compression with a modest temperature increase, whereas in
the absence of such processes the energy of the shock is expended mostly in the kinetic
degrees of freedom with a corresponding increase of temperature, following a diﬀerent
Hugoniot for the same initial state. Figure 3 portrays the phase diagram of hydrogen,
with the pressure range presently probed by high-pressure dynamical experiments on
H and He, together with Jupiter’s internal adiabat. Various experimental techniques,
however, give diﬀerent results, with a ∼30-50% diﬀerence in P(ρ) in the maximum
compression region for deuterium, ∼0.5-1.5 Mbar, although the most recent experiments
seem to converge towards the ”stiﬀ” (least compressible) Hugoniot result , in
agreement with the aforementioned quantum mechanical simulations (see for various
theory-experiment comparisons). This issue must be settled before hydrogen pressure
ionization can be considered as correctly understood.
+ Because of the higher density of deuterium compared with hydrogen, higher shock pressures can be
achieved experimentally for a given impactor speed.
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
For the less explored case of liquid helium, recent high-pressure experiments have
been achieved up to 2 Mbar for various Hugoniot initial conditions, allowing to test the
EOS over a relatively broad range. These experiments show a larger compressibility
than for hydrogen, due to electronic excitations and are in good agreement with the
SCVH EOS while ab-initio calculations underestimate the compressibility. Clearly
more of these experiments, exploring the so-called ”warm dense matter” domain, are
needed to fully assess the validity of the various EOS models, with a crucial impact on
our knowledge of the structure of Jovian planets (see §2.1).
The combined interactions of H and He in the mixture increase drastically the
degree of complexity in the characterization of the plasma. Not only the interactions
between the two ﬂuids will aﬀect the regime of pressure ionization compared with the
pure components, but partial immiscibility between the two species has been suggested
to explain Saturn’s excess luminosity for the age of the Solar System , and
may occur inside some exoplanets. A phase separation in the interior of a planet strongly
aﬀects its cooling history. Indeed, if H/He phase separation (or immiscibility of other
species with H) occurs in a planet’s interior, He-rich dropplets will form in a surrounding
H-rich ﬂuid and will sink to the planet’s center under the action of the gravity ﬁeld. This
extra source of gravitational energy converted into heat slows down the planet’s cooling,
or alternatively yields a larger luminosity for a given age. The strongest suggestion for
a phase separation in Jupiter or Saturn interiors comes from the observed depletion of
helium in their atmosphere, with a mass fraction Y = 0.238 ± 0.05 measured by the
Galileo probe for Jupiter, and a more uncertain determination, Y = 0.18-0.25 inferred
from Voyager observations for Saturn, to be compared with the protosolar nebula value,
Y = 0.275 .
Unfortunately, given the aforementioned diﬃculty in modelling the
properties of H or He alone, and the necessity to simulate a large enough number of
particles for the minor species (He in the present case) to obtain statistically converged
results, no reliable calculation of the H/He phase diagram can be claimed so far. As
mentioned above, pressure-ionization of pure hydrogen and helium must ﬁrst be fully
mastered before the reliability of the calculations exploring the behaviour of the mixture
can be unambiguously assessed∗.
Resolving these important issues concerning the H and He EOS must await (i)
unambiguous experimental conﬁrmation of the H and He EOS at high pressure, (ii)
unambiguous conﬁrmation of the reliability of the theoretical calculations, in particular
in the pressure ionization regime, (iii) guidance from experiments to predict the
behaviour of the H/He mixture under planetary interior conditions.
Progress both
on the experimental and theoretical side will hopefully enable us to fullﬁll these criteria
within the coming years (see section 9).
∗Note that the recent claim that H/He phase separation can not take place in Jupiter’s interior,
because metallisation of He should occur at lower pressure than previously expected, is not correct.
Although such a facilitated metallization (by itself a model-dependent result) could exclude the
suggested H+-He immiscibility , it does not preclude at all the H+-He++ one.

The physical properties of extrasolar planets
Equation of state for heavy elements. According to the composition of the
protosolar nebula, the next most abundant constituents after hydrogen and helium in
gaseous giant planets, but the most abundant ones in ice giants and Earth-like planets,
consist of C, N and O, often refered to as ”ices” under their molecule-bearing volatile
forms (H2O, the most abundant of these elements for solar C/O and N/O ratios, CH4,
NH3, CO, N2 and possibly CO2). The remaining constituents consist of silicates (Mg, Si
and O-rich material) and iron (as mixtures of more refractory elements under the form
of metal, oxyde, sulﬁde or substituting for Mg in the silicates). The behaviour of these
diﬀerent elements as a function of pressure, under the conditions typical of giant planet
interiors is not or poorly known. At very high pressure, the categorizations of gas, ice
and rock become meaningless and these elements should become a mixture of closed-shell
ions. The most widely used EOS models for such elements are ANEOS and SESAME
 , which describe the thermodynamic properties of water, ”rocks” (olivine (fosterite
Mg2SiO4) or dunite in ANEOS, a mixture of silicates and other heavy elements called
”drysand” in SESAME) and iron. These EOS consist of interpolations between existing
Hugoniot data at low to moderately high (≲0.5 Mbar) pressure and Thomas-Fermi
or more sophisticated ﬁrst-principle calculations at very high density (P ≳100 Mbar),
where ionized species dominate. Interpolation, however, provides no insight about the
correct structural and electronic properties of the element as a function of pressure, and
thus no information about its compressibility, ionization stage (thus conductibility), or
even its phase change, solid or liquid. All these properties can have a large impact on the
internal structure and the evolution of the planets. A detailed comparison between these
EOS, and the impact of the uncertainties on the radius determination for Neptune-like
and Jupiter-like planets has been conducted in . The largest diﬀerence between the
various EOS models, reaching up to ∼40-60% in P(ρ) and ∼10-15% on the entropy
S(P, T), occurs in the T ∼103-104 K, P ∼10−2-1 Mbar interpolated region, the typical
domain of Neptune-like planets . For these objects, such an uncertainty on the heavy
element EOS translates into a ∼10% uncertainty in the radius after 1 Gyr, and to larger
uncertainties at earlier ages (Fig. 3 of ).
For solids, the lattice structure energy dominates the thermal vibration (phonons)
contribution and, once the planet becomes cool enough for the core to become solid,
the thermal contribution of this latter to the cooling of the planet can be neglected.
This is not true at higher temperature, i.e. during the earlier stages of the planet’s
evolution, when the heavy elements are predicted to be in a liquid state, according to
their EOS. In that case, thermal eﬀects can substantially modify the zero-temperature
structure contribution and assuming a zero-T or low-T core, i.e. neglecting the core
release of thermal energy (dU/dt)core and gravitational energy (P dV
dt )core can drastically
underestimate its true gravothermal contribution, aﬀecting the general cooling of the
planet. The thermal contribution of the heavy elements to the cooling of the planet must
then properly be taken into account for a correct description of the planet’s evolution
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
4.2. Internal structure and composition
There is compelling evidence from our own solar system planets that they are
substantially enriched in heavy elements (C,N,O), with a ∼3 to ∼6 times solar value
for Jupiter and Saturn, respectively, and even larger contrasts for Uranus and Neptune
(see §2.1), as expected from a formation by core-accretion. This should apply as well
to the discovered exoplanets. Indeed, the small radii of some of the observed transiting
planets can only be reproduced if these objects are substantially enriched in heavy
material, with a total of several tens to hundreds of Earth masses. For all these objects,
including our own Jovian planets, however, uncertainties remain on (i) the total amount
of heavy material, (ii) the respective fractions of ”rocks” (silicates) and ”ices”, and (iii)
the distribution of this heavy material in the planet’s interior. As mentioned above, the
ﬁrst uncertainty (i) stems primarily from the present uncertainties on the various EOSs
and should decrease with further experimental and theoretical progress. Addressing the
two other issues necessitate to diﬀerentiate gaseous from solid/liquid planets.
Earth-like to super-Earth planets (≲10 M⊕) As discussed in §3, planets
below about 10 M⊕, usually denominated as super-Earth down to Earth-like planets,
are not massive enough to enter the unstable, run-away regime leading to rapid
accretion of a large gaseous envelope onto the central core. Post-formation degassing
or oxydization processes can only produce a teneous gaseous atmosphere, with no
signiﬁcant consequences for the planet’s contraction. Therefore, these objects consist
essentially of solids or liquids rather than gases, making their structure determination
from mass-radius observations less uncertain than for more massive planets (see below).
The mass-radius relationship for these low-mass planets has been parametrized as
R = Rref(M/ M⊕)β, with Rref = (1 + 0.56 α)R⊕and β = 0.262(1 −0.138 α), for the
rocky or ocean super-Earth planets in the mass range 1-10 M⊕( ), where α denotes
the water mass fraction, and β = 0.3 for planets between 10−2 to 1 M⊕, with a weak
dependence upon the iron to silicate ratio Fe/Si . Note that incompressible (constant
density) material corresponds to β = 1/3. These parametrizations appear to be rather
robust, despite the uncertainties in the EOS and in the iron/silicate fraction .
This provides a sound diagnostic for transiting Earth-like planet detections and the
possible identiﬁcation of the so-called ”ocean planets”, planets composed dominantly
of water , as opposed to the terrestrial (Fe-rich) planets.
As mentioned in
4.1.2, current uncertainties in the high-pressure behaviour of silicates, ices and iron
alloys prevent more precise information such as the detailed internal composition or
the size and the nature, solid or liquid, of the central core. Exploration of the iron
phase diagram and melting curve, in particular, a subject of prime importance for the
characterization of the Earth inner core, has become even more interesting since the
discovery of exoplanets of a few Earth masses (see §1) and the expected wealth of
transiting Earth-size planets with the Kepler mission ( ). While dynamic (Hugoniot)
experiments produce too large temperatures at the pressure of interest for the Earth,
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
they might become relevant for the super-Earth objects. This again points the need for
high-pressure experiments for planetary materials in the appropriate ≳103 K, > Mbar
4.2.2. Neptune-like to super-Jupiter planets (≳10 M⊕)
For planets with a ≳10% by
mass gaseous (H/He) envelope, this latter essentially governs the gravothermal evolution
of the planet. For instance, a 10 M⊕planet retaining a modest 10% H/He envelope is
50% larger than its pure icy counterpart .
Under such conditions, a variety
of internal compositions, either water-rich or iron-rich can produce the same massradius signature and detailed information about the planet’s internal structure,
other than inferring its bulk properties, becomes elusive. One of the main uncertainties
about the internal structure is that we do not know whether these heavy elements
are predominantly concentrated into a central core or are distributed more or less
homogeneously throughout the gaseous H/He envelope.
A summary of the main consequences of the uncertainties (i) in the EOS, (ii) in the
chemical composition and (iii) in the distribution of the heavy elements for planets with
masses ≳10 M⊕can be found in . In particular, show that for a global metal
enrichment Z ≳15%, all heavy material being either gathered in a core or distributed
homogeneously throughout the envelope yields a ≳10% diﬀerence in radius after 1 Gyr
for Neptune-mass planets and a ≳4% diﬀerence for Jovian-mass planets.
4.3. Energy transport properties
Giant planets The large radiative opacity of planetary material yields
completely ineﬃcient heat transport by photons, except in the most outer layers close
to the planet photosphere (see §5). Transport by conduction, resulting from collisions
during random motion of particles, may in some cases be relevant. In the central part
of H/He dominated planets, thermal conductivity is dominated by electronic transport
with conductivity κT ∼10−1 cm2 s−1 ( ). If no electrons are available, as in the outer
envelope, conductive transport is dominated by the less eﬃcient molecular motions with
thermal conductivity κT ∼10−2 cm2 s−1 ( ). Conduction by electrons (or eventually
phonons) may also dominate in central cores composed of heavy material (see ). But
the dominant energy transport mechanism in giant planet interiors is convection. Large
scale convection is extremely eﬃcient in transporting heat ( ) and the temperature
proﬁle is close to adiabatic. Superadiabaticity is extremely small, with ∇T −∇ad <∼10−8
in most of the interior♯. For H/He dominated planets, convective velocities derived from
the mixing length formalism vary between ∼10 cm s−1, in the central regions, and a
few 100 cm s−1 in the outer layers.
As initially stressed by , it is a conventional assumption in giant planet modelling
to postulate that their interiors are fully convective and thus homogeneously mixed.
This assumption has never been proven to be valid and has been questioned in the
♯∇T = d lnT/d lnP is the local temperature gradient and ∇ad = (dlnT/dlnP)S the adiabatic gradient.
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
case of our own giant planets by . As mentioned in §2.1, more recent models for
Uranus have also suggested the possible existence of non-homogeneous regions where
convection is not eﬃcient. If compositional gradients exist, convection can break into
convective layers separated by thin diﬀusive layers, the so-called double-diﬀusive or
layered convection, or, if layers do not persist, overstable modes of convection can lead to
the growth of small-scale ﬂuid oscillations, the so-called oscillatory convection, becoming
more alike an enhanced diﬀusion process than a large scale convective process .
Layered convection is known to occur in laboratory experiments and in some regions
of the Earth’s oceans or great lakes. In these conditions, the heat ﬂux transport is
signiﬁcantly reduced because of the presence of multiple diﬀusive layers. If this process
is present under conditions characteristic of giant planet interiors, heat transport in
the diﬀusive layers is due to conduction with above-mentioned thermal conductivities
( ). Because diﬀusion limits heat transport, the internal heat ﬂow of the planet is
signiﬁcantly reduced compared with that of a fully convective object. This may bear
important consequences on the planet structure and evolution, as discussed in §8.1,
slowing down its global cooling and contraction ( ).
Terrestrial exoplanets
Many eﬀorts are devoted to the modelling of massive
terrestrial planets, or super-Earths, essentially composed of heavy material, with a
negligible amount of gas. Simpliﬁed models have been developed in order to investigate
a wide range of compositions and masses ( ). These models involve simple internal
structures and compositions (see §4.2.1). They use zero- or uniform, low temperature
equations of state for the heavy material and thus do not consider the planet’s thermal
structure. Such simpliﬁed models are advocated on the basis that, so far, only exoplanet
bulk compositions can be inferred from mass and radius measurements, so that detailed
planet interior models are not necessary . In the future, however, internal structure
models reaching a degree of sophistication comparable to our own Earth’s description
might become required for terrestrial exoplanets. In this perspective, detailed models of
massive Earth or super-Earth analogs have been developed ( ). They rely on
our knowledge of the Earth’s internal structure, appropriately rescaled to super-Earth
masses. They involve layered internal structures with diﬀerent compositions and phase
changes, including an iron-rich core, lower and upper mantles composed of silicates and
an outer water layer (icy and/or liquid), as well as the related temperature proﬁles.
The eﬀect of large amounts of water, characterising the so-called ”ocean-planets”, on
the mass-radius relationships has also been investigated by . The thermal proﬁle is
constructed according to the Earth thermal structure, which is determined by convective
transport in each layer and is characterised by important variations at the interfaces.
According to , the thermal structure has little eﬀect on the radius of an Earth-like
planet but imposes conditions on the compositional phases, particularly for water at
the surface. This is of prime importance for the characterisation of ocean planets, in
order to know whether or not they can have a liquid water surface . Typical
terrestrial geological processes such as plate tectonics are now introduced in some exo-

Earth models, with the claim that this mode of convective transport mechanism might
be important for massive terrestrial planets ( ).
5. Atmospheric properties
The wide variety of planets both in and out of our solar system provide excellent
laboratories for understanding how atmospheres evolve with time and react to their
environments.
Atmospheres by themselves hold a nearly endless supply of complex
and interesting physical problems, but are also the primary link between observations
and theory.
The majority of observational techniques for studying planets involve
capturing photons that have emerged from the atmosphere, placing extreme importance
on our ability to successfully model atmospheric behavior. The grouping and location
of substellar mass objects (brown dwarfs and giant planets) on color-color and colormagnitude diagrams is largely due to the sculpting of the emergent spectrum by
atmospheric opacity sources.
Also, as already mentioned above, the atmosphere
regulates the release of energy from the interior and establishes the upper boundary
condition for interior models.
In the following sections, we discuss several of the
important aspects of atmosphere modelling.
5.1. Chemistry, Clouds, and Opacities
Chemistry is at the heart of most atmospheric phenomena and establishes the
distribution of the elements among various compounds. Among these compounds are the
primary opacity sources which in turn play key roles in the radiative transfer. Planetary
atmospheres are commonly assumed to be ideal gasses in chemical equilibrium. These
assumptions greatly simplify the determination of mole-fractions (or partial pressures)
of most compounds that, under these assumptions, depend only on temperature and
In principle, chemical equilibrium models are extremely simple and require the
solution of a set of coupled nonlinear equations (for mass and charge conservation and
including either equilibrium constants or chemical potentials).
There are, however,
practical considerations such as obtaining the necessary thermochemical data (speciﬁc
heat, entropy, enthalpy, etc.) of enough compounds to ultimately end up with a realistic
picture of the ensemble of chemical species.
One must also correctly handle phasetransitions that produce liquid and solid species, which may or may not remain aloft
in the atmosphere. Some of the ﬁrst chemical equilibrium models applied to gas giant
atmospheres were carried out for Jupiter and Saturn . Later, with the discovery
of brown dwarfs, a variety of chemical equilibrium models were explored .

189733) and a cool brown dwarf (of T spectral type) are shown in Fig.

carefully measured, while the brown dwarf and hot-Jupiter structures are theoretical
predictions (while accommodating most available observational constraints). Figure 5
compares the mole fractions (or equivalently the partial pressure divided by the total
pressure) for several of the most important molecules in a gas having the same element
abundances as the Sun. Molecular hydrogen and He are by far the dominant constituents
of the gas since H and He are orders of magnitude more abundant in the Universe than
any other element. The next three most abundant elements (C, N, and O) make up the
other dominant gas-phase molecules, H2O, CO, CH4, N2, and NH3. From Jupiter to a
hot-Jupiter, the atmospheric temperature range is in the thousands of Kelvin spanning a
regime where water ice can form (in the case of Jupiter) and where all the water is in the
gas phase. This broad temperature range also leads to a role reversal for CO and CH4
as the dominant carbon-bearing molecule. In Jupiter, equilibrium chemistry predicts
essentially no CO and nearly all of the carbon bound in CH4, while the reverse is true
for the hot-Jupiter. The brown dwarf has intermediate temperatures but is in the region
where water and methane are substantially more abundant than CO. Ammonia begins
to increase in concentration near the temperature found in the brown dwarf example,
and becomes increasingly important in the very low temperature atmospheres of Jupiter
and the other solar system giant planets.
At the low temperatures encountered in planetary atmospheres, phase transitions
can occur resulting in formation of liquid and solid “condensates”. The formation of
condensates substantially alters the overall gas phase mole fractions and, for example,

condense into ice with water clouds deep in the atmosphere (∼5 bar).
temperatures other perhaps less familiar condensates are expected to form involving
silicate grains and many other minerals (Fe, MgSiO3, Mg2SiO4, Al2O3 and so on). In
the presence of gravity and vertical/horizontal mixing, these condensates can potentially
form stable clouds or potentially sink completely out of the atmosphere, taking with
them elements that can no longer participate in the chemistry.
Including clouds in
atmosphere models is a signiﬁcant ongoing challenge and a variety of approaches are
being explored. Extreme limiting assumptions include either no clouds at all or clouds in
pure chemical equilibrium, resulting in thick clouds extending high up in the atmosphere.
More sophisticated models are used to explore the intermediate cases, many of which are
phenomenological in design, with the expectation that the important cloud properties
can be described by a manageable set of parameters with values ultimately determined
empirically. The cloud-model parameters most frequently used control cloud thickness,
particle size, and particle distribution. Alternatively, some models attempt to follow
the micro-physics of nucleation and grain growth coupled to mixing within the gas. So
far, no single model provides a comprehensive physical description of clouds. There is a
long history of cloud modelling for the giant planets in our Solar system and many
of these have inspired cloud models used for exoplanet atmospheres . Through the
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
study of brown dwarf atmospheres, a great deal has been learned about cloud formation
across a wide variety of low-temperature environments that can be directly applied to
exoplanet atmospheres.
For a review of competing cloud models, mostly applied to
brown dwarf atmospheres, see .
The importance of the chemistry and clouds are translated to the rest of the
model atmosphere via the opacities, either directly or indirectly. Opacity sources are
crudely divided up as either continuous (e.g., scattering, bound-free, or free-free), or
line opacities (atomic and molecular transitions) and the relative importance of these is
highly dependent on temperature and pressure as well as wavelength. The continuous
opacity sources are generally well characterized in atmosphere models; however, for
many grains, optical constants have either incomplete wavelength coverage or are not
available at all. Perhaps the most problematic source of opacity over the years has been
the molecular line opacity, where either the line data were simply not available or the
ability to include all of the necessary lines was computationally prohibitive (requiring
straight-means, K-coeﬃcients, or the “Just Overlapping Line Approximation” (JOLA)
to be used. For a description of these, see ). Modern computers are now quite capable
of include millions of spectral lines, and model atmospheres can now include all the line
data available to produce very realistic spectra.
Some of the biggest improvements
have been made in the completeness of line data for water vapor ( ). Other
molecules like CH4 still lack important line data at high temperatures (that are now very
important given the temperature ranges encountered in planetary atmosphere studies).
5.2. Irradiation Eﬀects
Of the more than 400 planets known, a third of these orbit their host star within 0.1 AU
and, thus, receive a substantial amount of energy from the star. This large number of
short period exoplanets is attributed to observational selection eﬀects but, nonetheless,
has greatly broadened our expectations for giant planets and in particular the conditions
present in their atmospheres. In most of these cases, the amount of extrinsic energy
received by the planet from the star greatly exceeds the energy leftover from the planet’s
formation that slowly leaks from the interior. Consequently, unlike longer period planets
and isolated brown dwarfs, the dominant energy source is a function of the orbital
separation and the spectral type of the host star and is less dependent on an exoplanet’s
mass and age (except for very young planets).
The incident ﬂux can be deﬁned by the following equation, where R⋆and T⋆are
the host star radius and eﬀective temperature, and α ∈[1/4, 1] is a scaling factor used
to crudely account for day-to-night energy redistribution.
Since exoplanets are found with a wide range of eccentricities, the general (timedependent) planet-star separation is given by,
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
1 + e cos θ(t),
where a is the semi-major axis, e is the eccentricity, and θ(t) is the angle swept out by
the planet during an orbit.
The atmospheric temperature of isolated stars (and of widely separated planets and
brown dwarfs) is often described by a single characteristic temperature, the so called
eﬀective temperature, Teff, deﬁned such that σT 4
eff equals the total energy per unit area
radiated from the surface. A similar characteristic temperature is useful for describing
the temperature of irradiated planets, however, it is customarily called the equilibrium
temperature (Teq) to avoid confusion with the internal (Tint) eﬀective temperature which
is a measure of the energy contribution from the interior. Since energy is conserved,
a planet in equilibrium must reradiate the energy it receives from the star along with
the energy escaping the planet’s interior. Thus the equilibrium eﬀective temperature is
int + (1 −A)Finc,
where A is the bond albedo.
As one would expect, the extrinsic ﬂux heats the dayside of giant planet
atmospheres to temperatures well above those found in our Solar System.
predicted temperature structure of HD189733b (Fig.
4) illustrates this point.
intrinsic ﬂux of this planet is very close to that of Jupiter, while the predicted
temperatures across the dayside atmosphere are entirely maintained by stellar heating.
The discovery of the ﬁrst hot-exoplanet, 51 Peg b, inspired many predictions for the
properties of irradiated planetary atmospheres with each of
these early works employing simplifying assumptions ranging from ad hoc temperature
structures, artiﬁcial upper/lower boundary conditions, and sparse chemistry and opacity
descriptions. Despite simplifying assumptions, these early models successfully predicted
many of the fundamental properties now revealed by observations and paved the way
for more detailed models.
More sophisticated 1-D models including state-of-the art
chemical and radiative transfer simulations have been explored for a broad range
of hot-exoplanet atmospheres, and have demonstrated the diversity and complexity
one should expect in hot-Jupiter atmospheres, both chemically and spectroscopically
 .
Early on, it was clear that traditional 1-D model atmospheres faced a geometric
problem concerning the natural division of a hot-exoplanet into day and night sides.
Many of the short-period planets should be synchronously rotating (see §7), ensuring
that the planet is irradiated constantly on the same hemisphere. This of course was
not a new problem as stellar and planetary atmosphere modelers have been dealing
with this issue for decades earlier. In many ways, the situation is far more similar to
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
what is often encountered in irradiated stellar atmospheres since the expected day-night
temperature diﬀerences for hot-exoplanets greatly exceeds what one ﬁnds in the Solar
System (assuming hydrostatic and radiative-convective equilibrium).
The frequently
used approach is to model the two sides (day and night) separately and scale the incident
ﬂux by a geometric factor (α in the equations above) to account for the redistribution
(or lack of) of absorbed stellar ﬂux across either the day side or the entire atmosphere.
The value of this global redistribution factor has only recently been estimated
using observations in a few cases and more sophisticated 3-D dynamical simulations
are needed to predict wind speeds and horizontal heat transport.
Early 3-D global
circulation models found that wind speeds could exceed 1 km s−1 and that daynight temperature diﬀerences of 500K were possible at photospheric depths (i.e. the
spectrum forming region). These authors also stressed that dynamics has consequences
for the chemistry, potentially leading to observable departures from equilibrium (see
below). Diﬀerent approaches have been used to model the circulation patterns in hotexoplanets, including 2-D and 3-D models, most of
these motivated by varying successes within the Solar system planets. To accommodate
the computational expense of following multi-D global circulations, these models make
various levels of sacriﬁces when it comes to the radiative transfer in the atmosphere
models. There still remains a substantial disconnect between the 1-D static atmosphere
models with sophisticated radiative transfer and the multi-D global hydrodynamical
models; however, eﬀorts are underway to bring the two together . While these
circulations models diﬀer in the details (some have large vortices like the spots on
Jupiter, while others have single dominant westward jets), most agree that strongly
irradiated planets will develop a small number of broad ﬂows/jets . This diﬀers
from the Solar System planets which have numerous narrow jets. See for a recent
detailed review of exoplanet circulation models.
5.2.1. Albedo
Observational upper limits on the reﬂected starlight of hot-Jupiters yield
a rather small value for the geometric albedo.
None of the attempts to detect the
reﬂected light from the ground during secondary eclipses has been successful so far.
Space-based photometric observations of HD209458b at visible wavelengths are the most
constraining upper limit so far, and give a value less than 0.17 at 99.5% conﬁdence level
 , signiﬁcantly smaller than Jupiter’s value of 0.5. These observations suggest that
most of the incident starlight of a hot-Jupiter, at least for HD209458b-like conditions,
is absorbed, ruling out the presence of many reﬂective clouds in this type of object.
Further observations on a large sample of transiting planets are necessary in order to
obtain more stringent information about the albedos and the atmospheric properties of
these objects.
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
5.3. Non-equilibrium Chemistry
Departures from equilibrium chemistry can occur for a variety of reasons, such as
non-local phenomena (external radiation) and time-dependent mixing (vertical and/or
horizontal).
For example it is believed that enhanced tropospheric CO in Jupiter’s
atmosphere is due to rapid vertical mixing and very slow chemical reaction timescales
to convert CO back to CH4. Similar mixing-induced equilibrium departures are thought
to occur in the atmosphere of brown dwarfs (e.g. Gl 229B), impacting both the CO/CH4
ratios and the N2/NH3 ratios.
The (net) chemical reactions responsible for converting CO to CH4 and N2 to NH3
−→CH4 + H2O,
The individual times (τchem) for the two reactions above are very long, from left to right,
at low temperatures and pressures (often greater than 106 years) compared to vertical
upwelling, which operates on year timescales or less. In both planetary and brown dwarf
atmospheres the true mixing timescales (τmix) in the radiative layers are highly uncertain
and often approximated as τmix ∼H2/Kzz, where H is the pressure scale height and
Kzz is the eddy diﬀusion coeﬃcient – a free parameter ranging from 102 to 105 cm2
s−1 (see for more details). When τmix >> τchem, the chemistry is expected to be
in equilibrium. All other reaction pathways involving important opacity sources occur
very rapidly and, thus, are not expected to be perturbed from equilibrium by mixing.
See for applications of this procedure to brown dwarf atmospheres and
 for CO in Jupiter’s atmosphere.
As already mentioned above, global circulations can lead to horizontal/vertical
mixing and cause departures from equilibrium chemistry. In many of the hot-Jupiters
large mole fractions of CO can persist even in cool regions (P <∼1bar) where chemical
equilibrium predicts CH4 as the dominant carbon bearing molecule in a manner very
similar to that described above for brown dwarf atmospheres . Looking back at
Fig. 5, mixing is expected to elevate the CO mole fractions at low pressures (P <∼1
bar) by many orders of magnitude above the chemical equilibrium curves shown. NH3
could also be an order of magnitude below the equilibrium value through much of the
atmospheres shown. Photochemistry driven by external irradiation has been studied
extensively in Solar System planets (see for a review) but has only been studied in
close-in giant exoplanets for a few speciﬁc cases . Also, a new ﬁeld develops with
the study of photochemistry of Earth-like atmospheres, one of the motivation being the
analysis of ”false positive” signals of life due to photochemistry ( , see below).
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
5.4. Biosignatures
No Earth analogs have been yet detected, but their search is one of the major goal
of ground- and space-based research programs of the coming decades.
Our current
understanding of planet formation suggests that terrestrial planet formation should be
an eﬃcient process. We thus expect these planets to be common, as illustrated by our
Solar System which has three such planets (Earth, Mars and Venus). The search for
signatures of life on exo-Earths is one of the main motivations for these programs and
certainly one of the most exciting scientiﬁc inquiry of the beginning of the century. A
huge activity is now devoted to astrobiology and we will only mention in this review the
most basic biosignatures currently suggested. Biogeochemical activity on a planet could
manifest itself through spectral features of the atmosphere. Current search strategies,
as derived for DARWIN/TPF ( ), are thus based on the spectroscopic detection of
compounds that could not be present on a planet in the absence of life. The search
for biomarkers is based on the assumption that extraterrestrial life shares fundamental
characteristics with life on Earth. This later is based on carbon chemistry and requires
liquid water as solvent. Other paths for life, based on a diﬀerent chemistry, could perhaps
exist but the signatures of the resulting life-forms are so far unknown. The need for
liquid water leads to the concept of Habitable Zone deﬁned as the region around a
star where the surface temperature of Earth-like planets allows the presence of liquid
water (see Fig. 6). This zone depends on the stellar luminosity and thus evolves in
time with the star. Its deﬁnition also depends on complex processes on the planet,
such as the concentration of greenhouse gases or geological activity (see and
references therein). Any biomarker should include the signature of H2O, which is a
requisite for ”earth-like” life. The presence of H2O, O2 (or O3) and CH4, NH3 or CO2
would imply some biological activity, so that these elements are considered as favourite
biomakers ( ). However, as pointed by , the unique detection of one of
these compounds may be ambiguous. Indeed, O2, and hence O3, can be produced by
photochemistry. The combined detection of O2 with H2O and CO2, which are important
for habitability, would however provide a robust signature of biological photosynthesis
( ). Similarly, the presence of CH4 or NH3 together with O2 or O3 would be
good biomarkers (see and reference therein), as demonstrated by the observations
of the Galileo probe, as it passed near the Earth and detected simultaneously O2 and CH4
( ). Note that methane and ammonia are not expected to be abiotically produced on
habitable, Earth-size planets, in contrast to a common production in cold hydrogen-rich
atmospheres of giant planets (see §5.1 and Fig. 7). The analysis of biological spectral
signatures on an exoplanet is thus optimised if its physical properties, such as its mass
and radius, can be also determined.

6. Evolutionary properties
6.1. Basics of evolutionary models
Planetary evolution is described by the standard conservation equations, written in a
spherically symmetric conﬁguration and widely used in stellar evolution calculations
( ). The complete evolutionary problem requires the coupling between interior (see
§4) and atmospheric (see §5) structures.
The rate at which internal heat escapes
depends on the surface properties, and thus on the outer boundary conditions connecting
interior and atmospheric structures. Modern models for planets incorporate realistic
atmospheric boundary conditions using frequency dependent atmosphere codes as
described in §5. This is required for a correct description of the thermal proﬁle and
eﬀective temperature of objects having cold molecular atmospheres ( ).
inner and outer temperature-proﬁles are connected at large optical depths, where
either the atmosphere becomes fully convective or radiative transport only involves
Rosseland mean opacity, which is a weighted mean over all frequencies of the inverse
monochromatic opacity κν using the temperature derivative of the Planck distribution
as weighting function (see ). The connection is done either at ﬁxed pressure, usually
at a few bars ( ) or at ﬁxed optical depth, usually at τRosseland = 100 ( ).
The numerical radius, corresponding to the outer boundary condition, provides to an
excellent approximation the planet’s photospheric radius, where the bulk of the ﬂux
escapes (τRosseland ∼1). This stems from the negligible atmospheric extension between
the photosphere and the depth characteristic of the outer boundary conditions.
6.2. Initial conditions
Planet evolution is characterised by the release of gravitational and internal energy
from an initial (unknown !) entropy state. The usual procedure, similar to the brown
dwarf and stellar cases, assumes a high initial entropy state, i.e. a large initial radius
and luminosity . Since this implies a relatively small (≲Myr) Kelvin-
Helmholtz timescale, this yields a rapid early evolution so that the initial conditions are
forgotten within a few Myr and do not inﬂuence the subsequent evolution . The
assumption of a hot initial state for planets has recently been questioned by . Using
initial conditions derived from the core-accretion model, they ﬁnd lower initial entropy
states than aforementioned. These authors thus suggest that young giant planets should
be fainter and smaller than predicted by standard evolutionary models, and thus fainter
and smaller than young brown dwarfs at the same age. Although based on the planet
embryo’s core-accretion history rather than on a totally arbitrary initial condition, this
approach, however, still suﬀers from the lack of a proper treatment of the ﬁnal accretion
shock, which determines the nascent planet’s initial energy content and radius (see
§3.1). The results of are a direct consequence of the assumption that the accreting
gas loses most of its internal entropy through the shock. Such assumption is derived
from the shock boundary conditions of , which were initially developed for the
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
study of accretion onto protostars.
Multi-D radiative transfer and hydrodynamical
simulations of the accretion process and the resulting shock could provide more rigorous
post-shock initial conditions for young planet models. Although still very challenging,
this level of complexity seems to be required in order to improve the ﬁeld. Therefore,
the determination of the planet initial conditions remains so far an unsolved issue, as
discussed in .
Such a high sensitivity of early planet evolution to initial conditions, as previously
stressed for low mass stars and brown dwarfs , has major consequences on the
identiﬁcation of planetary mass objects in young clusters and on detection strategies of
future projects such as SPHERE and Gemini Planet Imager. The work of also raises
the question whether the faintness of young planetary mass objects may be used as a
criterion to distinguish a brown dwarf from a planet. The answer is non trivial but one
must keep in mind that accretion through a disk (circumstellar or circumplanetary) is a
common process of both star and planet formation. Moreover, the conclusion that young
planets should be faint relies on a treatment of accretion which can also be applied to the
formation of protostars and proto-brown dwarfs (see and §3). Thus, for the same
reasons, brown dwarfs may as well be fainter than predicted by current evolutionary
6.3. Cooling and contraction history
A planet contracts and cools down during its entire life on a characteristic thermal
timescale τKH ∼GM2
RL . For a 1 MJup gaseous planet, τKH ∼107 yr at the beginning of
its evolution, starting from a hot initial state with luminosity L > 1028 erg s−1, and
τKH > 1010 yr after 1 Gyr, reaching luminosities L <∼1025 erg s−1 (see ). As
mentioned in §2.2, a non-negligible fraction of exoplanets are at close distance from
their parent star and their evolution is aﬀected by irradiation eﬀects. These eﬀects are
accounted for through the coupling of interior and irradiated atmosphere structures (see
§5). The heating of the outer layers by the incident stellar ﬂux yields an isothermal layer
between the top of the convective zone and the region where the stellar ﬂux is absorbed.
The top of the convective zone is displaced toward larger depths, compared to the nonirradiated case. The main eﬀect is to reduce the heat loss from the planet’s interior,
which can maintain higher entropy for longer time.
Consequently, the gravitational
contraction of an irradiated planet is slowed down compared to the non-irradiated case
and the upshot is a larger radius at a given age. This eﬀect is illustrated in Fig. 8 on
the evolution of a 1 MJup planet.
For Saturn and Jupiter mass planets with orbital distances 0.02-0.045 AU, the
typical eﬀect of irradiation on the radius is about 10%-20% ( ). Since
the total binding energy and the intrinsic luminosity of a planet decreases with its
mass, the lighter the planet, the smaller the ratio of its intrinsic ﬂux to a given incident
stellar ﬂux. Consequently, the evolution and radius of a Neptune-like or smaller planet
will be signiﬁcantly more altered by irradiation eﬀects, compared to the non-irradiated
The physical properties of extrasolar planets

counterpart, than for a more massive planet at a given orbital distance (see §6.4 and
Fig. 9). Irradiation eﬀects are thus quantitatively important and must be accounted
for in the modern theory of exoplanet evolution.
Furthermore, a consistent comparison between theoretical radius and observed
transit radius requires a subtlety due to the thickness of the planet atmosphere
( ). The measured radius is a transit radius at a given wavelength, usually
in the optical, which involves atmospheric layers above the photosphere. Atmospheric
extension due to heating of the incident stellar ﬂux can be signiﬁcant, yielding a
measured radius larger than the theoretical or photospheric radius.
This eﬀect can
add a few % (up to 10%) to the measured radius ( ).
Inspection of transiting object mean densities suggests that some exoplanets, like
the giant planets of our Solar System, are enriched in heavy material. Models devoted to
the analysis of their properties must then account for such enrichment. Many eﬀorts are
now devoted to the construction of models, covering a wide range of masses, including
(i) diﬀerent amounts of heavy elements and (ii) diﬀerent heavy material compositions
( ). Exploration of eﬀect (ii) is limited by available equations of
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
state valid under conditions encountered in planetary interiors (see §4.1.2). The most
commonly considered materials are water, rock and iron. For sake of simplicity, and
given the currently large uncertainties on EOSs, on the nature of the heavy elements and
on their distribution inside the planet, current models often assume that heavy materials
are all contained in a central core. A detailed analysis of the main uncertainties in
current planetary models, due to EOS, composition and distribution of heavy material
within the planet has been conducted in (see §4.2.2). As shown in Fig. 8, the radius
of a heavy material enriched planet is smaller, at a given time, compared to the H/He
gaseous counterpart.
Figure 8 also illustrates the competitive eﬀects of irradiation,
which increases R, and of the presence of heavy material, which diminishes R.
6.4. Mass-radius relationship
The mass-radius relationship of a planet at a given time of its evolution is entirely
determined by the thermodynamic properties of its internal constituents and its ability
to transport and evacuate its internal entropy content. Figure 9 portrays the behavior of
the mass-radius relationship of Earth-like to Jupiter-like planets. The essential physics
characteristic of the shape of the relation was described in the pioneer work by . Two
competitive eﬀects yield the well-known ﬂattening in the M −R relationship around a
few MJup. In the low mass regime, down to Earth masses, the dominant electrostatic
contribution from the classical ions yields a relation R ∝M+1/3, characteristic of
incompressible matter. As mass and density increase, the eﬀects of partially degenerate
electrons start to dominate over Coulomb eﬀects, yielding a reversal of the M −R
relation. Consequently, a maximum radius exists at a critical mass which depends on
the planet composition.
 found a critical mass of 2.6 MJup, corresponding to a
maximum radius of ∼1 RJup, for a gaseous H/He planet under the assumption of zerotemperature plasma. More recent calculations, based on improved EOS as described in
§4.1, yield a critical mass ∼3MJup.
Figure 9 also illustrates the increasing eﬀect of irradiation on the planetary radius
as mass decreases for planets retaining a substantial atmosphere (see §6.3). The radius
of a 20 M⊕planet with 50% H2O is enhanced by ∼35% if irradiated by a Sun at 0.045
AU ( ). For terrestrial planets, the mass-radius relationship derived from detailed
models assuming the same complex composition as for the Earth ( , see §4.2.1) are
shown by the long-dashed line in Fig.
As discussed in §4.3.2, these predictions
are extremely close to the one derived from more simple models, assuming 100% rock
( ). High accuracy (less than 5%) on radius measurement, and to a lesser extent on
mass measurement, is thus required to infer the detailed composition of a super-Earth
exoplanet ( ). As shown by , if the uncertainty on the radius of a
super-Earth planet is less than 3%, the amount of water can be determined with an
accuracy of less than 13%.

7. Star-planet interaction. Tidal eﬀects
7.1. Star-planet orbital parameters.
The geometry of an orbiting star-planet system of respective masses M⋆and Mp,
illustrating the formation and dynamical evolution of the system, is encapsulated in
three main parameters: the semi-major axis a, associated with the mean orbital motion,
n = 2π/P ≃(GM⋆/a3)1/2 where P is the orbital period and G the gravitational
constant, the eccentricity e and the stellar obliquity ǫ, deﬁned as the angle between
the angular momentum vectors of the planetary orbit and the stellar rotation axis. This
latter quantity, which determines the spin-orbit angle, is an interesting diagnostic for
inferring the dominant interaction mechanisms at play in a protoplanetary disk: close
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
spin-orbit alignment (as is the case for our solar system) is expected from quiescent tidal
interactions or migration processes of a planet within the disk whereas planet scattering
events are prone to misalignments of planetary orbit angular momentum and stellar spins
 . The inclination angle of the orbit relative to the sky plane is usually denoted i
so that the line-of-sight projected value of a quantity retains a sin i indetermination.
A transit observation implies that i ∼900. Although the stellar obliquity is generally
not measurable, Doppler shift observations on the parent star throughout a transit oﬀer
the possibility to determine the angle between the sky projections of the two angular
momentum vectors, i.e. the projected spin-orbit angle λ, which gives a lower limit of
the true three-dimensional spin-orbit angle††. The angle λ is determined through the
so-called Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) spectroscopic eﬀect , originally applied
to eclipsing binaries and recently extended to transiting planets (see
 for recent reviews on RM observations). To date, the RM eﬀect has been
measured for 12 transiting systems. For nine of these systems, the determinations are
consistent with a small (≲3o) or even zero-value of λ, although with signiﬁcant error bars
in some cases, indicative of well-aligned spin and orbit, similar to the solar system, even
though one should keep in mind that these observations provide minimum (projected)
values of the true stellar obliquity, as mentioned above. Alignment of the stellar spin
and the planetary orbital axis is a strong conﬁrmation of planets forming in a spinning
protoplanetary disk surrounding the central protostar. Spin-orbit misalignment, on the
other hand, as found for the HD17156 , XO-3 and WASP-14 systems,
can be produced by planet scattering or Kozai mechanism due to the presence of a
third body (e.g. ). Interestingly, this spin-orbit alignment shows that the star’s
axis of rotation and the orbit angular momentum evolution are not signiﬁcantly altered
during the early episodes of angular momentum loss characterized by outﬂows and diskstar magnetic coupling. A less frequently addressed tidal parameter is the planetary
obliquity, i.e. the angle between the planetary spin axis and the orbit normal. Although
the planet’s obliquity is expected to be rapidly damped by tidal dissipation, a persistent
nonzero planet obliquity has been suggested as a result of the capture in a Cassini
2 spin-orbit resonance state as the nebula dissipates .
This scenario, however,
has been excluded for hot-Jupiter-like planets .
Indeed, the resonant
equilibrium is eventually destroyed by the strong tidal torque, leading the system to
leave the Cassini 2 state and spiral towards the Cassini 1 state, with negligible obliquity
 . Therefore, close-in planets quickly evolve to a state with the planet’s spin axis
nearly normal to the orbit plane, i.e. a negligibly small planet obliquity. Note that the
determination of stellar companion’s obliquities would provide an interesting diagnostic
to distinguish planets from brown dwarf companions, these latter being formed from
††Since the orbit of transiting planets is nearly edge-on, the angle λ is related to the true stellar
obliquity ǫ by cos ǫ ≃cos λ sin i⋆, where i⋆is the inclination of the stellar rotation axis relative to the
sky plane . Note that for transiting systems, the projected spin-orbit alignment angle can be zero
while the stellar obliquity is 900 if the angle i⋆between the stellar rotation and the line-of-sight is also

the same original gravoturbulent collapse of the parent cloud as the star, leading to
arbitrary spin angle distributions.
7.2. Orbital evolution
For close planets, gravitational interactions between the planet and the star lead each of
these bodies to raise tides on the other one, generating torques in the tidal bulges.
Through exchange of angular momentum, these strong tidal interactions aﬀect the
system orbital (eccentricity, semi-major axis, obliquity) and rotational (stellar and
planetary spin, ω⋆, ωp) properties.
In the ﬁrst calculations addressing tidal eﬀects
in the discovered extrasolar close-in star-planet systems , coplanarization of
the orbit and the stellar equator (i.e. stellar spin-orbit alignment), planet spin-orbit
alignment, circularization of the orbit and synchronization of the stellar and planetary
rotation with the orbital motion were implicitly assumed to represent the asymptotic
equilibrium states, characteristic of the endpoint of tidal evolution, although the orbit
might be unstable, leading eventually to star-planet merging . Accordingly, the
associated timescales were generally characterized by an exponential relaxation towards
an equilibrium state . Furthermore, in the calculations of , only tides
raised by the star on the planet were considered whereas tides raised by the planet on
the star were ignored. A proper derivation of the evolution of all orbital and rotational
parameters, however, requires to solve consistently the complete non-linear coupled tidal
equations, taking both the planetary and the stellar tides into account.
tides raised in the star transfer angular momentum between the star’s rotation and
the planet’s orbit, so that, in the presence of stellar tides, the planet’s orbital angular
momentum is not conserved during the tidal evolution, even if the planet’s rotation
is synchronized.
Such consistent calculations lead to markedly diﬀerent dynamical
evolutions with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent rotational and orbital evolution timescales, and
thus diﬀerent eccentricity values from the ones obtained when neglecting stellar tides
 .
As mentioned above, most of the early studies implicitly assumed the existence
of a tidal (possibly unstable) minimum energy equilibrium state at given angular
momentum for the orbiting planets, characterized by circular orbits (for the stable state),
synchronous rotation and spin-orbit alignment.
However, as demonstrated recently
 , none but one, namely Hat-P-2b, of the transiting planets discovered at this time
(26 objects) has such an equilibrium state. Indeed, for all these systems, the total starplanet angular momentum, Ltot, is lower than the critical angular momentum deﬁned
M⋆+Mp(Ip + I⋆)
, where Ip and I⋆denote the polar moments of inertia
of the planet and the star, respectively. Consequently, no equilibrium state exists and
all these planets will ultimately merge with the star . This result does not
depend on any particular tidal model and bears major consequences on our analysis of the
discovered transiting systems and, possibly, of the non-transiting ones too. First of all,
it implies that the conventional tidal exponential damping estimates for the timescales
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
for semi-major axis evolution, synchronization of the spins and spin-orbit alignment
are not valid, because the implied corresponding equilibrium states do not represent the
endpoint of the tidal evolution. The full tidal calculations, taking into account the strong
nonlinear coupling between e, a, ǫ, ω⋆and ωp show that the timescales characteristic of
the semi-major axis and the stellar spin and obliquity evolution of these systems are now
comparable, and equal to the lifetime of the system itself . These quantities are
found to evolve only moderately from their initial values, until they quickly go to zero
or diverge during the ﬁnal merging episode with the host star, the true endpoint of the
tidal evolution for these systems. The only exception is the pseudo-synchronization of
the planet’s rotational velocity with the orbital motion, such as ωp ∼n, which occurs on
a timescale comparable to the one estimated with the equilibrium tide theory, ∼105-106
yr for hot-Jupiter typical parameters :

p is the planet’s moment of inertia (α ≈0.25 for Jupiter), Γp = 3
the amplitude of the torque exerted by the star on the planet, Pd the orbital period in
days and Q′ = Q/k, where Qp (resp. Q⋆) denotes the planet (resp. star) tidal quality
factor. This latter is deﬁned as the ratio of the maximum potential energy stored in the
tidal distortion over the energy dissipated per tidal period, roughly equal to the inverse of
the tidal phase lag associated to the (equilibrium) tidal oscillation in the body of interest
(e.g. ), and k denotes the star or planet second order Love number, representative
of the body’s deformability (typical values of the Love number for Sun-like stars and for
Jupiter are k⊙≈0.02 and kJup ≈0.38, respectively, although with large uncertainties).
This quick planet pseudo-synchronisation stems from the fact that the planet’s rotation
angular momentum is much smaller than the orbital angular momentum. This state,
however, corresponds to a temporary state, as the ultimate planet-star orbital collapse
eventually causes the planet to spin up dramatically . Once the planet is pseudosynchronized, there is no further exchange of angular momentum between its rotation
and its orbit; the only exchange occurs between the orbit, the eccentricity and the stellar
rotation at constant total orbital angular momentum. These quantities are also modiﬁed
by the tides raised by the star on the planet, in case of a non-zero eccentricity, and by
the tides raised by the planet on the star even when/if the orbit is circularized.
This lack of tidal equilibrium state for the transiting systems bears other important
consequences. First of all, it implies that, even for a circular orbit (e = 0), ongoing
tidal dissipation keeps taking place in the star, leading, by conservation of angular
momentum, to the planet’s endless orbital decay and, inevitably, to a merging of the
planet with the star. It also means that stellar spin synchronization with the orbit can
never occur for these systems, since, once the planet is pseudo-synchronized, the tidal
torque raised by the planet onto the star yields this latter to spin up constantly (indeed,
for n ≫ω⋆, energy is transferred from the orbit to the spin ), the stellar spin

evolving within the same timescale as the orbital distance. Decrease of stellar rotation
velocity with time due either to stellar winds or magnetic braking may counteract this
tidal spin-up. Strong stellar wind episodes, however, mainly occur at the early stages of
evolution and these eﬀects are probably unimportant at the age of the observed systems.
Magnetic braking is a more complex issue and is found to compensate or even dominate
tidal spin-up if Q′
⋆≳108 for OGLE-TR-56b, the presently discovered extrasolar giant
planet closest to its parent star .
As mentioned above, a proper determination of the various timescales, including
the lifetime of the system, i.e. the time for the planet to merge with its host star (or
more exactly to reach the Roche Lobe limit, a ∼2.5 (ρ⋆/ρp)1/3R⋆), requires to solve
consistently the complete non linear coupled dynamical equations for a, e, ǫ, ωp and
ω⋆. No analytical solution exists. In the limit of small eccentricity (e ≪1) and for
Mp ≪M⋆, however, the timescale for orbital evolution is dominated by the tides in the
star †. In that case, providing that the orbital period is much shorter
than the stellar rotation period (ω⋆≪ωorb = 2π/P), a fulﬁlled condition for most of the
observed transits (Prot,⋆∼3-70 days whereas P ≲4 days (see e.g. Table I of )), and
that the stellar obliquity is small (also a generally fulﬁlled condition), the orbit evolution
timescale, given by the inverse ratio of the torque exerted by the planet on the star over
the orbital angular momentum, can be estimated as (e.g. )
Mpa2n)−1 ≈0.06 ( Q′
)(a/0.02 AU
≈0.05 ( Q′
)5/3 P 13/3
Note that this timescale quickly decreases with ﬁnite eccentricity since tidal eﬀects
increase drastically at the apside . We stress again that eqn.(7) is only a rough
estimate and that the proper determination of the orbit evolution requires a consistent
solution of the full tidal equations.
Moreover, the true calculation of the timescale
depends to some extent on the used tidal model.
Eqn.(7), however, provides some
useful information.
Since indeed, at very small eccentricity, τa only depends on (or
more exactly is dominated by) tidal dissipation within the star, not within the planet,
as seen from eqn.(7), a ﬁrst consequence of this equation is that, for hot-Jupiter like
τa ≲⟨τ⋆⟩∼10 Gyr ⇒P ≲3.4 ( Q′

where ⟨τ⋆⟩is the average value of the lifetime of stars harboring planets (∼10 Gyr for
solar-type stars). Therefore, although all the planets for which Ltot < Lc will merge with
† As mentioned in , even though only the outermost layers of solar-type stars are convective and
dissipate eﬃciently, ultimately the convective and radiative zones will synchronize and dissipation will
occur throughout the entire star. This will aﬀect the timescale for tidal evolution, but this latter will
qualitatively remain the same.

all, the more massive the planet, the faster the orbital decay and thus the shorter
the system’s lifetime, which may partly explain the lack of hot-Jupiters for P ≲3
d . Second of all, for a given orbital distance and comparable stellar
masses, small transiting planets should be discovered around older systems, a trend
which seems to be supported by observations . The often used assumption
that tidal evolution is always dominated by tides raised by the star in the planet leads
to the opposite behaviour. Conversely, as seen from eqn.(7), the determination of the age
of the system from the age of the host star provides a constraint on the minimum value
for Q⋆. As mentioned earlier, for observed transiting planets, the orbital period is shorter
than the stellar rotation period, so that tidal dissipation in the central body (the star
in the present context) decreases the orbital semi-major axis (˙a < 0), by conservation of
total angular momentum. This is similar for instance to the Mars-Phobos system but
contrasts with the Earth-Moon one. In this latter case, the Moon revolution period is
longer than the Earth rotation one so that tidal dissipation in the Earth leads to an
increase of the Earth-Moon distance.
As for the orbital evolution timescale, there is no simple analytical solution for the
orbit circularization timescale, τe, and one needs to solve the whole dynamical equation
One can try, however, to estimate τe, as done above for τa.
The rate of
eccentricity decay reads
where τe,p and τe,⋆denote the characteristic timescales associated with the contributions
steming from the tides raised by the star in the planet and by the planet in the star,
respectively. It can easily be shown (e.g. ) that (for zero stellar obliquity)
It can be veriﬁed that, for the majority of the presently observed transit planets, τe,p

torque exerted by the star on the planet. In that case, the orbit circularization timescale
can be estimated as:

The physical properties of extrasolar planets
As seen from eqns.(7) and (11) (and as expected from the fact that τe,⋆∼τa for e ≪1),
the ratio of the orbital and circularization timescales in the limit of small eccentricity

tidal damping may explain the circularization of initially eccentric orbits.
calculations solving the complete tidal dynamical equations show that tidal dissipation
for short-period planets may have produced the present eccentricities from larger
initial values similar to the longer period planet eccentricity distribution, providing
an explanation for the smaller eccentricity (e ≲0.3, ⟨e⟩∼0.1) of short-period (a ≲0.2
AU) planets compared with more remote ones (e ≲0.9, ⟨e⟩∼0.3), depending on the
values of Q′
p . For Q′
⋆≳10, however, the orbit does not
have time to circularize within the lifetime of the system . In such cases, there
is no need to invoke undetected companions to maintain the eccentricity. Note that
a value e=0 is often assumed when constraining the orbital parameters by inferring a
solution for (a, e) from the observed light curves in ﬁtting the orbits of close-in planets.
Eccentricity values for short-period planets should thus be taken with caution.
Integrating the complete coupled tidal evolution equations back in time from present
eccentricity and orbital values‡ may provide some clues about the initial eccentricity
distribution of exoplanets, at the end of their formation process, and thus about the
outcome of planet-disk interactions.
Numerous Lindblad or corotation resonances
take place between a disk and a planet, exerting torques which deposit or remove
angular momentum from the resonance locations. This modiﬁes the planet’s eccentricity
during the disk evolution .
The net eﬀect of these disk-planet interactions on
the eccentricity, however, remains uncertain, and it is not clear whether eccentricity is
damped or excited, with possibly both solutions being valid depending on the disk and
planet properties . To ﬁrst order, however, the eccentricity evolution due to disk
torques is ˙e ∝1/√a , so it is expected that short period planets are more aﬀected
than the ones located further away. Planets could thus form with ﬁnite eccentricities,
damped either by interactions with the disk or by tidal interactions after the disk
dissipation for the low eccentricity objects. On the other hand, large initial eccentricities
can be produced by planet-planet scattering or gravitational perturbations by a stellar
companion .
As discussed in the next subsection, the orbital and rotational evolution timescales,
however, can not be determined accurately, as they depend on the ill-determined tidal
forcing and dissipation processes, as well as on the internal structure of the star and the
planet (radiative envelope, presence of a dense core, etc...), which translates into values
of Q uncertain by several orders of magnitude.
‡ Present attempts to address this issue do not consider the evolution of the stellar spin
and use tidal equations truncated at the order e2, only valid for small eccentricity values, and thus
yield quantitatively unreliable results.
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
7.3. Tidal energy dissipation
If the planet’s orbit is circular, the tidal bulge is motionless in the planet’s frame and
there is no energy release. In the case of a maintained ﬁnite eccentricity or obliquity,
however, the persisting tidal friction leads to energy dissipation in the planet, at the
expense of the orbital and rotational energies.
If the tidal heating induced in the
planet by tidal dissipation dominates the planet’s main sources of energy, gravothermal
contraction and solar irradiation, about 1025 erg s−1 for typical Gyr-old hot-Jupiters
(i.e. ∼1 MJup at ∼0.05 AU from a Sun-like star) and lasts over a timescale comparable
to the planet’s thermal timescale, this extra source of energy will slow down the planet’s
contraction, leading to a larger radius (and luminosity) at a given age than otherwise
expected. At second order in eccentricity (i.e. in the limit e ≪1), the tidal dissipation
rate in a pseudo-synchronously rotating (ωp ≃n) planet with zero obliquity is given, at
given a and e, by (e.g. ):
≈−5.2 × 1027 ( Q′
106)−1 ( M⋆
(Rp/RJup)5
(a/0.05 AU)15/2 e2 erg s−1,
where the terms of orbital evolution only include the contributions due to the planetary
tides, since we are presently interested in the energy dissipated in the planet. Tidal
dissipation has been proposed to explain the abnormally large radii of some transiting
planets . As mentioned earlier, however, these estimates of orbital decay timescales
were ignoring the stellar tides, leading to incorrect tidal dissipation rates.
consequence, eccentricity and tidal dissipation were found to be negligible at the age of
the presently observed transiting planets, and hypothesis like continuous gravitational
interactions from undetected companions had to be invoked to maintain a ﬁnite
eccentricity.
Only recently have correct tidal evolution calculations been conducted
to quantify this eﬀect . As mentioned earlier, the
coupled tidal equations taking both star and planet tides into account yield signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent timescales for the evolution of the orbital and rotational properties, with a nonmonotonic evolution for the evolution of the eccentricity, semi-major axis and stellar
spin, as well as for the tidal heating, and this latter can provide in some cases a signiﬁcant
enough source of energy to alter the cooling properties of the planet at a few Gyrs.
For tidal energy dissipation to signiﬁcantly aﬀect the contraction and thus the
radius of the planet, however, tidal heat must be deposited deep in the convective layers.
Turbulent viscosity (characteristic of what is usually refered to as ”equilibrium tide”)
may lead to dissipation of heat at depth . However, for the planets of interest,
the convection turnover time exceeds the tidal period, so that convective dissipation is
probably too slow to be eﬃcient in short-period planets as well as in their host stars
 . Excited short wavelength g-modes (characteristic of ”dynamical tides”) at
the interface between convective and radiative zones would dissipate within the
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
radiative region, since g-modes do not propagate in isentropic regions, only aﬀecting the
outermost parts of irradiated planets. An interesting alternative mechanism in rapidly
rotating planets might be short-wavelength, low-frequency inertial waves, restored by
Coriolis rather than buoyancy forces, excited at the envelope-core boundary in the
central parts of the planet.
These waves can propagate and might dissipate in the
convective inner regions and are thus more prone to aﬀect the planet’s structure than
the aforementioned gravity modes . In that case, the tidal quality factor
is found to depend on the orbital period and core size as Q′ ∝R−5
c P 2 .
discussed above after eqn.(7), the inferred age of the systems implies that Q′
⋆can not be
substantially smaller than the nominal values Q′
⋆≈105-106. The same holds true for Q′
Indeed, most of the transiting planets are predicted to have a core whose state remains
uncertain (see §4.1.2). A solid core implies a much lower quality factor, Q′
core ∼102-103,
than for a ﬂuid or gaseous body, i.e. a more dissipative planetary interior, which in
turn increases the expected tidal dissipation (dEtide/dt ∝1/Q′
p). The eccentricity of
Io’s orbit, however, implies that 6×104 ≲QJup ≲2×106 . Moreover, as mentioned
above, if inertial waves are the main culprit for tidal energy dissipation, Q′
p is predicted
to be of the order of ∼106 for Jupiter (Io’s orbital period is P = 1.77 d) and ∼107-108
for hot Jupiters (P ∼3-4 d). This suggests that the jovian planet cores may have
melted, under the action of the violent accretion episodes during the formation or of
tidal heating during the evolution.
Besides the gravitational tides mentioned in this section, it is worth mentioning
the possibility for short-period, strongly irradiated planets to experience thermal tides
 . Thermal tides arise from the torque exerted by the stellar gravitational ﬁeld on
the thermal bulge produced in the planet’s outer layers by the stellar time-dependent
insolation. In that case, an equilibrium state in which gravitational and thermal tide
eﬀects balance each other can be reached, leading to asynchronous spin and/or possibly
to ﬁnite eccentricity. This process, however, has been shown not to be valid in the case
of gaseous bodies since, in the absence of a surface crust, the torque exerted on the
thermal bulge vanishes .
8. Observational constraints
8.1. The radius anomaly of transiting exoplanets
As mentioned in §2.2 a signiﬁcant fraction of transiting exoplanets exhibits abnormally
large radii (see Fig. 2). This puzzling property is one of the most titillating observational
discoveries in this new ﬁeld and still requires a robust explanation. Several ideas have
been proposed, as described below, but none of them has yet received a consensus.
Atmospheric circulation As mentioned in §6.3, close-in planets receive a
substantial amount of energy from the star. The resulting heating of the outer planet
layers aﬀects the vertical temperature stratiﬁcation and, consequently, the planet’s

evolution and thus radius at a given age, as described in §6.3. This eﬀect, however,
is insuﬃcient to explain observed radii >∼1.2 RJup.
Irradiation can also modify the
horizontal temperature proﬁle.
Indeed, if the planet is tidally locked and receives
constantly the stellar ﬂux on the same hemisphere, strong temperature contrasts can
exist between the day- and night-sides of the planet, inducing rapid atmospheric
circulation (see §5). The resulting fast winds may produce a heating mechanism in the
deep interior of the planet, slowing down its evolution and yielding a larger than expected
radius. This suggestion was based on numerical simulations of atmospheric circulation
by , which produce a downward ﬂux of kinetic energy of about ∼1% of the absorbed
stellar ﬂux. This heat ﬂux is supposed to dissipate in the deep interior, producing an
extra source of energy during the planet’s evolution. According to these simulations, this
mechanism yields a typical heating rate of 1027 erg s−1, which can explain the inﬂated
radius of hot Jupiters like HD209458b ( . The validity of this scenario, however,
is still debated. The substantial transport of kinetic energy found in the simulations
of strongly depends on the details of atmospheric circulation models and has not
been conﬁrmed by other simulations ( ). Although important eﬀorts are devoted to
the development of multi-D dynamical simulations of strongly irradiated atmospheres
(see §5), the various simulations so far yield very diﬀerent results ( ). Furthermore,
as demonstrated by , a proper description of the physical mechanisms responsible
for energy dissipation and drag in the ﬂow (e.g., shocks, turbulence) is mandatory to
obtain reliable descriptions of heat redistribution and wind speeds across irradiated
exoplanetary atmospheres.
Assuming this mechanism is at play in all close-in planets, and arbitrarily adding
an extra-source of energy corresponding to 0.5% ×Finc, ﬁnd a correlation between
the mass of heavy elements required to ﬁt the transit radii and the metallicity of the
parent star. This result, however, is highly speculative, since it crucially depends on
the aforementioned assumption of a constant fraction of Finc.
If this wind-induced
mechanism is at play in all close-in planets, one expects a correlation between the planet
radius ”excess”, deﬁned as the relative diﬀerence between the observed radius Robs and
the theoretical radius Rth obtained with regular irradiated models,
incident stellar ﬂux Finc, normalised to the planet’s intrinsic ﬂux Fint =
dt dm, where S is the speciﬁc entropy of the irradiated planet. This relation
is illustrated in Fig. 10 for a handful of transiting systems. Whether the expected trend
exists or not is not clear, in particular when considering the fact that WASP-12’s large
radius may be explained by tidal heating, as mentioned in §8.1.2 below. Clearly, a more
detailed analysis, extended to all transiting planets, is required to explore this issue.
To summarize, although atmospheric circulation remains an attractive possibility
to explain the ”hot-Jupiter” radius anomaly, a robust conﬁrmation of this mechanism,
in particular of heat transport at deep enough levels to aﬀect the internal adiabat, is
needed, based on more sophisticated numerical simulations. It should also be noted
that planets far enough from their host star ( >∼0.1 AU) should not be aﬀected by this
mechanism, a diagnostic eventually testable with the Kepler mission.

, where Robs is the observed radius
and Rth is the predicted radius of the planet at the age of the system. The error bars
on the radius correspond to the quoted observational values.
8.1.2. Tidal eﬀects
Following , several studies have suggested tidal heating as a
possible mechanism to explain inﬂated transiting planets (see §7.3). A heating rate of
the order of 1027 erg s−1, consistent with the tidal dissipation rate given in eqn.(13)
and about 100 times the typical intrinsic energy ﬂux of hot-Jupiters, dissipated in the
planet’s convective interior over appropriate timescales could in principle explain the
observed abnormally large radii for at least some coreless planets. The presence of a
central core yields a smaller radius and thus requires a larger energy rate. As discussed
in §7.3, the ﬁrst calculations ( ) exploring the eﬀect of tidal dissipation were based on
incorrect tidal evolution timescales and assumed constant orbital properties over time.
The correct impact of tidal dissipation on the planet radii from their supposed initial
semi-major axis and eccentricity, taking into account the opposite eﬀects of decreasing
a and e on the tidal dissipation rate ˙E along the evolution (see eqn.(13)) has been
explored only recently , although under some restrictive conditions (see
second footnote in §7.2). In some cases, this heat source is found to be substantial at
the age of the system, possibly aﬀecting the planet’s contraction and helping solving the
radius discrepancies, assuming tidal dissipation occurs deep in the convective interiors
The physical properties of extrasolar planets

function of the tidal dissipation contribution (see eqn.(13)), assuming constant values
for a and e, at the age of the system. A value Q
p = 106 is assumed for the planet’s
tidal quality factor. Objects shown with a left arrow have a (measured or assumed)
eccentricity e ≤0.01, and their tidal dissipation is calculated here assuming e = 0.01.
(see discussion in §7.3).
As shown in Fig.
11, WASP-12 experiences extreme tidal
heating, which may explain its strikingly large radius (see ). Tidal heating due
to ﬁnite eccentricity, however, does not seem to be the lacking dominant mechanism
responsible for all the observed abnormally large radii. Indeed, as illustrated in Fig.11
(see also ), there is no obvious correlation between abnormally inﬂated planets
and tidal dissipation energy. Tres-4, for instance, experiences a tidal heating comparable
to its internal energy rate, even though being notably inﬂated (see ). However,
proper calculations of the complete (not truncated at a given eccentricity order and
including the rotational energy) tidal evolution equations remain to be done to fully
address this issue.
An other source of tidal heating can arise if the orbit is inclined relative to the
stellar quadrupole, so that the planet makes a vertical oscillation in the quadrupole
ﬁeld of the star once per orbit. This eﬀect, however, has been shown to be utterly
negligible . Finally, as mentioned in §7.3, thermal tides can not be maintained in
gaseous planets and thus can not provide an extra source of heat .
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
8.1.3. Atmospheric enhanced opacities
A possibility to slow down the contraction of
a self-gravitating body and to obtain a larger radius at a given age is to increase the
atmospheric opacities.
This solution was recently suggested by to explain the
puzzling large radii of some transiting planets. Alteration of atmospheric properties
(chemistry, clouds, opacities) by strong optical and UV irradiation or enhanced
atmospheric metallicities are suggested as the source of the increased opacities, although
the authors do not work out the physical processes that could possibly lead to such an
increase. In order to mimic the eﬀect of enhanced opacities, they assume supersolar
atmospheric metallicities (up to 10 times solar).
The combined eﬀects of enhanced
opacities and of the presence of a dense core is found to reproduce the observed radius
spread of transiting planets (see Fig.
Interestingly enough, also ﬁnds the
same correlation as suggested by between planet core mass and stellar metallicity.
Although enhancement of the atmospheric opacities of irradiated extrasolar planets is by
no means excluded, given our limited knowledge of the various physical processes at play
in such situations, the results obtained by , based on the increase of atmospheric
metallicities, remain questionable. First of all, similar consistent calculations by 
yield a smaller radius for the planet, as the larger mean molecular weight due to the
increased metallicity counterbalances and even dominates the slower contraction due to
the enhanced opacities. Second of all, although signiﬁcant heavy element enrichment
is observed in the atmosphere of our Solar System giant planets (see §2.1), convective
transport in these (cool) planets is predicted to occur all the way up to the atmosphere,
constantly bringing up heavy material to the atmospheric layers.
Irradiated planet
atmospheres are radiatively stable down to deep levels. To maintain heavy elements
high up in these stably stratiﬁed outer layers requires a (yet to be worked out) eﬃcient
mechanism to counteract gravitational settling. More importantly, a stratiﬁcation with
heavy elements on top of a (lighter) H/He envelope, as done in has been shown to
be unstable, leading to ”salt-ﬁngers” instabilities . The eﬀect of strong irradiation,
altering the chemistry and cloud properties requires additional work, as pointed out by
the authors themselves . Therefore, although enhanced atmospheric opacities in
strongly irradiated planets is a possibility, it requires more robust physical foundations
to be considered as the source of the abnormally large radii of irradiated planets. In
any event, even such super-solar metallicity models cannot explain the most inﬂated
transiting planets presently detected, like Tres-4b and WASP-12, implying the need for
one or several alternative mechanisms ( ).
Reduced interior heat transport The idea of Stevenson that convection may
not be as eﬃcient as usually assumed in planetary interiors was resumed and applied
to the case of exoplanets by .
These authors show that conditions prevailing
in giant planet interiors could be favourable to the development of double-diﬀusive
(layered) or oscillatory convection, if a molecular weight gradient is present (see 4.3).
With characteristic Prandtl number (i.e. the ratio of kinematic viscosity over thermal
diﬀusivity), Pr ∼10−2-1, and inverse Lewis number, deﬁned as the ratio of solute to
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
thermal diﬀusivity, Le−1 ∼10−2, conditions in planets are not too diﬀerent from those
found on Earth. Indeed, double-diﬀusive convection, characterised by the formation of
multiple thin diﬀusive layers surrounded by (small-scale) convective regions, is a well
known process in laboratory experiments, or in some parts of oceans and salty lakes,
where the stabilizing gradient is due to salinity (the so-called thermohaline convection),
with characteristic numbers Pr =7 and Le−1 = 10−2 for salty water . The presence
of a molecular weight gradient in the interior of giant planets could be inherited from
the formation process, during the accretion of gas and planetesimals, or due to core
Assuming a molecular weight gradient in the inner parts of a Jupiter-like
planet, show that if multiple layers can form, they might survive long enough to
aﬀect substantially the planet evolution. Heat transport by layered convection is indeed
much less eﬃcient than large-scale convection and the heat escape from the hot, deep
parts of the planet is signiﬁcantly reduced. The upshot is a larger planet at a given age
than its homogeneous, adiabatic counterpart ( ). Depending on the number of layers
and the steepness of the molecular weight, the presence of this process could explain
the observed spread in transit planet radii.
If conﬁrmed, this scenario would bear
important consequences on our general understanding of planetary internal structure.
High spatial resolution multi-dimensional numerical simulations, which are progressing
at a remarkable pace, might be able in a foreseeable future to conﬁrm or to reject the
existence of layered or oscillatory convection under planetary conditions. Note that,
according to this scenario, one should not expect any correlation between the radius
and the incident ﬂux, contrarily to other suggested mechanisms like the atmospheric
circulation outlined in §8.1.1.
8.2. Brown dwarfs versus massive giant planets
As underlined in §1, brown dwarfs and planets overlap in mass. Observations of low
mass stars and brown dwarfs in young clusters suggest a continuous mass function
down to ∼6 MJup, indicating that very low mass objects form as an extension of the
star formation process . There is indeed strong observational support for the brown
dwarf formation process to be similar to the stellar one , and analytical theories
of star formation from the gravoturbulent collapse of a parent cloud do produce protobrown dwarf cores in adequate numbers compared with the observationally determined
mass spectrum .
In parallel, the discovery of ”super” Jupiter-mass
objects > 10 MJup orbiting a central star (see Fig.
12) emphasizes the need for
identiﬁcation criteria enabling the distinction between a brown dwarf and a planet.
Radii signiﬁcantly smaller than predictions for solar or nearly-solar metallicity objects
would reveal the presence of a signiﬁcant amount of heavy material, an unambiguous
signature of planetary formation process. The case of the 8 Jupiter mass transiting
planet HAT-P-2b (or HD147506b, ) is interesting in this context, as its radius is
consistent with the presence of a signiﬁcant amount of heavy elements ( >∼10% in mass
fraction) and cannot be reproduced by a solar metallicity brown dwarf model ( ),

as illustrated in Fig. 12. If conﬁrmed, HAT-P-2b might be the illustration that planets
can form by core accretion up to a least 8 times the mass of Jupiter.
The nature
of CoRoT-Exo-3b, a ∼21 MJup object orbiting an F3V type star ( ), however,
remains ambiguous, given the present uncertainties on the radius determination ( ).
Enhanced metallicity is also expected to leave its mark on the atmospheric properties of
a planet and may provide signatures of its formation process in a proto-planetary disk.
However, abundance patterns in the cool atmospheres of planets and brown dwarfs may
be severely aﬀected by diﬀerent complex processes (non-equilibrium chemistry, cloud
formation, photochemistry, see §5). Predictions are thus uncertain and determination
of clear spectral diagnostics requires much additional work before they can be used to
distinguish a planet from a brown dwarf (see ).
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
8.3. Hot Neptunes and evaporation process
About twenty planets with masses less than ∼20 M⊕have been discovered by
radial velocity surveys. Since these small planets are at the detection threshold, this
number is relatively large, indicating that they should be rather common.
of their low mass, their presence at close distance from their parent star raises the
question about their origin. Observational evidences that close-in planets may undergo
signiﬁcant evaporation process ( ) gave rise to the idea that hot-Neptunes may have
formed from more massive progenitors and have lost a substantial amount of their
gaseous envelope ( ). This idea and the interpretation, in terms of evaporation,
of the observations of are currently controversial ( ).
Preliminary models
of evaporation for hot-Jupiters induced by the stellar XUV radiation predicted large
evaporation rates which could signiﬁcantly aﬀect the planet evolution ( ). More
recent theoretical works based on improved treatment of atmospheric escape now
reach diﬀerent conclusions and ﬁnd much smaller rates than predicted just after the
observations of (see and references therein).
Small evaporation rates are
also consistent with the observed mass function of exoplanets ( ).
Furthermore,
formation models based on the core-accretion scenario can easily produce hot-Neptunes
composed of a large core of heavy material without the accumulation of a substantial
gaseous envelope ( ). Their existence can thus be explained without the
need to invoke strong evaporation processes. Getting the ﬁnal word requires (i) more
statistics in the low planetary mass regime, (ii) conﬁrmation of the observations and
interpretation of and (iii) improved models of evaporation of close-in planets.
Independently of these issues, the interior properties of hot-Neptune planets were
recently revealed by the discovery of GJ 436b ( ) and HAT-P-11b ( ), two
transiting planets of ∼22 M⊕and ∼26 M⊕, respectively.
They are remarkably
analogous to Uranus and Neptune, in terms of heavy material content, with a radius
indicating heavy element enrichment greater than 85%. For GJ 436b, models with ∼20
M⊕core of ice or rock and a gaseous H/He envelope of ∼2 M⊕reproduce its observed
radius ( ). HAT-P-11b also appears to be a super-Neptune planet with ∼90% heavy
element and ∼10% H/He envelope (see Fig. 14 of ). Given current uncertainties
on the modelling of planetary interior structures, only their bulk composition can be
inferred, and the total amount of heavy material, its composition and distribution within
the planet cannot be accurately determined.
As mentioned in §4.1.2 and shown in
 , the thermal contribution of heavy elements to the cooling of Neptune-like planets
signiﬁcantly aﬀects their evolution and thus radius at a given age. The discovery of
GJ436b and HAT-P-11b conﬁrms the large heavy element content that can be expected
in planets, comforting our general understanding of planet formation through the core
accretion model. However, since there is no obvious signature of an evaporation process
on the structure of a planet, current observations cannot certify whether or not these
hot-Neptunes have undergone strong evaporation episodes during their evolution.

8.4. Light of extra-solar planets
So far, exoplanets have only been discovered by indirect techniques, without actually
direct photon detection from the planet.
Various claimed direct detections cannot
unambiguously assess the very nature of the observed object, brown dwarf or planet. The
recent detections of the 3-MJup planet Fomalhaut-b and of the young (30 to 160 Myr
old) triple system orbiting HR 8799 , however, represent exciting discoveries and,
if coplanarity of the system is clearly demonstrated for the second case, might indeed
be the ﬁrst genuine direct detections of exoplanets. Somewhat counter intuitively, the
short period hot-Jupiters were the ﬁrst class of exoplanets to have their atmospheric
properties measured, both photometrically and spectroscopically; a major contribution
made possible with the Spitzer Space Telescope .
The majority of Spitzer
exoplanet observations target transiting EGPs orbiting nearby stars. As a transiting
planet disappears behind its star, there is an observable drop in the total ﬂux from the
system as the planet’s contribution is temporarily absent. This event is often called the
secondary eclipse, and the depth of the eclipse is a direct measure of the planet-star
ﬂux ratio (e.g. Fig 13). The orbital phase coverage of these Spitzer data conﬁne them
to measuring the temperature and chemistry of a planet’s day side only.
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
planet-star ﬂux ratio is the quantity measured, secondary eclipses depths increase with
increasing wavelength roughly in accordance with the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation,
resulting in deep eclipse amplitudes even at wavelengths where the planet ﬂux is quite
Figure 14 compares the full set of secondary eclipse ﬂux measurements for
HD189733b to dayside model spectra with uniform global redistribution of absorbed
stellar ﬂux (α = 0.25) and dayside-only redistribution (α = 0.5).
In this example,
there is a transition between 2 and 3 µm from one case to the other, suggesting depthdependent energy redistribution, probably caused by horizontal ﬂows over a narrow
range of pressures .
The anticipated diversity in hot-Jupiters is beginning to emerge from secondary
eclipse observations with hints that some hot-jupiters have temperature inversions
across their photospheres (HD209458b and TrES-4) while others may not (HD189733b).
Temperature inversions can be produced by a variety of processes, for example, the
presence of a high-atmosphere opacity source could produce strong heating at low
pressures. Plausible opacity sources could be the molecules TiO and VO which can
play an important role in shaping the atmospheric structures . However it has
shown that an identiﬁable opacity source can produce a temperature inversion deep
(high pressure) enough to reach the photosphere and impact the IR ﬂuxes. Alternatively,
strong horizontal currents could cool deeper layers while leaving layers above still quite
hot resulting in a fairly deep inversion . The exact nature of the inversion
and its cause will require observations of higher precision and across a broader range
of hot-Jupiters. Spitzer ﬂux measurements have also started to identify those planets
that have strong or weak day-to-night redistribution of absorbed stellar energy leading
to cold or warm night side temperatures. Observations covering a large fraction of an
orbital period can provide potential maps of the atmospheric temperatures allowing
tests of global circulation models . In one example, HD189733b, the hottest
location of the atmosphere (measured at 8 µm) is actually not located at the substellar
point but instead leads the sub-stellar point by 2 to 3 hrs (i.e. down wind by 20 to 60◦)
– as roughly predicted by global circulation models . For a more comprehensive
review of Spizer exoplanet observations see .
Ground-based secondary eclipse observations at K- and L-bands are being
attempted by several groups and, so far, only upper limits have been obtained
 . These near-IR ﬂux upper limits, however, can be extremely useful
for estimating the level of day-to-night redistribution since, in many cases, the peak
of the energy distribution for hot-exoplanets is actually in the near-IR, rather than at
wavelengths covered by Spitzer. As demonstrated by the question of redistribution
is fundamentally a bolometric argument and measuring the ﬂuxes at multiple band
passes including shorter wavelengths is critical for determining the true day-to-night
ﬂux redistribution.
As a transiting planet passes between Earth and the host star, the wavelengthdependent opacities in the planet’s atmosphere obscure stellar light at diﬀerent planet

radii, leading to a primary transit eclipse with a wavelength-dependent amplitude.
Spectroscopic observations during primary transit (called transit spectroscopy) can
measure planet radii across various absorption features from which atomic and molecular
mole fractions can be inferred.
There have been a number of models for EGP
transmission spectra , all using 1-D plane-parallel
or spherically symmetric geometry and a single 1-D temperature-pressure proﬁle to
represent the depth-dependent (radial) structure.
The broad Na and K doublets
in the optical were predicted to produce large radius variations .
Subsequent
observations using the STIS instrument on board HST detected the Na doublet ( ),
though it was much weaker than predicted, prompting speculations about high clouds
and photoionization .
Following the Na detection, an extended hydrogen
atmosphere surrounding HD209458b was discovered using transit spectroscopy in the
UV at Lyman-α . At Lyman-α wavelengths, HD209458b is ∼3 times larger than
at optical wavelengths. The extended atmosphere may also contain carbon and oxygen
as reported by .
Strong water absorption (Fig.
15) was identiﬁed in the HD
209458b STIS data and later in emission on the dayside with secondary eclipse
Spitzer observations . A marginal detection of water in HD189733 b was made
with Spitzer in the IR and later detected at much higher conﬁdence (along with
methane) with NICMOS on board HST . Ground-based observations have also
successfully repeated the Na detection in HD209458 b , and have actually resolved
the doublet into its two components for HD189733 b .

Horizontal bars
correspond to mean radii across bins with λ-ranges indicated by the width of each
bar. Observations are shown with 1-σ error-bars .
Higher up in the atmosphere, at lower pressures and densities, global circulation
patterns become ineﬃcient at redistributing heat and the temperatures are likely close to
their radiative equilibrium values. Under radiative equilibrium, there will be signiﬁcant
horizontal temperature variations caused by diﬀerent incident angles of incoming
radiation from the host star. Furthermore, the photoionization of species like sodium
and potassium has been shown to be very important for modelling the transmitted
spectrum . Given the transparency of the upper limb, photoionization (and
potentially more complicated photochemistry) may also spill over to the night side.
Consequently, independent of the global circulation, there will be horizontal structure
that is not likely well reproduced in a 1D model of the transmitted spectrum. Eﬀorts to
model this region in 3 dimensions are underway and should greatly improve our ability
to use transit spectroscopy to infer upper-atmospheric properties of hot-Jupiters.
9. The future
The next decades promise a wealth of discoveries and new knowledge in the ﬁeld of
exoplanets.
Our understanding of exoplanet properties will progress with expected
developments on experimental and theoretical fronts. Ongoing and future high-pressure
experiments in various national laboratories (Livermore and Sandia in the US, LIL
and Laser Mega-Joule laser projects in France) and advancements of ﬁrst principle Nbody numerical methods (DFT, path-integral, quantum molecular dynamics) promise
substantial progress on EOS in the critical pressure regime of 0.1-10 Mbar, characteristic
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
of H and He pressure ionization, and at temperatures typical of planetary interiors.
The question of internal heat transport, and its eﬃciency in the presence of molecular
weight gradients, may receive an answer from current progress in high-resolution multi-D
numerical simulations. Numerical tools, such as the one developed by and devoted
to high resolution stellar radiative hydrodynamical simulations, using grid reﬁnement
methods and high-order spatial schemes, oﬀer promising techniques to handle this
problem. The future study of exoplanet atmospheres is also poised for great progress
in the coming years. Coupled multi-D radiation hydrodynamical simulations are in the
works, and new and improved opacity databases are emerging. Our understanding of
clouds and chemistry (much of which comes from studying brown dwarf atmospheres)
is steadily improving.
From the observational standpoint, a multitude of missions based on diﬀerent
techniques and wavelengths will provide a wealth of data.
The combination of all
these techniques deﬁnes eﬃcient strategies for the detection and characterization of
exoplanets, as highlighted by the impressive prospective work by . Current and
future space-based surveys, like CoRoT and Kepler, will signiﬁcantly increase the
number of know transiting systems.
These two space missions may soon answer to
the question whether Earth analogs, in terms of mass and size, exist in the Habitable
Zone. A large number of additional transiting planets will also emerge in the next years
from ongoing ground-based wide-ﬁeld surveys as HATnet, TrES or WASP. Increasing
the number of detections will allow a more comprehensive study of exoplanet physical
properties (mass-radius relationship, bulk composition, abnormal radii, etc..) and will
conﬁrm (or not) current observed trends, placing them on ﬁrmer statistical footing.
CoRoT is expected to ﬁnd many tens of transiting giant planets and could discover a
few tens (10-40) of super-Earths. CoRoT recently announced the detection of the very
ﬁrst transiting super-Earth candidate (still to be conﬁrmed at the time of this writing),
CoRoT-Exo-7b, with a radius of 1.7 REarth ( ). The Kepler mission, launched in
March 2009, will observe hundreds of thousands of stars for transiting events and is
expected to ﬁnd about 1000 transiting gas giants. This mission will certainly provide
the most reliable way to get a census of Earth-sized planets around solar type stars.
It is capable of detecting several hundreds super-Earth in all orbits up to 1 year and
more than 50 Earth-sized planets (1 R⊕) in all orbits, with about a dozen in ∼1year period orbits ( ). Kepler will thus be able to discover a large number
of planets, but only a sub-sample of the most suitable ones will be followed-up with
Doppler velocimetry from the ground (HARPS-NEF and possible future instruments).
 estimate that Kepler, limited only by available observing time for HARPS-NEF,
could obtain, for dozens of super-Earths, their radius and mass with a precision of
less than 5% and 10% respectively.
Such an accuracy allows bulk estimates of the
composition for planets in the mass range 1-10 M⊕ . More details on observational
uncertainties for both CoRoT and Kepler can be found in .
Also, Kepler and CoRoT promise optical phase curves of short-period planets, while
a refurbished Hubble Space Telescope will bring new transmission spectra (from the UV
The physical properties of extrasolar planets
to near-IR) and near-IR phase curves.
Future missions like JWST and SOFIA also
promise new and exciting exoplanet atmosphere observations. As the successor of HST
and Spitzer, JWST will open new avenues in transiting exoplanet science with the
characterization of intermediate and low mass exoplanets (≤MNep). Currently, about
ten hot Jupiters have been observed with Spitzer, allowing the analysis of their emergent
spectra, and the Warm mission should double the number of detection . Spitzer
could in principle detect hot super-Earths in favorable cases, and JWST will extend
these detections to ”warm super-Earths” (∼300K). The latter mission is also capable
of measuring the day-night temperature diﬀerence of warm Earth-like planets orbiting
M-dwarfs, just as done by Spitzer for several hot Jupiters .
JWST should be
able to obtain light curves of primary and secondary eclipses of 1 R⊕terrestrial planet
around main sequence stars with a high precision, allowing basic characterisation of the
transiting exoplanet and the possibility to search for unseen planets .
From the ground, the recent discovery of the triple planetary-mass system orbiting
HR 8799 has clearly demonstrated the potential of ground-based direct imaging
campaigns. The development of a new generation of adaptive-optics (AO) systems, such
as VLT-SPHERE or the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) augurs well for direct imaging of
planets orbiting solar type stars, enabling direct detection of hundreds of warm Jovian
planets in the next decade ( ). These systems, which are precursors for the next
generation of extremely large telescopes with apertures around 30m, attempt to reach
in a near future contrasts up to 108, allowing the detection of young Jupiters of less than
100 Myr around solar type stars ( ). In the next years, AO coronographs should
thus be sensitive to a broad range of self-luminous giant planets in the ranges 1-10
MJup, 4-40 AU and 10-10 000 Myr ( ). High contrast imaging systems on Extremely
Large telescopes (ELT) should achieve contrasts allowing the characterisation of any
self-luminous planet at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral resolution. Even
mature planets in the inner part of solar systems (< 2 AU) should become detectable
through reﬂected light ( ).
Better characterization of our own solar system planets is also crucial to carry
on, with for instance the Juno mission to Jupiter which should measure atmospheric
abundances, in particular water, and accurately map its gravitational and magnetic
ﬁelds. As stressed in this review, the understanding of exoplanet physical properties
is strongly linked to the understanding of their formation process.
On this front,
our knowledge will greatly improve with the possibility to detect recently formed
giant planets either directly, through their thermal or accretion luminosity using AO
techniques as above mentioned, or indirectly by imaging the structures (e.g gaps) they
should produce in their disks with projects such as ALMA.
Finally, the possibility of identifying habitable planets, with the detection of water
vapor and signs of chemical disequilibrium in their atmospheres, is given by projects such
as DARWIN/TPF and JWST. This could be one of the most signiﬁcant and stimulating
achievements of Science, as it may tell us that we are not alone in the universe.
