In this paper, we introduce a new domain adaptation
(DA) algorithm where the source and target domains are
represented by subspaces described by eigenvectors. In this
context, our method seeks a domain adaptation solution by
learning a mapping function which aligns the source subspace with the target one. We show that the solution of the
corresponding optimization problem can be obtained in a
simple closed form, leading to an extremely fast algorithm.
We use a theoretical result to tune the unique hyperparameter corresponding to the size of the subspaces. We run our
method on various datasets and show that, despite its intrinsic simplicity, it outperforms state of the art DA methods.
1. Introduction
In classiﬁcation, it is typically assumed that the labeled
training data comes from the same distribution as that of the
test data. However, many real world applications, especially
in computer vision, challenge this assumption (see, e.g., the
study on dataset bias in ). In this context, the learner
must take special care during the learning process to infer
models that adapt well to the test data they are deployed
on. For example, images collected from a web camera are
different from those taken with a DSLR camera. A classi-
ﬁer that would be trained on the former would likely fail to
classify the latter correctly if applied without adaptation.
We refer to these different but related marginal distributions as domains. In order to build robust classiﬁers, it is
necessary to take into account the shift between these two
distributions. This issue is known as domain adaptation
(DA). DA typically aims at making use of information coming from both source and target domains during the learning
process to adapt automatically. We usually differentiate two
different scenarios: (1) the unsupervised setting where the
training data consists of labeled source data and unlabeled
target examples (see for a survey); and (2) the semisupervised case where a large number of labels is available
for the source domain and only a few labels are provided
for the target domain. In this paper, we focus on the most
difﬁcult, unsupervised scenario.
As illustrated by recent results , subspace based domain adaptation seems a promising approach to tackle unsupervised visual DA problems. In , Gopalan et al. generate intermediate representations in the form of subspaces
along the geodesic path connecting the source subspace and
the target subspace on the Grassmann manifold. Then, the
source data are projected onto these subspaces and a classi-
ﬁer is learned. In , Gong et al. propose a geodesic ﬂow
kernel which aims to model incremental changes between
the source and target domains. In both papers, a set of intermediate subspaces is used to model the shift between the
two distributions.
In this paper, we also make use of subspaces (composed
of 𝑑eigenvectors induced by a PCA), one for each domain.
However, following the theoretical recommendations of ,
we rather suggest to directly reduce the discrepancy between the two domains by moving closer the source and
target subspaces. This is achieved by optimizing a mapping
function that transforms the source subspace into the target
one. From this simple idea, we design a new DA approach
based on subspace alignment. The advantage of our method
is two-fold: (1) by adapting the bases of the subspaces, our
approach is global. This allows us to induce robust classi-
ﬁers not subject to local perturbations; and (2) by aligning
the source and target subspaces, our method is intrinsically
regularized: we do not need to tune regularization parameters in the objective as imposed by a lot of optimizationbased DA methods.
Our subspace alignment is achieved by optimizing a
mapping function which takes the form of a transformation
matrix 𝑀. We show that the optimal solution corresponds
in fact to the covariance matrix between the source and target eigenvectors. From this transformation matrix, we derive a similarity function 𝑆𝑖𝑚(yS, yT) to compare a source
data yS with a target example yT. Thanks to a consistency
theorem, we prove that 𝑆𝑖𝑚(yS, yT), which captures the
idiosyncrasies of the training data, converges uniformly to
its true value. We show that we can make use of this theoretical result to tune the hyperparameter 𝑑, that tends to
make our method parameter-free. The similarity function
𝑆𝑖𝑚(yS, yT) can be used directly in a nearest neighbour
classiﬁer. Alternatively, we can also learn a global classiﬁer
such as support vector machines (SVM) on the source data
after mapping them onto the target subspace.
As suggested by Ben-David et al. , a reduction of the
divergence between the two domains is required to adapt
In other words, the ability of a DA algorithm to
actually reduce that discrepancy is a good indication of
its performance. A usual way to estimate the divergence
consists in learning a linear classiﬁer ℎto discriminate
between source and target instances, respectively pseudolabeled with 0 and 1. In this context, the higher the error of
ℎ, the smaller the divergence. While such a strategy gives
us some insight about the ability for a global learning algorithm (e.g. SVM) to be efﬁcient on both domains, it does
not seem to be suited to deal with local classiﬁers, such as
the 𝑘-nearest neighbors. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a new empirical divergence speciﬁcally dedicated
to local classiﬁers. We show through our experimental results that our DA method allows us to drastically reduce
both empirical divergences.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We present
the related work in section 2. Section 3 is devoted to the presentation of our DA method and the consistency theorem on
the similarity measure deduced from the learned mapping
function. In section 4, a comparative study is performed on
various datasets. We conclude in section 5.
2. Related work
DA has been widely studied in the literature and is of
great importance in many areas such as natural language
processing or computer vision . In this paper, we
focus on the unsupervised domain adaptation setting that is
well suited to vision problems since it does not require any
labeling information from the target domain. This setting
makes the problem very challenging and an important issue
is to ﬁnd out a relationship between the two domains. A
common approach is to assume the existence of a domain
invariant feature space and the objective of a large range of
DA work is to approximate this space.
A classical strategy related to our work consists of learning a new domain-invariant feature representation by looking for a new projection space. PCA based DA methods
have then been naturally investigated in order to
ﬁnd a common latent space where the difference between
the marginal distributions of the two domains is minimized
with respect to the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)
divergence.
Other strategies have been explored as well
such as using metric learning approaches or canonical correlation analysis methods over different views of the
data to ﬁnd a coupled source-target subspace where one
assumes the existence of a performing linear classiﬁer on
the two domains.
In the structural correspondence learning method ,
Blitzer et al. propose to create a new feature space by identifying correspondences among features from different domains by modeling their correlations with pivot features.
Then, they concatenate source and target data using this feature representation and apply PCA to ﬁnd a relevant common projection. In , Chang transforms the source data
into an intermediate representation such that each transformed source sample can be linearly reconstructed by the
target samples. This is however a local approach that may
fail to capture the global structure information of the source
domain. Moreover it is sensitive to noise and outliers of
the source domain that have no correspondence in the target
Our method is also related to manifold alignment whose main objective is to align two datasets from
two different manifolds such that they can be projected to
a common subspace. Most of these methods need
correspondences from the manifolds and all of them exploit
the local statistical structure of the data.
Recently, subspace based DA has demonstrated good
performance in visual DA .
These methods share
the same principle: ﬁrst they compute a domain speciﬁc
d-dimensional subspace for the source data and another one
for the target data, independently created by PCA. Then,
they project source and target data into intermediate subspaces along the shortest geodesic path connecting the two
d-dimensional subspaces on the Grassmann manifold. They
actually model the distribution shift by looking for the best
intermediate subspaces. These approaches are the closest to
ours but, as mentioned in the introduction, it is more appropriate to align the two subspaces directly, instead of computing a large number of intermediate subspaces which can
potentially be a costly tuning procedure. The effectiveness
of our idea is supported by our experimental results.
As a summary, our approach has the following differences with existing methods:
We exploit the global covariance statistical structure of
the two domains during the adaptation process in contrast
to the manifold alignment methods that use local statistical
structure of the data . We project the source
data onto the source subspace and the target data onto the
target subspace in contrast to methods that project source
data to the target subspace or target data to the source subspace such as . Moreover, we do not project data to a
large number of subspaces as in . Our method is totally unsupervised and does not require any target label information like constraints on cross-domain data or
correspondences from across datasets . We do not
apply PCA on cross-domain data like in as these
approaches exploit only shared features in both domains. In
contrast, we make use of the correlated features in both domains. Some of these features can be speciﬁc to one domain
yet correlated to some other features in the other one allowing us to use both shared and domain speciﬁc features. As
far as we know, this is the ﬁrst attempt to use a subspace
alignment method in the context of domain adaptation.
3. DA using unsupervised subspace alignment
In this section, we introduce our new subspace based DA
method. We assume that we have a set 𝑆of labeled data
(resp. a set 𝑇of unlabeled data) both lying in a given 𝐷dimensional space and drawn i.i.d. according to a ﬁxed but
unknown source (resp. target) distribution 𝒟𝑆(resp. 𝒟𝑇).
We denote the transpose operation by ′.
In section 3.1, we explain how to generate the source and
target subspaces of size 𝑑. Then, we present our DA method
in section 3.2 which consists in learning a transformation
matrix 𝑀that maps the source subspace to the target one.
From 𝑀, we design a similarity function for which we derive a consistency theorem in section 3.3. This upper bound
gives us some insight about how to tune the parameter 𝑑.
3.1. Subspace generation
Even though both the source and target data lie in the
same 𝐷-dimensional space, they have been drawn according to different marginal distributions. Consequently, rather
than working on the original data themselves, we suggest
to handle more robust representations of the source and target domains and to learn the shift between these two domains. First, we transform every source and target data in
the form of a 𝐷-dimensional z-normalized vector (i.e. of
zero mean and unit standard deviation). Then, using PCA,
we select for each domain 𝑑eigenvectors corresponding to
the 𝑑largest eigenvalues. These eigenvectors are used as
bases of the source and target subspaces, respectively denoted by 𝑋𝑆and 𝑋𝑇(𝑋𝑆, 𝑋𝑇∈ℝ𝐷×𝑑). Note that 𝑋′
𝑇are orthonormal (thus, 𝑋′
𝑆𝑋𝑆= 𝐼𝑑and 𝑋′
where 𝐼𝑑is the identity matrix of size 𝑑). In the following, 𝑋𝑆and 𝑋𝑇are used to learn the shift between the two
3.2. Domain adaptation with subspace alignment
As presented in section 2, two main strategies are used in
subspace based DA methods. The ﬁrst one consists in projecting both source and target data to a common shared subspace. However, since this only exploits shared features in
both domains, it is not always optimal. The second one aims
to build a (potentially large) set of intermediate representations. Beyond the fact that such a strategy can be costly,
projecting the data to an intermediate common shared subspace may lead to information loss in both source and target
In our method, we suggest to project each source (yS)
and target (yT) data (where yS, yT ∈ℝ1×𝐷) to its respective subspace 𝑋𝑆and 𝑋𝑇by the operations yS𝑋𝑆and
yT𝑋𝑇, respectively. Then, we learn a linear transformation function that align the source subspace coordinate system to the target one. This step allows us to directly compare source and target samples in their respective subspaces
without unnecessary data projections. To achieve this task,
we use a subspace alignment approach. We align basis vectors by using a transformation matrix 𝑀from 𝑋𝑆to 𝑋𝑇.
𝑀is learned by minimizing the following Bregman matrix
divergence:
𝐹(𝑀) = ∣∣𝑋𝑆𝑀−𝑋𝑇∣∣2
𝑀∗= 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑀(𝐹(𝑀))
where ∣∣.∣∣2
𝐹is the Frobenius norm. Since 𝑋𝑆and 𝑋𝑇
are generated from the ﬁrst 𝑑eigenvectors, it turns out that
they tend to be intrinsically regularized. Therefore, we do
not add a regularization term in the equation 1. It is thus
possible to obtain a simple solution of equation 2 in closed
form. Because the Frobenius norm is invariant to orthonormal operations, we can re-write equation 1 as follows:
𝐹(𝑀) = ∣∣𝑋′
From this result, we can conclude that the optimal 𝑀∗
is obtained as 𝑀∗= 𝑋′
𝑆𝑋𝑇. This implies that the new
coordinate system is equivalent to 𝑋𝑎= 𝑋𝑆𝑋′
call 𝑋𝑎the target aligned source coordinate system. It is
worth noting that if the source and target domains are the
same, then 𝑋𝑆= 𝑋𝑇and 𝑀∗is the identity matrix.
Matrix 𝑀transforms the source subspace coordinate
system into the target subspace coordinate system by aligning the source basis vectors with the target ones. If a source
basis vector is orthogonal to all target basis vectors, it is ignored. On the other hand, a high weight is given to a source
basis vector that is well aligned with the target basis vectors.
In order to compare a source data yS with a target data
yT, one needs a similarity function 𝑆𝑖𝑚(yS, yT). Projecting yS and yT in their respective subspace 𝑋𝑆and 𝑋𝑇and
applying the optimal transformation matrix 𝑀∗, we can de-
ﬁne 𝑆𝑖𝑚(yS, yT) as follows:
𝑆𝑖𝑚(yS, yT)
(yS𝑋𝑆𝑀∗)(yT𝑋𝑇)′ = yS𝑋𝑆𝑀∗𝑋′
where 𝐴= 𝑋𝑆𝑋′

generalized dot product (even though 𝐴is not necessarily

positive semideﬁnite) where 𝐴encodes the relative contributions of the different components of the vectors in their
original space.
We use 𝑆𝑖𝑚(yS, yT) directly to perform a 𝑘-nearest
neighbor classiﬁcation task.
On the other hand, since
𝑆𝑖𝑚(yS, yT) is not PSD we can not make use of it to learn
a SVM directly. As we will see in the experimental section, an alternative solution will consist in (i) projecting the
source data via 𝑋𝑎into the target aligned source subspace
and the target data into the target subspace (using 𝑋𝑇), (ii)
learn a SVM from this 𝑑-dimensional space. The pseudocode of our algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1.

3.3. Consistency theorem on 𝑆𝑖𝑚(yS, yT)
The unique hyperparameter of our algorithm is the number 𝑑of eigenvectors. In this section, inspired by concentration inequalities on eigenvectors , we derive an upper bound on the similarity function 𝑆𝑖𝑚(yS, yT). Then,
we show that we can make use of this theoretical result to
efﬁciently tune 𝑑.
Let ˜𝐷𝑛be the covariance matrix of a sample 𝐷of size
𝑛drawn i.i.d. from a given distribution and ˜𝐷its expected
value over that distribution.
Theorem 1. We start by using a theorem from . Let
𝐵be s.t. for any vector x, ∥x∥≤𝐵, let 𝑋𝑑
the orthogonal projectors of the subspaces spanned by the
ﬁrst d eigenvectors of ˜𝐷and ˜𝐷𝑛. Let 𝜆1 > 𝜆2 > ... >
𝜆𝑑> 𝜆𝑑+1 ≥0 be the ﬁrst 𝑑+ 1 eigenvalues of ˜𝐷, then for
with probability
at least 1 −𝛿we have:
√𝑛(𝜆𝑑−𝜆𝑑+1)
From the previous theorem, we can derive the following
lemma for the deviation between 𝑋𝑑
For the sake of simpliﬁcation, we will use in the following
the same notation 𝐷(resp. 𝐷𝑛) for deﬁning either the sample 𝐷(resp. 𝐷𝑛) or its covariance matrix ˜𝐷(resp. ˜𝐷𝑛).
Lemma 1. Let 𝐵s.t. for any x, ∥x∥≤𝐵, let 𝑋𝑑
the orthogonal projectors of the subspaces spanned by the
ﬁrst d eigenvectors of 𝐷and 𝐷𝑛. Let 𝜆1 > 𝜆2 > ... >
𝜆𝑑> 𝜆𝑑+1 ≥0 be the ﬁrst 𝑑+ 1 eigenvalues of 𝐷, then for
with probability
at least 1 −𝛿we have:
The last inequality is obtained by the fact that the eigenvectors are normalized and thus ∥𝑋𝐷∥≤
𝑑and application
of Theorem 1 twice.
We now give a theorem for the projector of our DA

𝑆𝑛(resp. 𝑋𝑑

where 𝑀𝑛is the solution of the optimization problem of
Eq 2 using source and target samples of sizes 𝑛𝑆and 𝑛𝑇
respectively, and 𝑀is its expected value.
The ﬁrst equality is obtained by replacing 𝑀and
𝑀𝑛by their corresponding optimal solutions 𝑋𝑑
′ from Eq 3. The last inequality is obtained by
applying twice Lemma 1 and bounding the projection operators.
From Theorem 2, we can deduce a bound on the deviation between two successive eigenvalues. We can make use
of this bound as a cutting rule for automatically determining the size of the subspaces. Let 𝑛𝑚𝑖𝑛= min(𝑛𝑆, 𝑛𝑇) and
𝑑+1) = min((𝜆𝑇

can select the maximum dimension 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥such that:

long as we select a subspace dimension d such that 𝑑≤
𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥, the solution 𝑀∗is stable and not over-ﬁtting.
3.4. Divergence between source and target domains
The pioneer work of Ben-David et al. provides a generalization bound on the target error which depends on the
source error and a measure of divergence, called the 𝐻Δ𝐻
divergence, between the source and target distributions 𝒟𝑆
𝜖𝑇(ℎ) = 𝜖𝑆(ℎ) + 𝑑𝐻Δ𝐻(𝒟𝑆, 𝒟𝑇) + 𝜆,
where ℎis a learned hypothesis, 𝜖𝑇(ℎ) the generalization
target error, 𝜖𝑆(ℎ) the generalization source error, and 𝜆the
error of the ideal joint hypothesis on 𝑆and 𝑇, which is supposed to be a negligible term if the adaptation is possible.
Eq. 6 tells us that to adapt well, one has to learn a hypothesis which works well on 𝑆while reducing the divergence
between 𝒟𝑆and 𝒟𝑇. To estimate 𝑑𝐻Δ𝐻(𝒟𝑆, 𝒟𝑇), a usual
way consists in learning a linear classiﬁer ℎto discriminate
between source and target instances, respectively pseudolabeled with 0 and 1. In this context, the higher the error of
ℎ, the smaller the divergence. While such a strategy gives
us some insight about the ability for a global learning algorithm (e.g. SVM) to be efﬁcient on both domains, it does
not seem to be suited to deal with local classiﬁers, such as
the 𝑘-nearest neighbors. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a new empirical divergence speciﬁcally dedicated
to local classiﬁers. Based on the recommendations of ,
we propose a discrepancy measure to estimate the local density of a target point w.r.t. a given source point. This discrepancy, called Target density around source TDAS counts
how many target points can be found on average within a 𝜖
neighborhood of a source point. More formally:
∣{yT∣𝑆𝑖𝑚(yS, yT) ≥𝜖}∣.
Note that TDAS is associated with similarity measure
𝑆𝑖𝑚(yS, yT) = yS𝐴yT′ where 𝐴is the learned metric.
As we will see in the next section, TDAS can be used to
evaluate the effectiveness of a DA method under the covariate shift assumption and probabilistic Lipschitzness assumption .
The larger the TDAS, the better the DA
4. Experiments
We evaluate our method in the context of object recognition using a standard dataset and protocol for evaluating
visual domain adaptation methods as in . In
addition, we also evaluate our method using various other
image classiﬁcation datasets.
4.1. DA datasets and data preparation
We provide three series of experiments on different
datasets. In the ﬁrst series, we use the Ofﬁce dataset 
and Caltech10 dataset that contain four domains altogether to evaluate all DA methods. The Ofﬁce dataset consists of images from web-cam (denoted by W), DSLR images (denoted by D) and Amazon images (denoted by A).
The Caltech10 images are denoted by C. We follow the
same setup as in . We use each source of images as a
domain, consequently we get four domains (A, C, D and
W) leading to 12 DA problems. We denote a DA problem
by the notation 𝑆→𝑇. We use the image representations
provided by for Ofﬁce and Caltech10 datasets (SURF
features encoded with a visual dictionary of 800 words). We
follow the standard protocol of for generating
the source and target samples1.
In a second series, we evaluate the effectiveness of our
DA method using other datasets, namely ImageNet (I), LabelMe (L) and Caltech-256 (C). In this setting we consider
each dataset as a domain. We select ﬁve common objects
(bird, car, chair, dog and person) for all three datasets leading to a total of 7719 images. We extract dense SIFT features and create a bag-of-words dictionary of 256 words using kmeans. Afterwards, we use LLC encoding and a spatial
pyramid (2 × 2 quadrants + 3 × 1 horizontal + 1 full image)
to obtain a 2048 dimensional image representation (similar
data preparation as in ).
In the last series, we evaluate the effectiveness of our DA
method using larger datasets, namely PASCAL-VOC-2007
and ImageNet. We select all the classes of PASCAL-VOC-
2007. The objective here is to classify PASCAL-VOC-2007
test images using classiﬁers that are built from the ImageNet
dataset. To prepare the data, we extract dense SIFT features
and create a bag-of-words dictionary of 256 using only ImageNet images. Afterwards, we use LLC encoding and spatial pyramids (2×2 + 3×1 + 1) to obtain a 2048 dimensional
image representation.
4.2. Experimental setup
We compare our subspace DA approach with two other
DA methods and three baselines. Each of these methods
deﬁnes a new representation space and our goal is to compare the performance of a 1-Nearest-Neighbor (NN) classi-
ﬁer and a SVM classiﬁer on DA problems in the subspace
We consider the DA methods Geodesic Flow Kernel
(GFK ) and Geodesic Flow Sampling (GFS ). They
have indeed demonstrated state of the art performances
achieving better results than metric learning methods 
and better than those reported by Chang’s method in .
Moreover, these methods are the closest to our approach.
We also report results obtained by the following three baselines: Baseline 1: where we use the projection deﬁned
by the PCA subspace 𝑋𝑆built from the source domain to
project both source and target data and work in the resulting representation. Baseline 2: where we use similarly the
projection deﬁned by the PCA subspace 𝑋𝑇built from the
target domain. No adaptation NA: where no projection is
made, we use the original input space without learning a
new representation.
For each method, we compare the performance of a 1-
Nearest-Neighbor (NN) classiﬁer and of a SVM classiﬁer
1See supplementary material section 1.1 for the experimental details
and additional results.
(with C parameter set to the mean similarity value obtained from the training set) in the subspace deﬁned by
each method. For each source-target DA problem in the
ﬁrst two series of experiments, we evaluate the accuracy
of each method on the target domain over 20 random trials. For each trial, we consider an unsupervised DA setting
where we randomly sample labeled data in the source domain as training data and unlabeled data in the target domain as testing examples. In the last series involving the
PASCAL-VOC dataset, we rather evaluate the approaches
by measuring the mean average precision over target data
using SVM.
We have also compared the behavior of the approaches
in a semi-supervised scenario by adding 3 labelled target
examples to the training set for Ofﬁce+Caltech10 series and
50 for the PASCAL-VOC series. This can be found in the
supplementary material.
4.3. Selecting the optimal dimensionality
In this section, we present our procedure for selecting the
space dimensionality d in the context of our method. The
same dimensionality is used for Baseline1 and Baseline2.
For GFK and GFS we follow the published procedures to
obtain optimal results as presented in . First, we perform a PCA on the two domains and compute the deviation
𝑑+1 for all possible 𝑑values. Then, using the theoretical bound of Eq: 5, we can estimate a 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥<< 𝐷that
provides a stable solution with ﬁxed deviation 𝛾> 0 for a
given conﬁdence 𝛿> 0. Afterwards, we consider the subspaces of dimensionality from 𝑑= 1 to 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥and select the
best 𝑑∗that minimizes the classiﬁcation error using a 2 fold
cross-validation over the labelled source data. This procedure is founded by the theoretical result of Ben-David et al.
of Eq 6 where the idea is to try to move the domain distribution closer while maintaining a good accuracy on the
source domain. As an illustration, the best dimensions for
the Ofﬁce dataset vary between 10 −50. For example, for
the DA problem W →C, taking 𝛾= 105 and 𝛿= 0.1, we
obtain 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥= 22 (see Figure 2) and by cross validation we
found that the optimal dimension is 𝑑∗= 20.
4.4. Evaluating DA with divergence measures
Here, we propose to evaluate the capability of our
method to move the domain distributions closer according
to the measures presented in Section 3.4: the TDAS adapted
to NN classiﬁcation where a high value indicates a better
distribution closeness and the 𝐻Δ𝐻using a SVM where a
value close to 50 indicates close distributions. We compute
these discrepancy measures for the 12 DA problems coming
from the Ofﬁce and Caltech datasets and report the mean
values over the 12 problems for each method in Table 1.
We can remark that our approach reduces signiﬁcantly the
discrepancy between the source and target domains com-

pared to the other baselines (highest TDAS value and lowest 𝐻Δ𝐻measure). Both GFK and our method have lower
𝐻Δ𝐻values meaning that these methods are more likely
to perform well2.
4.5. Classiﬁcation Results
Visual domain adaptation performance with Of-
ﬁce/Caltech10 datasets: In this experiment we evaluate the
different methods using Ofﬁce /Caltech10 datasets
which consist of four domains (A, C, D and W). The results for the 12 DA problems in the unsupervised setting
using a NN classiﬁer are shown in Table 2. In 9 out of the
12 DA problems our method outperforms the other ones.
The results obtained in the semi-supervised DA setting (see
supplementary material) conﬁrm this behavior. Here our
method outperforms the others in 10 DA problems.
The results obtained with a SVM classiﬁer in the unsupervised DA case are shown in Table 3. Our method outperforms all the other methods in 11 DA problems. These
results indicate that our method works better than other DA
methods not only for NN-like local classiﬁers but also with
more global SVM classiﬁers.
Domain adaptation on ImageNet,
LabelMe and
Caltech-256 datasets : Results obtained for unsupervised
DA using NN classiﬁers are shown in Table 4. First, we can
remark that all the other DA methods achieve poor accuracy when LabelMe images are used as the source domain,
while our method seems to adapt the source to the target
reasonably well. On average, our method signiﬁcantly outperforms all other DA methods.

same class, even though the appearance of images are very
different from the two datasets.
In Table 5 we report results using a SVM classiﬁer for
the unsupervised DA setting. In this case our method outperforms all other DA methods, conﬁrming the good behavior of our approach.

DA settings. We use ImageNet as the source domain and
PASCAL-VOC-2007 as the target domain. The results are
shown in Figure 3 for the unsupervised case and in the sup-

plementary material for the semi-supervised one.
Our method achieves the best results for all the categories in both settings and outperforms all the methods on
average. The semi-supervised DA seems to improve unsupervised DA by 10% (relative) in mAP. In the unsupervised
DA setting, GFK improves by 7% in mAP over no adaptation while our method improves by 27% in mAP over GFK.
In the semi-supervised setting our method improves by 13%
in mAP over GFK and by 46% over no adaptation.
5. Conclusion
We present a new visual domain adaptation method using subspace alignment.
In this method, we create subspaces for both source and target domains and learn a linear
mapping that aligns the source subspace with the target subspace. This allows us to compare the source domain data
directly with the target domain data and to build classiﬁers
on source data and apply them on the target domain. We
demonstrate excellent performance on several image classi-
ﬁcation datasets such as Ofﬁce dataset, Caltech, ImageNet,
LabelMe and Pascal-VOC. We show that our method outperforms state of the art domain adaptation methods using
both SVM and nearest neighbour classiﬁers. We experimentally show that our method can be used on tasks such
as labelling PASCAL-VOC images using ImageNet dataset
for training. Due to its simplicity and theoretically founded
stability, we believe that our method has the potential to be
applied on large datasets consisting of millions of images.
As future work we plan to extend our domain adaptation
method to large scale image retrieval and on the ﬂy learning
of classiﬁers.
