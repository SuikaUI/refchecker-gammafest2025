THE REGULARITY OF MAPPINGS WITH A CONVEX POTENTIAL
LUIS A. CAFFARELLI
In this work, we apply the techniques developed in [Cl] to the problem of
mappings with a convex potential between domains.
That is, given two bounded domains Q" Q2 of Rn and two nonnegative
real functions 1; defined in 0i that are bounded away from zero and infinity,
we want to study the map v = V'll for a Lipschitz convex'll, such that V'll
maps a, onto Q2 in the a.e. sense and in some (weak) sense.
In recent work Y. Brenier showed existence and uniqueness of such a map
(provided that laOil = 0) under the obvious compatibility condition
The map V'll is into O2 in the sense that 'II = sup La with La linear functions
and V La E O2 , The Monge-Ampere equation (1) is satisfied in the weak sense.
( q(Y)J;,(Y) dy = (
q(V'II)~ (X) dX
for any continuous function q, (here V'll is understood in the Loo-sense).
As can be seen by an elementary example, this definition is strictly weaker
than the classical definition of weak solution by Pogorelov, since it is unable to
see the singular part of detDij'll .
On the other hand, if both Q i are convex, Pogorelov [P] constructed a weak
solution in the Alexandrov sense.
The purpose of this note is to show
Theorem. If O2 is convex and 1;, 1/1; are bounded, then Brenier's solution is
a weak solution in the sense of Alexandrov.
Further, 'II is strictly convex and C' ,p for some p.
If 1; are continuous, 'II E ~~P for every p.
If 1; are Ca , 'IIEC2 ,a for any O<a<a.
Further regularity follows from classical standard estimates.
The main difficulty in the proof of the theorem consists in showing that
Brenier's solution is indeed a solution in the sense of Alexandrov, i.e., that

detDjjlfl has no singular part and that IfI is strictly convex (in the sense of
After this, the results in [CI, C2, C3] provide the complete regularity theory.
To see that the condition needed on 02 is of geometrical nature, and neither
a topological or differentiability one, consider the following examples.
(i) Let, on R2 ,
lfIo = Ix,1 + 2(x, + x2)·
Then Vlflo = (x, + sign x, ,x2) is the (unique) map from the unit disc onto the
two shifted halfdiscs, Dt + (1, 0) and D; - (1,0). In the Alexandrov sense,
though, detDijlfl has a singular measure along {x, = O} and the image VIfI,
as a multivalued map, fills the strip Ix,1 ::; 1 .
(ii) Bridge now the two shifted halfdiscs of the previous example with an ehorizontal strip {IX21 < e, Ix,,::; I} , make an e-smoothing of the new domain
to make it COO with total area
10 2 1 = n = ID,I,
and consider the Brenier map Vlfle: D, -
0e (with f == 1). It follows from
Brenier's theorem that lfIe converges uniformly to lfIo' and hence in the sense
of Alexandrov that
lim I detDijlfle(D,)1 ~ I detDijlflo(D,)1
(I I denotes total mass).
But since IdetDijlflo(D,)1 = ID,I + 1{lx" < I}I (the added strip due to the
singular part of detDijlflo) ' it follows that detDijlfle must also have a singular
part for e small enough.
The difficulty posed by this counterexample is easily solved by the following
Lemma 1. If IfI is locally Lipschitz and convex then
(a) a point of Lebesgue differentiability of V IfI (as an L 00 function) is a point
of continuity for V IfI ;
(b) if V 1fI, in the a.e. sense, is contained in 0, then, in the multivalued map
sense, VIfI is contained in reO), the closed convex envelope of O.
Proof. (a) If 0 is not a point of continuity for VIfI we have at zero at least
two supporting planes that can be normalized to be Z = ±ax, (a > 0) by
subtracting an appropriate linear function.
Let r; be the cone
r; = {X: (X, e,) ~ (I-e)IXI}.
Along this cone a supporting plane at a point Xo = (xo, l), (xo a scalar),
Z = (6, X) +a
must satisfy
Z(O) = a < 0 and Z(Xo) = v,xo + (62 , l) +a ~ axo.

In particular,

~ax or VI ~a-o v2 ,yo .
In particular, since along r, III < Cexo and 11121 ::; C because", is Lipschitz,
VI + Ce ~ a.
For e small enough, VI ~ a12. Conversely in the opposite cone, r; , VI ::;
-a12 and 0 is not a point of Lebesgue differentiability.
This proves part (a).
In order to prove part (b), since values of Lebesque differentiability of V",
are, after (a), mapped in 0, we need to prove the following:
Let 0 be a point of discontinuity for V", and 1: the convex, (nontrivial) set
of supporting planes to '" at O.
We will say that i1 is a strongly extremal point of 1: if 1: is tangent from
inside to some sphere at i1.
For bounded convex sets, strongly extremal points are dense in the set of extremal points, and therefore, it is enough to show that strongly extremal points,
i1, are limits of points of continuity for V", .
By subtracting a linear function and a rotation we may assume that i1 = 0
and 1: c BR(Rel) (the ball of radius R and center Rei .)
We then show that along any cuspidal domain around the ray -Ael , all
possible supporting vectors converge to zero.
Indeed, any sequence v(k) must converge to a point in 1:, and hence their
first component satisfy
limv~k) ~ O.
On the other, i1 = 0 being a supporting plane, '" ~ 0 and from the argument
in part (a).
lim(V"" -el } ~ -Ce
along any re cone around the -el axis.
Hence lim v~ = 0 and vk must converge to zero along any cuspidal domain.
We now study solutions '" when 02 is already convex.
More precisely
Lemma 2. Consider a convex function rp such that
(a) rp = supL" , L" linear, VL" E °2 ;

(c) for any continuous "
CI j"evrp)(X)dX::; r ,,(Y)dY::; C2 r "eVrp(X))dX
(Vrp as an L oo function).
Then, in the sense of Alexandrov rp satisfies (in all of Rn)
CIXn ::; detDi,orp ::; C2Xn .
L. A. CAFFARELLI
Proof. It is clear that
CIXn, ~ detDijrp·
Indeed, for any compact set KI c n l ' K2 = "Vrp(KI) in the multivalued sense
is compact. If Y/ is any continuous majorant of XK
! y/(Y)dx ~ CI! Y/C'Vrp)dX ~ CIIKII.
In particular if "V rp(S) for S C n l has measure zero, also S must have
measure zero.
To prove the second part of the inequality, we recall that given K compact
in the X space, the set D, in the "V space of those u such that
('Vrp)-I(U) n K '10 and ("Vrp)-I(U) n ~
has measure zero. (See [el], the proof of the remark in p. 137.)
Hence 1("Vrp)-I("Vrp(KI))\KII = o.
But now for any KI and any continuous majorant Y/ of "Vrp(KI ) , we have
l"Vrp(KI)1 ~ r
y/(Y) dY = r Y/(Y) dY ~ C2 r y/("Vrp) dX.
If now 0 ~ Y/ ~ I and Y/ converges uniformly to zero on compact sets outside "Vrp(KI) , y/("Vrp) converges uniformly to zero on compact subsets of n l \
("Vrp)-I("Vrp(KI)) .
Therefore J y/("Vrp(X)) dX is controlled by IXvtp-'(Vtp(K) = IXK,I and the
proof is complete.
At this point we have been able to show that detDijrp has no singular measure.
To complete our argument; let us show that rpln is strictly convex (in the
sense of [el], i.e., that every tangent plane has only one contact point with
graph of rp) .
We first point out that if rp is a globally Lipschitz convex nonnegative function and rp == 0 on a line (say in the e I direction) then rp e == 0 and hence
det Dijrp == O.
Therefore it is enough to prove.
Lemma 3. Let rp be a globally Lipschitz convex nonnegative function, that satisfies, in the Alexandrov sense
CIXn ~ detDijrp ~ C2Xn .
Then, if the (convex) set S = {rp == O} intersects n l in more than a point, then
S has no extremal points (and contains therefore a line).
Proof. rp being convex and globally Lipschitz, it has an asymptotic cone at
infinity and "V rp (Rn) is a bounded convex set with non empty interior r.
We recall from [el] that S cannot have extremal points in n l , and since
detDijrp == 0 on ~nl' it follows that S can only have extremal points on
MAPPINGS WITH A CONVEX POTENTIAL
As it was observed before Lemma 3, S cannot contain a line (if not detDijqJ
== 0). Hence it must have a supporting plane, let us say x, = 0, that has only
one contact point, say 0, with S.
Then 0 must belong to ao, ' and since S has also a point in the interior of
0, ' we have the following geometric situation:
(i) S c {x, :::; O}, Sn{x, = OJ = 0, and hence Sn{x, ;::: -M} is compact
for any M.
(ii) 0 also belongs to ao, and hence 0, C BR for some Ro.
(iii) S has a point Xo in (the interior of) 0,.
In particular some ball BJ(Xo) cO, . As in [Cll we will study the renormalization of the functions qJe = -e(x, + 2Ro) + qJ on the set {qJe < O} = Se·
That is, Se has nonempty interior since 0 and Xo E Se and, therefore,
by an affine transformation we may obtain sets S; and graphs qJ; such that
B, c S; c Bn.
C,Xo* :::; detDij,qJ; :::; C2Xo*
qJ* == 0 on aD; .
Since Se converges uniformly to S n {x, > -2Ro} , a compact set, Se is
uniformly bounded for e small and therefore the affine transformation Te that
sends Se in S; is an expansion, i.e., II Te(X) - Te(Y)1I ;::: qx - YI , independentlyof e.
In particular 0; = Te(O) ::) Te(BJ(XO)) ::) Be J(X;).
As in [Cll we now will get a contradiction by showing that both qJ; stays
close to its infimum near as; , and cannot do so.
On one hand, from Alexandrov estimate,
IqJ;(X)11i :::; dist(X, as:) Total mass (detDijqJ;) :::; Cd(X, as:)
since detDijqJ* is bounded.
On the other hand, consider S;,J/2 = {X E S;ld(X, as;) ;::: Co6/2}.
There, lV'qJl :::; fl infs' qJl. But
Volume{V'qJ(S:,J/2)} = 1.
detDijqJ dX ;::: C6n .
Hence suPs'
lV'qJl;::: C6 and
Finally, we look at Te(O).
I inf qJ: I ;::: C 62 .
On one side Te(O) converges to as; when e goes to zero since the opposite
supporting planes of Se' {x, = -Ae}{x, = Be}' remain uniformly separate
(since they enclose Xo and 0) and Be tends to zero since Se converges to S.

On the other, the ratio
converges to one since
I inf qJel :::; sup e(xi + 2Ro),
qJe(O) = - 2eRo
and sUPxl ES, Xl goes to zero when Se converges to S.
The proof of the theorem is now complete. 0
