1. Introduction
Let f be a probability density on an interval I, finite or infinite: I includes its
finite endpoints, if any; and f vanishes outside of I. Let X1, ...,X k be inde-
pendent random variables, with common density f The empirical histogram
for the X's is often used to estimate f To define this object, choose a reference
point xosI and a cell width h. Let Nj be the number of X's falling in the jth
class interval:
[Xo +j h, xo +(j + l) h).
On this interval the height of the histogram H(x) is defined as
This definition forces the area under H to be 1. The dependence of H on k and
h is suppressed in the notation.
On the average, how close does H come to f? A standard measure of
discrepancy is the mean square difference:
~2 = E {f [fI(x)- f (x)3 2 dx}.
This quantity is analyzed on the following assumptions:
(1.2) feL z and f is absolutely continuous on I, with a.e. derivate f'
(1.3) f'~L z and f' is absolutely continuous on I, with a.e. derivative f"
(1.4) f"eLp for some p with l<p<2.

Conditions (1.3) and (1.4) have the (non-obvious) consequence that f' is
continuous and vanishes at oo. In particular, f' is bounded; see (2.21) below.
Also, f' is in fact the ordinary (everywhere) derivative of f Likewise, f is
continuous and vanishes at oe. It will also be assumed that
I is the union of class intervals.
For instance, if I= and Xo=0 , condition (1.5) requires that h=l/N for
some positive integer N. By present conditions, if I = , then f and f' are
continuous on I, even at 0 and 1.
(1.6) Theorem. Assume (1.1-1.5). Let
7 = ~f'(x) 2 dx > 0
~=61/3 7-1/3.
Then, the cell width h which minimizes the 82 of (1.1) is ~ k-1/3+ O(k-a/2), and at
such h's, 82=ilk -2/3 q--O(k-1).
The technique deVeloped to prove (1.6) can be used to give a result under
weaker conditions.
(1.7) Theorem. Suppose f~L 2 is absolutely continuous with a.e. derivative f'~L 2
and ~f'(x)Z dx>O. Suppose (1.5) as well. Define ~ and fl as in (1.6). Then the cell
width which minimizes the 8 2 of (1.1) is o~k-1/3q-o(k -1/3) and at such h's, 8 2
~-fl k-2/3 +0(k--2/3).
Such results suggest that the discrepancy 62 can be made small by choosing
the cell width h as ock -1/3. Of course, this depends on 7, which will be
unknown in general cases. In principle, y can be estimated from the data, as in
Woodroofe . However, numerical computations, which will be reported
elsewher e , suggest that the following simple, robust rule for choosing the cell
width h often gives quite reasonable results.
Rule: Choose the cell width as twice the interquartile range of the data,
divided by the cube root of the sample size.
Rough versions of (1.6) and (!.7) seem part of the folklore. Two recent
references providing formal computations are Tapia and Thompson , and
Scott .
We hope to study the random variable A2= ~ [H(x)-f(x)]2dx in a future
paper. The standard deviation of A 2 is of smaller order than E(A2)=8 2. Thus,
choosing h to minimize 82 is a sensible way to get a small A 2. To be a bit
more precise, the standard deviation of A2 is of order k-lh-1/z~k -5/6 for the
optimal h~k -1/3. Using (1.6), the minimal discrepancy A 2 is of order k -2/3
give or take a nearly normal random variable of the smaller order k -5/6.
The histogram may be considered a very old-fashioned way of estimating
densities. However, histograms are easy to draw; and, unlike kernel estimators,
On the Histogram as a Density Estimator: L 2 Theory
are very widely used in applied work. Mathematical aspects of density esti-
mation are surveyed by Rosenblatt , Cover , Wegman ,
Tarter and Kronmal , Fryer , Wertz and Schneider , and
references listed therein. These papers report a great deal of careful work on
discrepancy at a point, and on global results for kernel estimates and other
"generalized" histograms. The results show that the mean square error of
kernel estimates tends to zero like a constant times k -4Is, while (1.6) implies
that the mean square error of histograms tends to zero like a constant times
k -2/3. Asymptotically, this rate is worse, a fact which seems to have stopped
further work on the mathematics of histograms. However, for finite sample
sizes, the constants determine everything. For example, take k=500: then
k -~*i5 -0.007 while k -2/3 -0.016. The asymptotic rate of k -4Is can be achieved
using another old-fashioned object: the frequency polygon. This is provable
with the techniques of this paper.
Before describing our results more carefully, it is helpful to separate the
discrepancy (1.1) into sampling error and bias components. To this end, let
1 Xo+(n+l)h
~+, f(u)du
for Xo+nh<x<Xo+(n+l)h.
Proposition. Suppose feL2, and (1.5). Then
1 !fh(x)2dx+ (. [fh(x)--f(x)]Zdx.
E {5 [H(x)-f(x)] 2 dx} - k h
Proof. Suppose xo+nhNx<Xo+(n+l)h.
Then H(x)=N,/kh, and N, is bi-
nomial with number of trials k and success probability P,h----hfh(X)" In partic-
{H(x)} :L(x),
Var {H(x)} = L fh(X) [1 -- hA(x)]
Now integrate in x over I.
The term 5 (fh--f) 2 in (1.10) represents the bias in using discrete intervals of
width h. Reducing h diminishes this bias, at the expense of increasing the
sampling error term 1/k h, for the number of observations per cell will decrease
as h gets smaller. The tension between these two is resolved by (1.6) and (1.7).
Section2 of this paper is about the bias term ~(fh--f)2; Sect. 3 gives exam-
ples to show what happens when the regularity conditions like (1.3) and (1.4)
are relaxed. In particular, (1.7) fails for some beta and chi-squared densities.
Section 4 gives the proof of (1.6) and (1.7). Clearly, the uniform density requires
special treatment, since the optimal number of class intervals is one. This
density is excluded by the condition that 5f'2>0, which surfaces in Lemma
(4.5) of Sect. 4.
D. Freedman and P. Diaconis
2. The Bias Term
To begin with assume only that
f is an L z function on the interval I.
Define fh by (1.9). Let J be a union of class intervals. Clearly,
y fh(x) dx = y f (x) dx
5 fh(x) 2 dx < If(x) z dx
the fh are square integrable uniformly in h.
Also, fh converges tof in L2:
~ (fh-f):-+O
For the proof of (2.5), approximate f in L 2 by a continuous function with
compact support. Estimates on the rate of convergence in (2.5) will be helpful.
For this, additional assumptions are needed. One such is:
f is an L z function on the interval I, and f is absolutely continuous
with a.e. derivative f', and f'sL z.
Under (2.6), the bias term on the left of (2.5) tends to zero like h 2. More
precisely;
Proposition. Suppose (2.6) and (1.5). Let
r(h)= ! [fh(x ) --f (x)] 2 dx _1 h2 ! f,(x) 2 dx.
Then r(h)= o(h2).
Proof To ease the notation, write g for f', and set x0=0. Focus on a specific
class interval, for instance, [0, hi. Clearly,
f (x) = a + i g(u) du
where a=f(0). In computing S(fh--f) z, the constant a will cancel, so it is
harmless to set a = 0. Of course,
~(fh--f)2-----Sf2--hfk z.

In what follows, u v v=max(u, v) and u A v =min(u, v). Because a =0,
5f 2= 5 5 5 g(u) g(v) dudvdx
=~ ~ ~ g(u)g(v)dxdudv
= ~ ~ (h-u v v) g(u) g(v) dudv.
fh=~ ! (h - u) g(u) du
h fh =-~ i o ! (h-u) (h- v) g(u) g(v) dudv

G(u, v) = (h - u v v) - ~(h - u) (h - v)
=(u+v)-(uv~)-~uv
~-U A I)--~UIJ.
This defines ~b h as a function from O<=u, v<h. Note that 4~(u,O)=O(u,h)
= ~b(0, v)= q~(h, v)= 0. Define q5 on the whole plane by periodic continuation.
The argument thus far shows that
1 (n+l)h (n+l)h
It will now be shown that ~n~Snh(g)'-+ 0 as h--* 0.
If g is constant on [nh, (n+ 1)h], a direct computation shows that ~Snh(g)=0.
But g may be approximated closely in L 2 by a function go which is constant
on each class interval: for instance, apply (2.5) to g. It remains to show that
G a.~(g) - z. a.;,(g o)
D. Freedman and P. Diaconis
is uniformly small as h---, 0. Of course,
I(.I g~)~- (j go) ~1 < IIg- go II
is small, so it remains only to show that Z,A,h is small, where
1 (n+l)h (n+l)h
S d?h(U,v)[g(u)g(v)-go(U)go(v)]dudv"
Now Iq~hl<h, and
Ig(u) g(v) -go(U) go(V)l < Ig(u)-go(U) l " [ g(v)[ + Ig(v)- go(V)l" Igo(U)[
so h IA,hl < ~,h +/~,h, where
[~ Ig(v)-go(v)ldv"
~ Ig(v)-go(v)ldv.
~ Igo(v)ldv.
Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,

Notes. (i) If f'r 2, then ~(fh--f) 2 need not be of order h2: see example (3.1).
(ii) If (2.6) holds and f'=~0, then (fa-f)/h converges weakly in L 2 to 0,
not strongly (in L 2 norm).
Indeed, the proposition
shows that
I[(fh-f)/h[12--,1/12[[f'[I2>O;
this rules out strong convergence to 0. To
argue weak convergence to 0, let ~sL 2. Write 1{ } for the function which is 1
if the statement in braces is true, and 0 otherwise, and now let
qSh(U , V)=(1 -h-lu)-i{u<v}.

As before, (2.8) vanishes if 0 is constant on [0, hi, and Iq~h[ < 1, SO 0 can be
replaced by a function constant over the class intervals, without disturbing
1/h ~ (fh -f) ~ very much.
For later use, it will be helpful to improve the o(h 2) error term in (2.7) to
o(ha), To accomplish this, an additional regularity condition like (1.4) is need-
ed. Indeed, example (3.11) below constructs a nonnegative f~L 1 c~L 2, such that
f'~L 2 and f"~Lo~; but r(h) is only of order h 2
As a preliminary,
(2.9) Let O(u)=lOu(1-u) (1-2u) for 0_u_<l, and be continued periodically
over the line.
The function O(u) is a constant multiple of the third Bernoulli polynomial: see
Sect. 1.2., 11.2 of Knuth .
Lemma. O(u) vanishes at O, 89 and 1. It is positive on (,~) and anti-
symmetric about 89 so ~ O(u) du =0. Furthermore, [0[ < 1.
Lemma. Let @~L 1. Then SO(u/h) O(u)du~O as h~O.
Proof. This is a variation on the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma. To prove it
replace ~ by a nearby function in L 1 constant on each class interval.
The form of the next theorem may seem curious, but it gives sharp es-
timates for S(fh-f)2.
Theorem. Suppose (1.5) and (2.6). Suppose f' is locally of bounded
variation, determining the signed measure ]2. Let ]2 + and ]2- be the positive and
negative parts of ]2, I]2] = ]2++ ]2-, and
dnh = I]21 {IX o q- nh, x o + (n + 1) h]}.
D h = z~ndnh < 00.
Then f~Ll(]2 ). Define r(h) as in (2.7). Then
h3 ! O[(x- Xo)/h]f'(x ) ]2(dx) < 3 h3D h.
Proof. Without loss of generality, set Xo=0. The first step is to show that
f'~Lt(]2 ). First, it will be shown that for any ~[0, h],
~ If'[ Id]21 ~ If'(~)l doh + do 2.

In (2.14) and below, Jd#l indicates integration with I~1. To verify (2.14), split the
interval of integration at 4. Now

Likewise, for the integral from ~ to h. Finally,
Isxl fro, @2 + I~1 {(~, hi} 2 ~ Isxl {[0, hi} 2.
This completes the proof of (2.14).
Now for any ~,e[nh> (n+ 1) hi,
If'l Idsxl < lf'(~.)l d.h +d. 2.
Sum, and use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
SIf'l Idvl < [DhS.f'(~.)2] 1/2 + Dh
with suitably chosen ~,. This completes the proof that f'eLl(lx ).
Write Oh(u)=O(ulh ). Since O h is bounded, Ohf'eLl(#) as well. Turn now to
the main inequality. Clearly, it is enough to prove that

Since 101 < 1,

Corollary. Suppose (1.2-1.5). Define r(h) as in (2.7). Then r(h)=o(h3).
Proof. Assume without loss of generality that Xo=0. The idea is to use (2.12).
To estimate Dh, choose q so that -+-=1,
where p appears in (1.4) and
1 _<_p=<2, so 2X-<q< oo. Now use Holder's inequality:
1 [(n+ 1)h
1.lf"(x)[dx<hV
~h If''fp ~"
{f"L p ~_~h2 2
-~ fl(h) ~ If"[ p
~.h If"lP) p "
If p=2, then fl(h)=l for all h, and Dh=O(h)=o(1 ). If p=l, then h2-2/p=l for
all h, and fl(h)~O as h--+0, so Dh=o(1 ). Likewise, if l<p<2,
=o(h2-2/p)=o(1). As (2.12) shows, f'f"eL 1 and
Ir(h)l ~6~0 h3 [~(h)l-{-~-h 3 D h
e(h) = ~ O(x/h) f'(x) f"(x) dx,
Now e(h)~0 as h--+0, by (2.11).
Notes. (i) With the assumptions and notation of (2.20), not only is f' c,,el
but f'~Lq. This is so by assumption for p=2. If p<2, then q>2, and
]f,lq_= ff,lq- 2 If,j2.
But f' is bounded by (2.21) below.
(ii) If f is smooth, then ~Ohf'f" is of order h, as is Dh, so r(h) is of or-
(iii) However, example (3.3) below constructs an f with f"eC[O, 1], yet
fO~f'f" is only of order 1/log . Now D h is of order h, so r(h) is of order

appear in Sect. 2 and 3 of Chap. 5 of Beckenbach and Bellman .

so the ratio of the two integrals is arbitrarily close to 1.
Corollary. Suppose 0 is L 1 and absolutely continuous on (-oo, oo). Let
a, be a monotone bilateral sequence of real numbers, with a, ~ -ov as n---, -co
and a, ~ + co as n ~ + oo. Choose 4, arbitrarily in [a,, a,+ 1] and let

Proof The left hand side is at most

Remarks. The arguments for (2.22) and (2.24) work, in exactly the same way,
when ~b is only assumed to be locally of bounded variation, determining the
signed measure ~ with variation [#1. The integrals on the right hand side of the
inequalities are replaced by I#[ [a, b] and [#l(-o% or) respectively. This in-
cludes (2.22) and (2.24) since ]P[ [a, b]=~ Iq~'l. It is easy to construct examples
where the Riemann sum is not a good approximation to a smooth L 1
function. Take triangles of height 1, centered at the positive integers, the j-th
triangle having base 1/j 2. Smooth the triangles, and define the function to be
zero elsewhere. This function has positive, finite integral, but the Riemann sum
approximation can be zero or infinite depending on the choice of a, and 4,. Of
course, the right hand side of the bound is infinite. For related material, see
the discussion of direct Riemann integrability in Sect. 11.1 of Feller .
3. Examples
(3.1) Example. Suppose f is L 2 on , and is absolutely continuous, but
f'(~L 2. Then S (fh-f) 2 need not be of order h 2, Consider the beta distribution:
f(x)=x ~, so
f(x)=ex ~-1
f'(x)=c~(c~-l)x ~-2.
0.5 < ~ < 1.5. Then ~ (fh-f)2 is of order h 2~- 1.
On the Histogram as a Density Estimator: L 2 Theory
Proof. Let h= 1IN. On [nh, (n+ 1)hi,

~ q =q< oe. Also, %>O by (3.2), so q>O, and

n ~=0 qn ) h2~- l - q ha~- l +
Note. If e=l.5, then 2c~-1=2, but the argument breaks down because
L',n 2~-4 diverges. Then ~(fh--f) 2 is of order h 2 log h. When e= 1, the argument
applies, but q = 0 because each qn = 0. When c~ = 1/2, the density f is not in L 2 .
Example. Suppose f satisfies (1.2-1.4) on I=E0,1l and f"=g
tinuous on E0, 1]. Still

r(h) = ! (fh --f)
can be of order h3/log~, rather than of order h 4, along a sequence of h's
tending to 0. See the notes following Corollary (2.20).
The construction uses notation defined in (2.9-2.13). A preliminary lemma
is needed.
Lemma. Let 0 be defined by (2.9). Let qJ be absolutely continuous on E0, 1]
with a.e. derivative O'. Let m and n be nonnegative integers. There are finite,
positive constants A and B, which do not depend on •, m, or n, such that:
i O(nu)~k(u)du< 1 A i lO'(u)t du
~ O(mu) O(nu) O(u) du <m A n B ~ [Iq4u)l + 14"(u)13 du.
D. Freedman and P. Diaconis
Proof Claim (a). Let O(u)- O(v)dv. The periodicity of 0 implies that 0>0.
Likewise, 0 has period 1 and vanishes at all the integers. Let A=max O.
Integrate by parts:
O(nu) O(u) clu =
~ O(nu) O'lul du.
Claim (b). Suppose m<n. Apply claim (a) to the function O(mu) tp(u). []
Construction. Let h)= 1/2 j2 and define
O(u/hj)/j 2
Clearly, g is continuous (but not much more). Let
if(x) = b + ~ g(u) du
and f(x) =~f'(u) du.
Choose b so f'>0 on .
Now r(h) can be estimated using Theorem (2.12). In the notation of that
theorem, the measure # is absolutely continuous with density g. Clearly,
dnh <-h. max Igl, so
9 (max Igl) = O(h).
What is left is to estimate h 3 ~O(x/h)f'(x)f"(x)dx.
Recall that f"(u) = g(u) = S, O(u/hk) k 2, so
i O(u/h)f'(u)f"(u)du=kF~,o = ~!O(u/h~)O(u/hs)f'(u)du

It will now be shown that the two sums on the right in (35) are negligible.
Of course, O(u/hk)=O(2k~u). Use (3.4b) on the first sum, with f' for 0: when
O(u/hk) O(u/h ~) f'(u) du < 2k~- J~B t
where B is from (3.4b) and

Similarly, use (3.4b) on the second sum, with f' for 0: when k>j,
O(u/hk) O(u/hi) f'(u ) du < 2 j~ -k~ B1"
The second sum is at most
~---~ 2J2-k~ < B3/2 2j
where B~=89 1, ~ 1/k 2, becausej2-kZ<j2-(]+ l)2 = -2j-1.
Condition (1.4) constrains f" to lie in Lp for some p with l<p<2. This
guarantees that r(h)= o(h 3) by (2.20). Other values of p will not do, as the next
sequence of examples shows. The densities are made up of an infinite sequence
of quadratic "bumps". The conditions for (2.20) demand feL~. In the exam-
ples, usually f(~Lz.

Now define a "bump" of height parameter b, width parameter ~, and
starting point a. This hmction f on [a, a+4e] is characterized by the require-

Lemma. Let f be a bump of height parameter b, width parameter e, and
starting point a. Then
(i) f'(a+4e)=
(ii) maxf'=be
and minf'=-be,
(iii) f(a+4e)=
(iv) maxf=be 2 and

S f 2=Bb2es,
~ f= Cbe 3.
Here, A, B,
positive, finite constants, whose
exact value is
immaterial.
Now make a "bump function" f on [0, oo) as follows. Choose a sequence
of height parameters b~, width parameters ei, and multiplicities nj. The function
f will have bumps starting at 0, 1, 2, .... The first n~ bumps all have height
parameters b 1 and width parameters e 1. The next n 2 bumps all have height
parameters b 2 and width parameters e2; and so on. Here b~>0, e~=l/4 7j for
some positive integer 7, and nj is a positive integer. The remainder
is to be estimated for h=ej and Xo=0. Let n=n t + ... +nj. Now
r(h) = r 1 (h) + r2(h ) + r3(h ).
rl(h)=~(fn_f)z
will be called the "early bump error". It depends only on the first n bumps.
r2(h ) = _
h 2 f (f,)2
is the "incomplete-f' error", and depends only on bumps n+l, n+2,....
r3(h) = ; (fh _f)2
is the "incomplete-f error", and it too depends only on bumps n + 1, n + 2, ....
On the Histogram as a Density Estimator: L 2 Theory
We have required e j+ ~ to divide ej evenly. As a result, the early bump error
is easily estimated from (3.6). Indeed, fix h=e: and consider the bump on J
=[a,a+4e~] where i<j. Let M=e]ej=4 ~~
There are M class intervals
which evenly cover [a,a+e~]; another M which cover [a+e~,a+28i]; etc. On
each such class interval the bump is quadratic. This proves:
The early-bump error is

The incomplete-f' error is

Also, r(h) can be estimated using (3.8-9-10). The early-bump error is of order
ey/j4, as is the incomplete-f error. The incomplete-f' error is dominant, being
of order ~y/j3

Typically, d is not an integer.

4. The Optimization
Theorems (1.6) and (1.7) are proved in this section. The following notation will
be used throughout: Let
0k(h) = E {j [H(x) -f(x)] 2 dx},
qbk(h)= ~-f~+ bh 2 ,
d = ~f(x) 2 dx.
On the Histogram as a Density Estimator: L 2 Theory
Both theorems give an approximation to the cell width h* which minimizes
the expected L 2 error 0k(h), and the size of this error at h*. The argument will
show that 0k(h) is a continuous function of h on (0, oo), tending to oo as h
tends to 0, and tending to some positive limit as h tends to infinity. The latter
limit is bounded away from 0, as k tends to oo. Further, inf0k(h) is of order
k -z/3--'0. As a result, inf0~(h) is attained, say at h*. To begin, it is useful to
introduce an approximation to 0k(h); this is q~k(h) defined in (4.1b). The first
lemma shows that ~bk(h ) achieves its minimum at ~k -1/3 and at this minimum
is of size fik -2/3. These are the lead terms of (1.6) and (1.7). All preliminary
lemmas are proved under the assumptions of (1.7).
Lemma. q~k(') is minimized at hk=(2bk)-l/3 =c~k -1/3, and
~bk(hk) = 3.2- 2/3. b~/3 . k- 2/3 = ilk- 2/3.
G(h)>G(hk)+b(h-hk) 2,
d~k(h)<(~k(hk)+3b(h--hk) 2 if
4k(h)<~k(hk)+ 3b(h-hk)2 +lh-hkl3/kh 4 ifh<hk.
Proof. Claim (a). Consider the difference between the left side and the right.
The derivative turns out to be positive to the right of h~, and negative to the
left. Clearly, the difference is 0 at hk, completing the argument.
Claim (b). By Taylor's theorem,
~bk(h ) = 4k(hk) + (h - hk) qSk(hk) + 89 -
qb k (hk) + ~(h - hk) 3 ~b(k3)(~),
with h k < ~ <h. Of course, 4'k(hk)= 0, and q~'(hk)= 6b, and qS(k3)(h)=- 6/kh 4 <0.
Claim (c). This is like (b).
Note. The bounds in (4.6a-b) are a bit surprising because the coefficient b does
not depend on k. At hk, of course, qb~ 3) is of order -k ~/3, so the function q5 k is
changing shape as k grows.
Lemma. (a)
Ok(h) is a continuous function of h for 0 < h < oo.
lim 0k(h)= oo.
Proof Claim (a). The (fh--f) and fh are uniformly square integrable by (2.4);
as h,--,h, clearly fh,--'fh a.e. So fhn--*fh in L 2. Now use (1.10).
Claim (b). Use (1.10).
The next job is to estimate inf0k(h ) carefully, and show that unless h is
rather close to the h k of (4.2), 0k(h) is too large to be the inf. It is convenient to
estimate Ok(h) separately in three zones: 0 < h < 6, and 6 _< h_< L, and L < h < Go.
Only the first zone will matter.

Lemma. For any 6>0 and L>3 there are positive numbers OoL and k~L
such that k>k~L implies rain {~k(h):6<_h<_L} > O.
Proof In view of (1.10) and (2.3)
The first term on the right is a continuous function of h, as in (4.4). It cannot
vanish: if it did, f=--fh; either f is discontinuous, or f'---0; both possibilities
are ruled out by hypothesis. At this point we use the condition Sf'2>0 to
exclude the possibility that f is, e.g., uniform over , in which case h = 1 is
optimal. Let 0 o be the minimum over h with 5<_h<_L of
S(fh--f) 2.
l!f2<89 o.
So 0 0 > 0. For k large,
(4.6) Lemma. For any 6>0 there are positive numbers 0~ and k~ such that
~k(h)>=Ot for all h>=3 and k>k~.
Proof As h~ o% it is clear that fh--*O pointwise. The convergence is L 2 by
uniform integrability (2.4). So I(fh--f)2---~f 2. Choose L so large that h>L
entails ~ fh-- )

The argument for (1.7) is easier than the argument for (1.6), and will be
presented first.
Proof of Theorem (1.7). Fix e with 0<e<b: (see 4.1c). Use (2.7) to choose 6>0
so small that [r(h)[ =<eh 2 for 0<h<5. Now use (1.10) and (2.3):
(ak(h)--eh2--~<_<_Ok(h)<Ok(h)+eh
In particular, the infinimum of ~k(h) over h with 0 < h__< 6 is smaller than
rain [~bk(h ) + eh 2] = 3.2 - 213. (b + 0 1/3. k- zla
and larger than
kd ~_ [min (~k(h )_ eha] = _~ + 3.2-2/a.( -2/3.
Here, (4.2) has been used with b++_e in place of b; and k is so large that
[2(b-e)k]-113<6.
Because e was arbitrary, the infimum of Ok(h) over h
with 0<h___b is
3.2- 2/3. b 1/3. k- 2/3 + o(k- 2/3).
Now (4.4-6) show that ~k(') has a global minimum, say at h~, any such h*
tends to 0 as k~ o% and Ok(h*)=qSk(hk)+O(k-21a).
On the Histogram as a Density Estimator: L 2 Theory
To bound the location of h~, apply (4.3) with b-e in place of b, and use
(4.7) again. For O<h<5,
@k(h)> fi~k- ~ -~+(b-e)(h-hk) 2,
/~ = 3.2- 2/3. (b - ~)1/3.
If [h-hkl>~lk -1/3, and a is small, and k is large, then
Ok(h) > fi~k- 2/3 _ k + (b - e) t/2 k- 2/3 > min @k.
In particular, any h* must be within rlk -1/3 of h k, for k large.
Theorem (1.7) asserts a bit more than has been proved so far: that for any
h suitably
close to h k, 0k(h) is close to its minimum.
Ih-hkl<tl k-1/~, where t? is small. To finish the proof, 0k(h) will be estimated
above and below. First, if r/<89 (2b) -1/3, then
89 <h<2h k.
Now @k(h) can be estimated from below using (4.7) and (4.2):
Ok(h) >= Ok(h)-- gh 2 -~
>4)k(hk)--a4h~
Since e is arbitrary, and h k is of order k- 1/3,
Ok(h) > d~k(hk) + o(k- 2/3).
The estimate for Ok(h) from above is very similar when h>hk; see (4.3b). So,
89 <__hk-t]k-1/3 <h<_hk.
Now use (4.7) and (4.3c):
Ok(h) < 4)k(hk) + ah 2 + 3 b tl 2 k- 2/3 + T
T= Ih - hk[ 3/kh 4 < (rl k- ~/3)3 /k(89 hk) 4
<2 4 . t/3 . (2 b)4/3 . k-2/3.
Again, a is arbitrary and h k is of order k -1/3. Also t/ is arbitrary; so if Ih--hkl
=o(/<1/3),
as desired.

Note. We guess that h~ is unique, but cannot prove this without additional
conditions.
Turn now to the proof of Theorem (1.6). Assume (1.1-1.5). This is stronger
than the assumptions for (1,7), so for any 6 > 0, the infimum over all h of Ok(" )
is achieved in 0 < h < 6 and tends to 0 as k tends to oo. The region 0 < h < 6 will
be split into the following zones, defined in terms of h k from (4.2) and a
constant A to be chosen later:
9 th-hkl<=A/kl/2
Ih-hkJ>A/k 1/2
For any small positive constant c there is a 60 such that for 0<h<6 o
Ok(h) --~-- ch 3 <= Ok(h) < Ok(h) + ch 3.
This follows from (1.10): relation (2.3) shows Sfh2<Sf 2 and the bias term is
estimated by (2.20).
Lemma. Choose c and 6 o as in (4.9). Let k be so large that 2hk<6Oo Fix
A finite and positive. If 89
and [h-hk] <=A/k 1/2, then
Ok(h)>(G(hk)-(4.b+d).- s
Ok(h)<Ok(hk)+(3b2A+4b).~+(16b)4/3A3
Proof Claim (a). Since h 3 <8h2 =4/b, relation (4.9) implies
0k(h) > qSk(h ) - (4. g + d
and Ok(h)>Ok(hk) by (4.3).
Claim (b). First, suppose h>h k. By (4.9) and (4.3b),
Ok(h) < d?k(h ) + 4.b.k
Second, suppose h <h k. Then an extra term T must be added to the upper
T= Ih - h~13/kh ~ < A 3/EkS/2(hJ2) ~3
<(16b)'~/3A3/kT/6.

Proof minOk(h)<Ok(hk)<Ok(hk)+ch2 by (4.9).
If h is more than A/k 112 away from hk, then 0k(') is larger than the upper

Lemma. Choose A so large that

If h<2hk, but Ih-hkl> A/k 1/2, then

These bounds force the following conclusions: for large k the h's minimiz-
ing 0k(') are to be found in the interval hk+_A/kl/2; on that whole interval
Ok(h) = C~k(hk)+ O(1/k). This completes the proof of Theorem (1.6).
