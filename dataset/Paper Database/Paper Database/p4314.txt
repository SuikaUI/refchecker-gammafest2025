About 300 carcinogens and non-carcinogens
of a wide variety of chemical types have been tested for mutagenicity in the simple Salnonella/microsome test. The test
uses bacteria as sensitive indicators for DNA damage, and
mammalian liver extracts for metabolic conversion of carcinogens to their active mutagenic forms. Quantitative mutagenicity data from linear dose-response curves are presented:
potency varies over a 106 -fold range. There is a high correlation between carcinogenicity and mutagenicity: 90% (156/
174) of carcinogens are mutagenic in the test and despite the
severe limitations inherent in defining non-carcinogenicity,
few "non-carcinogens" show any degree of mutagenicity.
The results also demonstrate the great utility, and define the
limitations, of the test in detecting environmental carcinogens.
There is considerable evidence that a large proportion of
human cancer may be caused by exposure to toxic chemicals
in the environment, very few of which have been tested for
carcinogenicity or mutagenicity. A program of cancer prevention aimed at identifying and eliminating human exposure to hazardous chemicals requires the development of
rapid, inexpensive, screening methods as complements to expensive,
long-term animal
to pinpoint dangerous
chemicals among the thousands to which humans are exposed. The Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test (1-4)
has been sufficiently developed and validated to be seriously
considered for widespread use in this way. The considerable
evidence (5), much of it obtained using this test (1-4, 6-13),
that with few exceptions carcinogens are mutagens, supports
the desirability of using this type of rapid and economical
test system as a screening technique (1-3).
Chemicals are tested for mutagenicity on petri plates with
several specially constructed mutants of Salmonella typhimurium (2-4). Homogenates of rat (or human) liver, (S-9
Mix), are added directly to the petri plates, thus incorporating an important aspect of mammalian metabolism into the
in vitro test (2). In this way, a wide variety of carcinogens
requiring metabolic activation can be detected easily as mutagens (2, 4, 5). The system has been recently reviewed (6)
and the test method described in detail (7).
The present paper presents mutagenicity data on a large
number of carcinogens and non-carcinogens of many different classes that have been examined in the system using a
standard methodology (7) to determine the correlation between mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, and the utility of
the test, at this stage of its development, for the detection of
various types of carcinogens.
DISCUSSION AND RESULTS
Results are in Table 1. For each chemical, quantitative data
are presented as revertants per plate (histidine revertants on
* This is part I of a series.
a petri plate/number of micrograms tested). For mutagenic
compounds, data are from the linear region of dose-response
curves, and for non-mutagenic chemicals, data are presented
as less-than figures at the highest dose-level tested. The
number of revertants per nmol is an indication of the mutagenic potency of the chemical in the test system.
All non-mutagens, and most mutagens, have been tested,
using the recently improved standard methodology (7), on
the new R factor tester strains (4) as well as the earlier standard tester strains (3). Non-mutagens have been tested over
a wide dose range both with and without the liver microsome activating system.
In addition to our previously published studies and new
work presented here, results have been contributed to this
compilation by a number of laboratories using this test, including a large contribution from Japan. Some of the chemicals tested are also specified in a contract sponsored by the
National Cancer Institute (V. Simmon and H. Rosenkranz,
to be published). Some of the non-carcinogens we tested
were specified in a contract sponsored by the Environmental
Protection Agency to B. Commoner.
We have not reported on any metal carcinogens, though
three or four that have been tested are negative in the standard test. The test system is not suitable for metals entering
the bacteria because of the large amount of Mg salts, citrate,
and phosphate in the minimal medium. A number of carcinogenic metals have been shown to be mutagens in bacteria
by means of a different methodology, e.g. ref. 14.
In addition to the compounds presented we have tested 46
common biochemicals that are non-carcinogens, or presumed non-carcinogens, and have found that all were negative in the test (<0.01 revertants/nmol). These data will be
presented in a companion paper that will appear in this journal. The companion paper will also discuss the results presented here, the utility and limitations of the test in detecting chemicals likely to be environmental mutagens and carcinogens for humans, quantitation of mutagenic potency,
and somatic mutation as the most attractive hypothesis to explain chemical carcinogenesis.

Car. Carcinogenicity. Classification, especially non-carcinogenicity, is usually difficult because of the varying completeness and modes of
treatment in many studies and the statistical limitations inherent in animal tests. + = carcinogen; 0 = non-carcinogen; w+ = weak carcinogen (occasionally used for comparison to potent relative; in general, we have not evaluated carcinogenic potency, an inherently complex area);
?+ or ?0 = carcinogen, or non-carcinogen, in limited studies, further confirmatory work required; cO = non-carcinogen in most studies, with
some reports of weak or marginal activity; ? = inadequate data available for classification as a carcinogen or non-carcinogen. T = under test
[chemicals B5 and B7, personal communication B. McKusick (du Pont)l; 7r = promoter.
Mut. Mutagenicity. The standard Salmonella plate test (7) was used except where indicated. + = mutagenic; 0 = non-mutagenic; w+ =
weakly mutagenic (<0.10 revertants/nmol); ? = chemical toxicity prevented adequate mutagenicity test. Data is presented when a complete
dose-response curve (almost always linear; * in Revertants per nmol column = non-linear) was obtained. In cases where a spot (7) or well test
(61) was used, or a complete dose-response curve was not available, and the mutagenicity was clear, the compound is reported mutagenic but
quantitative data are not given. t in Revertants column = liquid test (7, 21, 44), a modification where the bacteria are preincubated with the
S-9 Mix before pouring plates: chemicals K10, L5, L9, Lll, not tested in standard plate test; chemicals L6, Lb0, K9, GI (47), G2 (47) negative
in standard plate test; chemicals G3, G4, G5 less active in liquid test (21, 47); chemical L6, NADH and ATP added to S-9 Mix. = =
analyzed for impurities by high pressure liquid chromatography: weak activity of chemical A7 all due to 0.25% A3 impurity; of chemical A22
not all due to trace of A21; of chemical A28 not all due to trace of A26; of chemical A20 not due to several impurities; chemical AlO, insufficient material available for chromatography (if 0.1% A3 impurity present,
it could account for very weak activity: see chemical A7); of
chemical Al I not due to several impurities; chemical A12 data given is for purified material [direct mutagenic activity previously reported (3)
due to impurities] (V. Donahue, J. McCann, and B. N. Ames, in preparation).
Revertants per plate. Numbers given are revertant colonies on a petri plate per micrograms of chemical incorporated in the plate, e.g.,
1630/10 = 1630 revertant colonies per 10 jig tested. For mutagenic compounds the numbers are single points from linear dose-response curves.
Spontaneous revertant colonies have been subtracted: usually 20 (tester strain TA1535), 7 (TA1537), 25 (TA1538), 140 (TA100), or 40 (TA98).
For non-mutagenic compounds, a less-than figure is used to indicate the result: the denominator is the maximum dose tested-each non-mutagenic compound was tested over a wide dose range, usually 10, 100, and 500 or 1000 ,g (often higher for TA100) for non-toxic compounds, and
up to the maximum allowable concentration if the compound was inhibitory; the numerator is 1/2 the spontaneous reversion rate of the strain
for which results are reported (usually <70, for TA100). Each non-mutagenic compound was tested both with and without S-9 (usually Aroclorinduced microsomes were used) on at least strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98, and TA100. A compound was called non-mutagenic (0) if there was
no dose-response. G = the chemical is a gas or very volatile liquid, the test was done in a dessicator, and quantitation is difficult.
Revertants per nmol. We have calculated the number of revertants per nmol from the revertants per plate and the molecular weight. The
value represents the mutagenic potency of the particular chemical in reverting the strain indicated in the standard assay. The Salmonella/
microsome test is a back mutation test using tester strains containing different types of mutations. The relationship of the mutagenic potency
of a mutagen on a particular strain to the overall mutagenic potential of the compound for DNA in general, and to carcinogenic potency, remains to be determined. In addition the standard assay represents a compromise between various factors such as amount of S-9, induction
procedure, etc. Thus, comparisons between potency of different chemicals must be undertaken with caution. This important and complex
subject will be discussed further. * = non-linear dose-response. t = liquid test (see Mut.).
Strain. The standard tester strains (3, 4, 7) are abbreviated by a single digit as follows: O(TA100), 5(TA1535), 7(TA1537), and 9(TA98);
8(TA1538) contains the same histidine mutation as TA98, which has replaced it as a more sensitive indicator for some mutagens; 3(TA1530)
and 4(hisG46) are old tester strains and are the same as TA1535 except they lack the uvrB or deep rough mutations (3). The first digit of the
series means that the data come from the test with that strain: each other digit, in the case of a mutagen, means that the chemical is also
mutagenic on that strain or, in the case of a non-mutagen, that it has been tested on that strain. Chemicals have been designated non-mutagenic only if they have been tested on at least strains 0, 9, 5, and 7, the complete set of strains recommended for general mutagenesis testing
S-9. The S-9 fraction (9000 x g supernatant of rat liver) was added (A or P or +) or not (-) as indicated. Liver was from rats induced with
Aroclor 1254 (A) (12, 7) or phenobarbital (P) (2, 7). (+) = S-9 added, induction procedure not A or P, or unspecified (see individual reference).
P- or A- indicates that the data were from an experiment with S-9, but that the compound was somewhat active without S-9.
Ref. References are given for carcinogenicity/mutagenicity data, respectively. We have mainly cited three compendia for carcinogenicity
(15-17), which contain the primary source references, rather than citing the large number of primary sources for carcinogenicity or non-carcinogenicity. Where individual papers have been cited no attempt has been made to determine priority. For mutagenicity the first reference in
the series refers to the source of the data quoted (X = this study) and others to previous reports, or independent observations. All non-mutagens reported here have been tested both with and without S-9 on the new tester strains TA100 and TA98 and over a wide dose-range on all
strains: as a general rule we have not cited negative mutagenicity studies unless they fulfill these criteria. We have also not cited mutagenicity
studies in other organisms, some of which predate results in the Salmonella test. Personal communication citations are as follows: a = T.
