Original Image
Areas of the image,
where it is possible to
detect a head, legs, and
arms are identified.
Respective component
detectors operate on
these areas only.
The "most suitable" head,
legs, and arms are
identified by the
component detectors.
The component scores,
i.e. raw output of the
component classifiers,
are fed into the
combination classifier.
The combination
classifier classifies the
pattern as a "person" or
"non-person".
A person is detected.
The solid rectangle
outlines the person. The
dashed boxes mark the
components of the
Combination Classifier:
Support Vector Machine
Component Detectors are
applied to all locations of
permissible areas.
