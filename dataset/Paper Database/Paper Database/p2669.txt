We study the social structure of Facebook “friendship” networks at one hundred
American colleges and universities at a single point in time, and we examine the
roles of user attributes—gender, class year, major, high school, and residence—at
these institutions. We investigate the inﬂuence of common attributes at the dyad
level in terms of assortativity coeﬃcients and regression models. We then examine larger-scale groupings by detecting communities algorithmically and comparing
them to network partitions based on the user characteristics. We thereby compare
the relative importances of diﬀerent characteristics at diﬀerent institutions, ﬁnding
for example that common high school is more important to the social organization
of large institutions and that the importance of common major varies signiﬁcantly
between institutions. Our calculations illustrate how microscopic and macroscopic
perspectives give complementary insights on the social organization at universities
and suggest future studies to investigate such phenomena further.

1. Introduction
Since their introduction, social networking sites (SNSs) such as Friendster, MySpace, Facebook, Orkut, LinkedIn, and myriad others have attracted hundreds of
millions of users, many of whom have integrated SNSs into their daily lives to communicate with friends, send e-mails, solicit opinions or votes, organize events, spread
ideas, ﬁnd jobs, and more [Boyd and Ellison, 2007]. Facebook, an SNS launched
in February 2004, now overwhelms numerous aspects of everyday life, and it has
become an immensely popular societal obsession [Boyd, 2007b, Boyd and Ellison,
2007, Lewis et al., 2008b, Mayer and Puller, 2008]. Facebook members can create
self-descriptive proﬁles that include links to the proﬁles of their “friends,” who may
or may not be oﬄine friends. Facebook requires that anybody who one wants to
add as a friend conﬁrm the relationship, so Facebook friendships deﬁne a network
(graph) of reciprocated ties (undirected edges) that connect individual users.
The emergence of SNSs such as Facebook and MySpace has revolutionized the
availability of social and demographic data, which has in turn had a signiﬁcant impact
on the study of social networks [Boyd and Ellison, 2007, Krebs, 2008, Lievrouw and Livingstone,
2005]. It is possible to acquire very large data sets from SNSs, though of course the
population online and actively using SNSs is a biased sample of the broader population. Services like Facebook also contain large quantities of demographic data,
as many users now voluntarily reveal voluminous amounts of detailed personal information. An especially exciting aspect of studying SNSs is that they provide an
opportunity to examine social organization at unprecedented levels of size and detail,
and they also provide new venues to test sampling eﬀects [Kurant et al., 2011]. One
can investigate the structure of an SNS like Facebook to examine it as a network in
its own right, and ideally one can also try to take one step further and infer interesting insights regarding the oﬄine social networks that an SNS imperfectly parallels.
Most people tend to draw their Facebook friends from their real-life social networks
[Boyd and Ellison, 2007], so it is not entirely unreasonable to use Facebook networks
as a proxy for an oﬄine social network. (Of course, as noted by Hogan , one
does need to be aware of signiﬁcant limitations when taking such a leap of faith.)
Social scientists, information scientists, and physical scientists have all jumped
on the SNS data bandwagon [Rosenbloom, 2007]. It would be impossible to exhaustively cite all of the research in this area, so we only highlight a few results; additional
references can be found in the review by Boyd and Ellison . Boyd [2007a] also
wrote a popular essay about her empirical study of Facebook and MySpace, concluding that Facebook tends to appeal to a more elite and educated cross section
than MySpace. The company RapLeaf [Sodera, 2008] has compiled global demographics on the age and gender usage of numerous SNSs. Other recent studies have
investigated the manifestation on SNSs of race and ethnicity [Gajjala, 2007], religion
[Nyland and Near, 2007], gender [Geidner et al., 2007, Hjorth and Kim, 2005], and
national identity [Fragoso, 2006]. Preliminary research has also suggested that online
friendship networks can be exploited to improve shopper recommendation systems
on websites such as Amazon [Zheng et al., 2007].
Several papers have attempted to increase understanding of how SNS friendships
form. For example, Kumar et al. examined preferential attachment models of
SNS growth, concluding that it is important to consider diﬀerent classes of users.
Lampe et al. explored the relationship between proﬁle elements and number
of Facebook friends, and other scholars have examined the importance of geography [Liben-Nowell et al., 2005] and online message activity [Golder et al., 2007] to
online friendship formation. Other papers have established strong correlations between network participation and website activity, including the motivation of people
to join particular groups [Backstrom et al., 2006], the recommendations of online
groups [Spertus et al., 2005], online messages and friendship formation [Golder et al.,
2007], interaction activity versus sense of belonging [Chin and Chignell, 2007], and
the role of explicit ideological relationship designations in aﬀecting voting behavior
[Brzozowski et al., 2008, Hogg et al., 2008]. Lewis et al. [2008b] used Facebook data
for an entire class of freshmen at an unnamed, private American university to conduct a quantitative study of social networks and cultural preferences. The same data
set was also used to examine user privacy settings on Facebook [Lewis et al., 2008a].
In the present paper, we study the complete Facebook networks of 100 American
college and universities from a single-day snapshot in September 2005. This paper
is a sequel to our previous research on 5 of these institutions [Traud et al., 2010],
in which we developed some of the methodology that we employ here. In September 2005, one needed a .edu e-mail address to become a member of Facebook, and
the majority of “friendship” ties were within the same institution. We thus ignore
links between nodes at diﬀerent institutions and study the Facebook networks of
the 100 institutions as 100 separate networks. For each network, we have categorical data encompassing the gender, major, class year, high school, and residence
(e.g., dormitory, House, fraternity, etc.) of the users. We examine homophily and
community structure (network partitions that are obtained algorithmically) for each
of the networks and compare the community structure to partitions based on the
given categorical data. We thereby compare and contrast the organizations of the
100 diﬀerent Facebook networks, which arguably allows us to compare and contrast
the organizations of the underlying university social networks that they imperfectly
represent. In addition to the inherent interest of these Facebook networks, our investigation is important for subsequent use of these networks—which were formed
via ostensibly the same generative mechanism online—as benchmark examples for
numerous types of computations, such as new community detection methods.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst discuss the Facebook data and present the methods that we used for testing homophily at the dyad
level and demographic prevalences at the community level. We then present and
discuss results on the largest connected components of the networks, student-only
subnetworks, and single-gender subnetworks. Finally, we summarize and discuss our
The data that we use was sent directly to us in anonymized form by Adam
D’Angelo of Facebook. It consists of the complete set of users (nodes) from the
Facebook networks at each of 100 American institutions (which we enumerate in
Table A.1) and all of the “friendship” links between those users’ pages as they existed
in September 2005. The data clearly identiﬁes most institutions, although there are a
small number of disambiguation problems. For instance, 4 diﬀerent “UC” institutions
plus “Cal” are in the data, and there are 2 “Texas” listings. Each institution in the
data includes a number appearing as part of its name that appears to correspond to
the order in which each institution “joined” Facebook. The data can be downloaded
at 
Similar snapshots of Facebook data from 10 Texas institutions were analyzed recently by Mayer and Puller , and a snapshot from “a diverse private college
in the Northeast U.S.” was studied by Lewis et al. [2008b]. Other studies of Facebook have typically obtained data either through surveys [Boyd and Ellison, 2007]
or through various forms of automated sampling [Gjoka et al., 2010], thereby missing nodes and links that can impact the resulting graph structures and analyses.
We consider only ties between people at the same institution, yielding 100 separate
realizations of university social networks and allowing us to compare the structures
at diﬀerent institutions.
We consider four networks for each of the 100 Facebook data sets: the largest
connected component of the full network (which we hereafter identify as “Full”), the
largest connected component of the student-only network (“Student”), the largest
connected component of the female-only network (“Female”), and the largest connected component of the male-only network (“Male”). The Male and Female networks are each subsets of the Full network rather than the Student network. Each
network has a single type of unweighted, undirected connection between nodes and
can thus be represented as an adjacency matrix A with elements Aij = Aji indicating
the presence (Aij = 1) or absence (Aij = 0) of a tie between nodes i and j. The
resulting tangle of nodes and links, which we illustrate for the Reed College student
Facebook network in Figure 1, can obfuscate any organizational structure that might
be present.
The data also includes limited demographic (categorical) information that is volunteered by users on their individual pages: gender, class year, and (using anonymous
numerical identiﬁers) high school, major, and residence. We use a “Missing” label
for situations in which individuals did not volunteer a particular characteristic. The
diﬀerent characteristics allow us to make comparisons between institutions, under
the assumption (see the discussion by Boyd and Ellison ) that the communities and other elements of structural organization in Facebook networks reﬂect (even
if imperfectly) the social communities and organization of the oﬄine networks on
which they’re based. It is an important research issue to determine just how imperfect this might be [Hogan, 2009], but this is far beyond the scope of the present paper
(though we hope that others will take on this particular challenge). The conclusions
that we draw in this paper apply directly to the university Facebook networks from
September 2005, and we expect that they can provide insight about the real-world
social networks at the institutions as well.
3. Methods
We study each network at both the dyad level and the community level. We ﬁrst
consider homophily [McPherson et al., 2001, Newman, 2010, Wasserman and Faust,
1994]) quantiﬁed by assortativity coeﬃcients using the available categorical data.
For some of the smaller networks, we additionally perform independent logistic regression on node pairs to obtain the log odds contributions to edge presence between
two nodes that have the same categorical-data value. We similarly ﬁt exponential
random graph models (ERGMs) [Frank and Strauss, 1986, Handcock et al., 2008,
Lubbers and Snijders, 2007, Robins et al., 2007, Wasserman and Pattison, 1996] with
triangle terms to these smaller networks. Finally, we partition the networks by algorithmically detecting communities [Fortunato, 2010, Porter et al., 2009], which
we compare to the given categorical data using the technique in this paper’s prequel [Traud et al., 2010]. Calculating assortativity values and log odds contributions
allows us to examine “microscopic” features of the networks, while comparing algorithmic partitions of the networks to the categorical data allows us to examine their
“macroscopic” features.
As we illustrate below, both perspectives are important
because they provide complementary insights.
3.1. Assortativity
A general measure of scalar assortativity r relative to a categorical variable is
given by Newman :
r = tr(e) −∥e2∥
∈[−1, 1] ,
where e = E/∥E∥is the normalized mixing matrix, the elements Eij indicate the
number of edges in the network that connect a node of type i (e.g., a person with
a given major) to a node of type j, and the entry-wise matrix 1-norm ∥E∥is equal
to the sum of all entries of E. By construction, this formula yields r = 0 when the
amount of assortative mixing is the same as that expected independently at random
(i.e., eij is simply the product of the fraction of nodes of type i and the fraction of
nodes of type j), and it yields r = 1 when the mixing is perfectly assortative.
3.2. Logistic Regression and Exponential Random Graphs
We further measure the inﬂuence of the available user characteristics on the likelihood of a “friendship” tie via a ﬁt by logistic regression (under an assumption of
independent dyads) and by an ERGM speciﬁcation that includes triangle terms. Our
focus is on trying to calculate the propensity for two nodes with the same categorical
value to form a tie. We consider each of the four categorical variables (major, residence, year, and high school) and use the ERGM package in R [Handcock et al., 2008]
for both models (treating each network as undirected). We used R 2.11.1 and the
statnet package version 2.1-1, and we note that diﬀerent versions of R and statnet
caused diﬀerent degrees of convergence with the structural elements in the model.
We obtained results for the 16 smallest institutions.
(We did these calculations
on a 32-bit operating system, which restricts the network sizes that can be processed.) Both models that we consider are based on a standard ERGM parametrization Pθ{Y = A} = exp{θ · g(A)}/κ(θ) describing the distribution of graphs with
model coeﬃcients θ corresponding to statistics calculated from the adjacency matrix A (with a normalizing factor κ to ensure that the formula yields a probability
distribution) [Frank and Strauss, 1986, Handcock et al., 2008, Lubbers and Snijders,
2007, Robins et al., 2007, Wasserman and Pattison, 1996].
In the ﬁrst model (logistic regression), we include ﬁve statistics (with ﬁve corresponding θ coeﬃcients): the total density of ties (edges) and the common classiﬁcations (nodematch) from each of four node/user characteristics: residence, class
year, major, and high school. For example, the θhighschool contribution describes the
additional log-odds predisposition for a “friendship” tie when two users are from
the same high school. In all cases, we ignore possible contributions from missing
characteristic data: two nodes with the same missing data ﬁeld are not treated as
having the same value for the characteristic. Rather than include gender explicitly
in the model, we instead additionally ﬁt the model to the single-gender subnetworks
in order to be consistent with the treatment of gender in the community-level comparisons below. In the second model (an ERGM), we add a triangle statistic to
account for the observed amount of transitivity in the network data. This gives a
total of six θ coeﬃcients: edges, common residence, common class year, common
major, common high school, and the triangle coeﬃcient.
3.3. Community Detection
The global organization of social networks often includes coexisting modular (horizontal) and hierarchical (vertical) organizational structures, and myriad papers have
attempted to interpret such organization through the computational identiﬁcation
of “community structure.” Communities are deﬁned in terms of cohesive groups
of nodes with more internal connections (between nodes in the same group) than
external connections (between nodes in the group and nodes in other groups). As
discussed at length in two recent review articles [Fortunato, 2010, Porter et al., 2009]
and in references therein, the ensemble of techniques available to detect communities
is both numerous and diverse. Existing techniques include hierarchical clustering
methods such as single linkage clustering, centrality-based methods, local methods,
optimization of quality functions such as modularity and similar quantities, spectral partitioning, likelihood-based methods, and more. Communities are considered
to not be merely structural modules but are also expected to have functional im-
portance because of the large number of common ties among nodes in a community.
For example, communities in social networks might correspond to circles of friends or
business associates and communities in the World Wide Web might encompass pages
on closely-related topics. In addition to remarkable successes on benchmark problems, investigations of community structure have observed correspondence between
communities and “ground truth” groups in diverse application areas—including the
reconstruction of college football conferences [Girvan and Newman, 2002] and the
investigation of such structures in algorithmic rankings [Callaghan et al., 2007]; the
investigation of committee assignments [Porter et al., 2005], legislation cosponsorship
[Zhang et al., 2008], and voting blocs [Mucha et al., 2010, Waugh et al., 2009] in the
United States Congress; the examination of functional groups in metabolic networks
[Guimer`a and Amaral, 2005]; the study of ethnic preferences in school friendship
networks [Gonz´alez et al., 2007]; and the study of social structures in mobile-phone
conversation networks [Onnela et al., 2007]
In the present paper, we investigate the community structures of the Facebook
networks from each of the 100 colleges and universities. (See the visualization of the
community structure for Reed College in Figure 2.) For each institution, we consider the Full, Student, Female, and Male networks. We seek to determine how well
the demographic labels included in the data correspond to algorithmically computed
communities. Assortativity provides a local measure of homophily, but that does
not provide suﬃcient information to draw conclusions about the global organization
of the Facebook networks. For example, two students who attended the same high
school are typically more likely to be friends with each other than are two students
who attended diﬀerent high schools, but this will not necessarily have a meaningful
community-level eﬀect unless enough of the students went to common high schools.
As we we will see below, high school tends to be a much more dominant organizing
characteristic of the social structure at the large institutions than at small institutions, presumably because of a signiﬁcant frequency of common high school pairs at
the large institutions.
We identify communities by optimizing the “modularity” quality function Q =
i ), where eij denotes the fraction of ends of edges in group i for which
the other end of the edge lies in group j and bi = P
j eij is the fraction of all ends
of edges that lie in group i. High values of modularity correspond to community
assignments with greater numbers of intra-community links than expected at random . Although numerous other community detection methods are
also available, modularity optimization is perhaps the most popular way to detect
communities and it has been successfully applied to many applications [Fortunato,
2010, Porter et al., 2009]. One might also consider using a method that includes a
resolution parameter [Reichardt and Bornholdt, 2006] to avoid issues with resolution
limits [Fortunato and Barthelemy, 2007]. However, our primary focus is on global
organization of the networks, so we limit our attention to the default resolution
of modularity. This focus arguably biases our study of communities to the largest
structures, such as those inﬂuenced by common class year, making the observed
correlations with other demographic characteristics even more striking.
To try to ensure that the communities we detect are properties of the data rather
than of the algorithms that we used, we optimize modularity (with default resolution) using 6 diﬀerent combinations of spectral optimization, greedy optimization,
and Kernighan and Lin (KL) node-swapping steps . Speciﬁcally, we use (1) recursive partitioning by the leading
eigenvector of a modularity matrix [Newman, 2006a], (2) recursive partitioning by the
leading pair of eigenvectors , (3) the Louvain greedy method [Blondel et al., 2008],
and each of these three supplemented with small increases in the quality Q that can
be obtained using KL node swaps. Each of these 6 methods yields a community
partition, and we obtain our comparisons (described in Section 3.4) by considering
each of these 6 partitions.
Modularity optimization is NP-hard [Brandes et al., 2008], so one must be cautious about the large number of degenerate partitions in the modularity landscape
[Good et al., 2010].
However, by detecting coarse observables—in particular, the
global organization of a Facebook network based on the given categorical data—and
considering results that are averaged over multiple optimization methods, one can
obtain interesting insights. The speciﬁc “best” partition will vary from one method
to another, but some of the predicted coarse organizational structure of the networks
(see below) is robust to the choice of community detection algorithm.
3.4. Comparing Communities to Node Data
Once we have detected communities for each institution, we will compare the
algorithmically-obtained community structure to the available categorical data for
the nodes. We recently developed a methodology to accomplish this goal in Traud et al.
 (where we considered only 5 institutions among the 100 in order to illustrate
the techniques). This method of comparison can be applied to the output of any
“hard partitioning” algorithm in which each node is assigned to precisely one community (cf. “soft partitioning” methods, in which communities can overlap). We
brieﬂy review that methodology here.
To compare a network partition to the categorical demographic data, we standardize (using a z-score) the Rand coeﬃcient of the communities in that partition
compared to partitioning based purely on each of the four categorical variables (one
at a time). For each comparisons, we calculate the Rand z-score z in terms of the
total number of pairs of nodes in the network M, the number of pairs that are in the
same community M1, the number of pairs that have the same categorical value M2,
and the number of pairs of nodes that are both in the same community and have
the same categorical value w [Traud et al., 2010]. The Rand coeﬃcient is given in
term of these quantities by S = [w + (M −M1 −M2 + w)]/M [Rand, 1971]. We then
calculate the z-score for the Rand coeﬃcient as [Hubert, 1977, Traud et al., 2010]
16 −(4M1 −2M)2(4M2 −2M)2
16n(n −1)(n −2)
+ [(4M1 −2M)2 −4C1 −4M][(4M2 −2M)2 −4C2 −4M]
64n(n −1)(n −2)(n −3)
n is the number of nodes in the network, the coeﬃcients C1 and C2 are given by
C1 = n(n2 −3n −2) −8(n + 1)M1 + 4
C2 = n(n2 −3n −2) −8(n + 1)M2 + 4
nij denotes an element of a contingency table and indicates the number of nodes that
are classiﬁed into the ith group of the ﬁrst partition and the jth group of the second
partition, ni· = P
j nij is a row sum, and n·j = P
i nij is a column sum. Each z-score
indicates the deviation from randomness in comparing the community structure with
the partitioning based purely on that single demographic characteristic. One needs
to be cautious when interpreting such deviations from randomness as a strength
of correlation. In particular, given the dependence on system size inherent in this
measure, one should not overinterpret the relative values of z-scores from diﬀerent
institutions. Nevertheless, the z-scores provide a reasonable proxy quantity both for
the statistical signiﬁcance of correlation and for the relative strength of correlation
in a speciﬁed network.
4. Results
We now use the methods outlined in the previous section to study the Facebook
We ﬁrst follow the order of presentation above and then make some
observations in combinations. Complete results are available in the tables in the
4.1. Assortativity
We tabulate the assortativities based on gender, major, residence, class year, and
high school for all networks (and subsets thereof) in Table A.2.
For almost all of the institutions and each of the 4 network subsets, the class year
attribute produces higher assortativity values than the other available demographic
characteristics. However, Rice University (31), California Institute of Technology
(36), University of Georgia (50), University of Michigan (67), Auburn University
(71), and University of Oklahoma (97) are each examples in which residence provides the highest assortativity values (again, for each of the 4 network subsets). We
discussed Caltech as a focal example in Traud et al. , in which we introduced
the community comparison methods that we employ below.
Other institutions have varying orderings of class year and residence assortativity
among the 4 network subsets. At MIT (8), USF (51), Notre Dame (57), University of
Maine (59), UC (61), UC (64), and MU (78), residence gives the highest assortativity
in the Male networks. The UCF (52) Female network has its highest assortativity
with residence. Both the Full network and the Male network for University of California at Santa Cruz (68) have their highest assortativity values with residence. Both
the Male and Female networks at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (20),
Tulane (29), UC (33), Florida State University (53), Cal (65), University of Mississippi (66), University of Indiana (69), Texas (80), Texas (84), University of Wisconsin
(87), Baylor (93), University of Pennsylvania (94), and University of Tennessee (95)
have their highest assortativity values with residence; all other networks from these
institutions have their highest assortativity with class year.
Some outlying observations can be tied directly to small samples. For example,
Simmons (81) is a female-only college. It has only four males in the Full network;
none of the males had any connections with another male, so the gender assortativity
values for both the Full and Student components are very close to 0. Similar gender
numbers are also present in the data from Wellesley (22) and Smith (60).
4.2. Dyad-Level Regression and Exponential Random Graphs
We use the two statistical models described in Section 3.2 to study the 16 smallest
institutions. The (dyad-independent) logistic regression model includes contributions
from edges (network density) and matched user (node) characteristics for each of
four demographic variables. We present the results for this model in Table A.3. The
second model that we consider is an ERGM, which supplements the ﬁrst model with
a structural triangle contribution. We present the results for this model in Table
A.4. These calculations give views of the networks at the microscropic (dyad-level)
scale that supplement the results that we obtained using the assortativity statistics.
We consider the results from the 16 smallest institutions by ﬁtting the models to
each of their Full, Student, Female, and Male networks. Because all of the resulting model coeﬃcients appear to be statistically signiﬁcant at a p-value of less than
10−4, we interpret the importance of node matching on the diﬀerent demographic
characteristics directly from the magnitude of the corresponding model coeﬃcients.
We summarize the results for these 16 institutions using the box plots in Figures
3 and 4. The box plots identify the outliers by institution number: Caltech (36),
Oberlin (44), Smith (60), Simmons (81), Vassar (85), and Reed (98). (As we have
only performed this regression analysis for the 16 smallest institutions in the data,
one should not jump to conclusions from this list of outliers.) For all institutions
and all four types of networks for each institution, the highest coeﬃcient in the employed ERGM model (with triangle terms) is given for matching the High School
category, and the value of this coeﬃcient is signiﬁcantly higher than those for the
other node-matching coeﬃcients. Only the Caltech (36) Female network has ERGM
coeﬃcients for Year, Residence, and High School that are very close to each other.
4.3. Comparison of Communities
We now discuss community-level results for each network using z-scores of the
Rand coeﬃcient to compare partitions obtained via algorithmic community detection to partitions based on each characteristic. That is, each community-detection
result identiﬁes a group assignment for each node, thereby producing a partition
(called a “hard” partition) in which each node is assigned to exactly one community.
One can also obtain a hard partition for each network by selecting a single characteristic and grouping nodes according to that characteristic. Every network that we study (including the subnetworks) has at least one z-score in the set
{zMajor, zYear, zHS, zResidence} with a value greater than 5. Although the distribution of Rand coeﬃcients is decidedly not Gaussian, particularly in the tails of the
distributions [Brook and Stirling, 1984, Kulisnkaya, 1994, Traud et al., 2010], this
z = 5 threshold indicates that at least one characteristic in each network exhibits
strong statistical signiﬁcance. Moreover, we will see that the vast majority of our
comparisons below exceed the z = 2 threshold. (That is, they essentially lie outside
95% conﬁdence intervals.)
To visualize and compare the varied strengths of organization according to the
diﬀerent demographic characteristics, we represent the four z-scores obtained for
each network (Full, Student, Female, and Male) of an institution using 3-dimensional
barycentric (tetrahedral) coordinates [Franklin, 2002, Weisstein, 2011]. We start by
setting all negative z-scores to 0, as all observed negative z-score values are small
enough to be statistically insigniﬁcant. We then normalize by the sum of the z-scores
zMajor + zYear + zHS + zResidence
zResidence
zMajor + zYear + zHS + zResidence
zMajor + zYear + zHS + zResidence
zMajor + zYear + zHS + zResidence
From these 4 z-score values, we calculate coordinates X = (x1, x2, x3) located inside
a tetrahedron. For example, one can obtain a tetrahedron whose vertices are p1 =
(1, 0, 0), p2 = (cos(2π/3), sin(2π/3), 0), p3 = (cos(4π/3), sin(4π/3), 0), and p4 =
2)) with the transformation
X = (T × Z) + p4 ,
The information from z4 = 1 −(z1 + z2 + z3) is implicitly included in (6) because of
the normalization. Each of the 4 vertices of the tetrahedron corresponds to a limit
in which the corresponding z-score completely dominates the other three z-scores.
That is, at a vertex, the entire z-score sum arises from the corresponding component.
Because of the strong role of class year, we visualize the tetrahedra from a perspective located above the vertex corresponding to class year and project the result
into the opposing face of the tetrahedron. We calculate the point X for each of the
6 algorithmic partitions of each network (i.e., using the aforementioned 6 diﬀerent
community detection methods). For each institution, we plot a disk whose center
lies at the midpoint of these 6 X coordinates. The width of each disk is proportional
to the maximum observed diﬀerence between these 6 sets of coordinates (with these
distances separated into bins of width .1, as indicated in the legends of Figures 5–8).
For example, in Figure 5, the Pepperdine (86) results have a maximum distance of
.0141 between partitions, so Pepperdie (86) is represented by one of the smallest
disks. Harvard (1) has a maximum distance of .1581 between partitions; this lies
in [.1, .2), so Harvard (1) is represented by one of the disks of second smallest size.
We emphasize that the computed diﬀerences are much larger than the span of the
depicted disks, whose sizes allow one to discern the results from diﬀerent institutions.
In Figures 5–8, we show each of the 100 institutions, identiﬁed by number (see
Table A.1), using a disk that we have color-coded according to the Cartesian distance
of its center from the Year vertex. Class year is the predominant organizing category
among the ones present in the data, so most of the institutions are located very close
to the Year vertex. We zoom in on the Year vertex for each ﬁgure in order to better
discern the relative importance of class year at the institutions. Importantly, the
social organization of a few institutions diﬀers considerably from that of the majority.
Each of these institutions lies close to the Residence vertex, so their community
structures are organized predominantly according to dormitory residence. Foremost
among these institutions are Rice (31) and California Institute of Technology (36).
As we discussed in Traud et al. , California Institute of Technology (Caltech)
is well-known to be organized almost exclusively according to its undergraduate
“House” system [Looijen and Porter, 2007].
In repeatedly observing a strong correlation of class year with community structure, it is relevant to recall that the community detection method that we have
employed optimizes modularity at the default resolution. Because of the resolution
limit of modularity [Fortunato and Barthelemy, 2007], it might be interesting to explore individual networks at diﬀerent scales using resolution parameters [Fortunato,
2010, Porter et al., 2009, Reichardt and Bornholdt, 2006]. We reiterate, however,
that our focus in the present paper is on large-scale features rather than precise node
membership of network partitions.
In Figure 5, we show the social organization tetrahedron for the Full networks
(i.e, for the the largest connected components of the complete networks) for each
institution. Although the community structure of nearly all of the Full networks are
organized overwhelmingly by class year, a few of them are also heavily inﬂuenced by
dormitory residence. (We already mentioned above that Rice (31) and Caltech (36)
are organized predominantly by Residence.) For example, dormitory residence also
dominates the community structure at UC Santa Cruz [UCSC] (68), though to a
lesser extent than at Rice and Caltech. We also observe relatively high Residence z-
scores at Smith (60), Auburn (71), and University of Oklahoma (97). Major seems to
be most important relative to the other available characteristics at Oberlin (44) and
Maine (59), though in both cases its relative correlation pales in comparison to that of
class year. High School seems to be most important at USF (51) and Tennessee (95),
though class year is again more important. Most of the institutions are clustered
tightly near the Year vertex, but Residence can often be rather important (and
sometimes even the most important category, as we have seen in three cases).
In Figure 6, we show the social organization tetrahedron for the Student networks
(i.e., for the largest connected component of the student-only subnetworks) for each
institution. As we saw with the Full networks, most of the institutions have community structures that are organized overwhelming according to class year. Rice,
Caltech, Smith, UCSC, Auburn, and Oklahoma are again exceptions, as dormitory
residence also exerts considerable (or even primary) inﬂuence at these institutions.
Additionally, considering the Student network reduces the relative dominance of the
Year vertex, although it clearly still dominates the social organization. This feature
is illustrated by institutions such as UC (64), UF (21), and Rutgers (89).
In Figure 7, we show the social organization tetrahedron for the Female networks
(i.e., for the largest connected component of the female-only subnetworks) for each
institution. Class year is once again the overwhelmingly dominant organizing characteristic, and dormitory residence is again important at institutions such as Rice,
Caltech, Smith, UCSC, Auburn, and Oklahoma. However, we now observe an increased importance of the High School vertex. USF (51), Tennessee (95), UF (21),
FSU (53), and GWU (54) all lie closer to the High School vertex than was the case
in the Full and Student networks.
In Figure 8, we show the social organization tetrahedron for the Male networks
(i.e., for the largest connected component of the male-only subnetworks) for each
institution. Class year is once again the overwhelmingly dominant organizing characteristic, and dormitory residence is again the most important category at institutions such as Rice, Caltech, and UCSC. Interestingly, considering the Male network
suggests that Residence is the most important factor for the social organization for
the males at Notre Dame (57). Residence also exerts an important inﬂuence on the
males at Michigan (67). This is starkly diﬀerent from what we observed for these
institutions in the Full, Student, and Female networks (and would seem to be something interesting to investigate more thoroughly in the future using other data and
methods). The Male UCF (52), MSU (24), USF (51), Auburn (71), and Maine (59)
networks are strongly inﬂuenced by High School. The Male networks at Texas (80),
Rutgers (89), and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (20) stand out from
other universities because of their proximity to the Major vertex.
4.4. Discussion
As described above, we see using the z-scores of the Rand coeﬃcients for demographic characteristics versus algorithmic community assignments that Year is the
strongest organizing factor at most institutions but that Residence is much more
important for the community organization at some institutions than at others. The
correlation with Residence is especially prominent at Rice (31) and Caltech (36).
We also observe that the Male networks tend to be more scattered around Year, as
some institutions exhibit a stronger correlation with Major, whereas others have a
stronger correlation with high school. This suggests that there are potential diﬀerences in the gender patterns of friendships, which would be interesting to investigate
in future studies with new data. We do not explore this general issue further and
instead attempt to identify interesting comparisons with the results that we obtained
above. Although it is of course impossible to be exhaustive in our observations, we
present all of our assortativity values, regression model coeﬃcients, and communitycomparing z-scores in the tables in Appendix A. We also highlight some interesting
facets of our results.
Of particular interest is the comparison of results from the dyad-level regression
models to those from community-level correlations. We note in particular that the
logistic regression and exponential random graph models that we employed for the
smallest 16 institutions specify that almost all institutions and all of their subnetworks give the highest model coeﬃcient contribution towards a link between nodes
from a common High School. However, as we have seen—and which is particularly
evident using the visualizations with tetrahedra—at the community level, most institutions are organized by class year and have a relatively small correlation with
high school.
Even in the rare cases in which the rank ordering of the four correlations (with
Year, Residence, Major, and High School) at the community level matches that obtained via dyad-level model coeﬃcients, such as with the logistic regression model for
the Full and Female networks from Caltech (36), the relative sizes of the contributions at the dyad level are completely diﬀerent from those observed at the community
level. Caltech supplies an illustrative example of the diﬀerent insights obtained from
community-detection versus logistic regression and exponential random graph models
both because of its small size and because of its outlying correlation with dormitory
residence at the community level. A simple interpretation of the apparent dichotomy
between the dyad-level model coeﬃcients and the correlations at the community scale
is that the presence of two students from the same high school at a small institution
like Caltech yields a signiﬁcant increase in the likelihood of a tie between those students. Even though the corresponding model coeﬃcient is smaller than in any of the
other of the 16 smallest institutions, it is comparable to that for common residence
(called “Houses” at Caltech). Nevertheless, the very small number of node pairs at
Caltech that have the same high school relative to the total number of node pairs has
a very small eﬀect at the community level, as the algorithmically obtained communities are correlated overwhelmingly with House aﬃliation. The ERGM result with
triangle contributions makes this distinction even more striking, as the common high
school coeﬃcient is actually larger than the coeﬃcient from common House.
We also observe other features that might be worthy of future investigation using
other data sets and methodologies. We report the results of our calculations in depth
in Tables A.1–A.5. Here we highlight only a few potentially interesting examples in
which diﬀerent methods or diﬀerent subnetworks yield apparently diﬀerent qualitative conclusions. For example, we found that Major is the second most important
factor for the organization of the communities in all of the Oberlin (44) networks,
but only for the Full and Male networks does the logistic regression give the second
highest coeﬃcient for Major. We also observed that the relative ordering of Major at
the same institution is sometimes gender-dependent. For example, Major gives the
second largest z-score in the Female and Male networks of Stanford (3), but it gives
the fourth largest z-score in Stanford’s Full network. Even more interesting, Major
gives the second largest z-score for the Female network at UVA (16), the third largest
z-score for UVA’s Male network, and the fourth largest z-score for its Full network.
The communities in the Auburn (71) Female network are dominated by Residence,
but those in the other Auburn networks are not. Similarly, the communities in the
MIT (8) Male network are dominated by Residence, but those in the other MIT (8)
networks are not. Another interesting disparity based on gender occurs in the communities in the Tennessee (95) Full and Student networks, which have their second
largest contributions from High School, whereas those in the other two Tennessee
networks have their second largest contributions from Residence.
5. Conclusions
We have studied the social structure of Facebook “friendship” networks at one
hundred American institutions at a single point in time . To compare the organizations of the 100 institutions using categorical data,
we considered both microscopic and macroscopic perspectives. In particular, calculating assortativity coeﬃcients and regression model coeﬃcients based on observed
ties allows one to examine homophily at the local level, and algorithmic community
detection allows a complementary macroscopic picture. These approaches complement each other, providing diﬀerent perspectives on investigations of these Facebook
networks. Such complementary calculations are particularly valuable when the microscopic and macroscopic perspectives identify diﬀerent dominant contributions.
For example, in the Caltech networks, the assumed ground truth of the importance
of the House system is captured better by computing community structure.
This “real-world ensemble” of 100 networks formed by ostensibly similar mechanisms has the potential to provide a testing ground for various models of network
formation. Because of the useful comparisons such an ensemble of data can facilitate, this data will similarly be useful for studies of dynamic processes on networks,
algorithmic community detection, and so on. Because of the diﬀerent rates of initial
Facebook adoption at diﬀerent institutions, the single point in time represented by
the data might usefully describe diﬀerent stages in the formation of an online social
network. In order to pursue such ideas further, one needs to start by studying the
networks for their own sake and comparing their structures. This was the goal of the
present paper. In particular, we have identiﬁed some of the key diﬀerences across
these 100 realizations of online social networks.
Some of our observations conﬁrm conventional wisdom or are intuitively clear,
providing soft veriﬁcation of our investigation via expected results. For example,
we found that class year is often important, Houses are important at Caltech, and
high school plays a greater role in the social organization of large universities than
it does at smaller institutions (where there are typically fewer pairs of people from
the same high school). Other results are quite fascinating and merit further investigation. In particular, the diﬀerences in the community structures of the female-only
and male-only networks would be interesting to investigate in both oﬄine and online
settings. The Facebook data suggests that women are typically more likely to have
friends within their common residence (among the demographic data to which we
have access) but that the characteristics in the communities in the male-only net-
works exhibit a wider variation. Investigating this thoroughly would require diﬀerent
data sets and methodologies, especially if one wishes to discern the causes of such
friendships from observed correlations.
The Facebook networks that we study oﬀer imperfect representations of corresponding real-life social networks, which have diﬀerent properties from online social
It is thus crucial that our results are complemented by studies of the
corresponding real networks in order to quantify the extent of such diﬀerences.

Appendix A. Tables
In Table A.1, we give for each of the 100 institutions the numbers of nodes
and edges for each of the Facebook networks (and subsets thereof) that we have
investigated. In Table A.2, we give the assortativity values for each of the networks.
For each institution, we calculate assortativity values for Gender only for the Full
and Student network subsets. We calculate Major, Residence, Year, and High School
assortativity values for each of the four network subsets (Full, Student, Female, and
Recall that we studied regression models for the 16 institutions with the smallest
Facebook networks. In Table A.4, we report the results of a logistic regression model
with edge and nodematch terms.
(All coeﬃcients diﬀer from zero with p-values
less than 1 × 10−4.) In Table A.5, we similarly report the results of an ERGM that
supplements the logistic regression model with triangle terms. (Again, all resulting
model coeﬃcients diﬀer from zero with a p-value of less than 1 × 10−4.)
In Table A.5, we report the maximum z-score for each demographic category that
we obtained from the 6 diﬀerent community detection partitions (described in the
text) of each Facebook network (and their subsets) compared to categorical partitions
based on each of Major, Residence, Year, and High School. We divide the networks
in this table into ﬁve sections: (1) networks for which the High School category gives
the highest z-score; (2) networks for which the Residence category gives the highest
z-score; (3) networks for which Year gives the highest z-score and High School gives
the second highest; (4) networks for which Year gives the highest z-score and Major
gives the second highest; and (5) networks for which Year gives the highest z-score
and Residence gives the second highest.

Table A.3: Logistic regression coeﬃcients for a model combining a
density (edge) term and nodematch contributions for the increased
propensity of two nodes with the same categorical value to have
an edge connected between them. This is calculated individually
for Year, Residence, High School, and Major. We give the standard error for each coeﬃcient in parentheses. All coeﬃcients are
statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero with p-value less than
1×10−4. Wellesley (22), Smith (60), and Simmons (81) are femaleonly institutions, so we list the values for their Male networks as

Table A.4: ERGM coeﬃcients for the model (described in the text) that combines density (edge) and triangle terms with nodematch contributions representing the increased propensity for two nodes with the same categorical value
to have an edge connected between them. (This is calculated individually for
Year, Residence, High School, and Major.) We give the standard error for each
coeﬃcient in parentheses. All coeﬃcients are statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero with p-value less than 1 × 10−4. Wellesley (22), Smith (60), and
Simmons (81) are female-only institutions, so we list the values for their Male
networks as NA.

Table A.5: Maximum z-scores of the Rand coeﬃcient obtained for
the 6 employed community detection algorithms (see the discussion
in the text) for each categorical variable in every network (Full,
Student, Female, and Male) for each of the 100 institutions. We
italicize z-scores that are less than 2.
We divide the table into
ﬁve parts: (1) networks in which High School yields the highest
z-score, (2) networks in which Residence yields the highest z-score,
(3) networks in which Year yields the highest z-score and High
School yields the second highest z-score, (4) networks in which
Year yields the highest z-score and Major yields the second highest
z-score, and (5) networks in which Year yields the highest z-score
and Residence yields the second highest z-score.
