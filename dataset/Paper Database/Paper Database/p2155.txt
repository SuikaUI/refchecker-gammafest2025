This paper addresses deep face recognition (FR) problem under open-set protocol, where ideal face features are
expected to have smaller maximal intra-class distance than
minimal inter-class distance under a suitably chosen metric space. However, few existing algorithms can effectively
achieve this criterion. To this end, we propose the angular
softmax (A-Softmax) loss that enables convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) to learn angularly discriminative features.
Geometrically, A-Softmax loss can be viewed as imposing
discriminative constraints on a hypersphere manifold, which
intrinsically matches the prior that faces also lie on a manifold. Moreover, the size of angular margin can be quantitatively adjusted by a parameter m. We further derive speciﬁc
m to approximate the ideal feature criterion. Extensive analysis and experiments on Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW),
Youtube Faces (YTF) and MegaFace Challenge show the
superiority of A-Softmax loss in FR tasks. The code has also
been made publicly available1.
1. Introduction
Recent years have witnessed the great success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in face recognition (FR).
Owing to advanced network architectures and
discriminative learning approaches , deep CNNs
have boosted the FR performance to an unprecedent level.
Typically, face recognition can be categorized as face identi-
ﬁcation and face veriﬁcation . The former classiﬁes a
face to a speciﬁc identity, while the latter determines whether
a pair of faces belongs to the same identity.
In terms of testing protocol, face recognition can be evaluated under closed-set or open-set settings, as illustrated
in Fig. 1. For closed-set protocol, all testing identities are
predeﬁned in training set. It is natural to classify testing face
images to the given identities. In this scenario, face veriﬁcation is equivalent to performing identiﬁcation for a pair of
faces respectively (see left side of Fig. 1). Therefore, closedset FR can be well addressed as a classiﬁcation problem,

where features are expected to be separable. For open-set
protocol, the testing identities are usually disjoint from the
training set, which makes FR more challenging yet close to
practice. Since it is impossible to classify faces to known
identities in training set, we need to map faces to a discriminative feature space. In this scenario, face identiﬁcation can
be viewed as performing face veriﬁcation between the probe
face and every identity in the gallery (see right side of Fig. 1).
Open-set FR is essentially a metric learning problem, where
the key is to learn discriminative large-margin features.
Desired features for open-set FR are expected to satisfy
the criterion that the maximal intra-class distance is smaller
than the minimal inter-class distance under a certain metric
space. This criterion is necessary if we want to achieve
perfect accuracy using nearest neighbor. However, learning
features with this criterion is generally difﬁcult because of
the intrinsically large intra-class variation and high interclass similarity that faces exhibit.
Few CNN-based approaches are able to effectively formulate the aforementioned criterion in loss functions. PiarXiv:1704.08063v4 [cs.CV] 29 Jan 2018

subset of the CASIA face dataset. In speciﬁc, we set the output dimension of FC1 layer as 2 and visualize the learned features. Yellow dots represent the
ﬁrst class face features, while purple dots represent the second class face features. One can see that features learned by the original softmax loss can not be
classiﬁed simply via angles, while modiﬁed softmax loss can. Our A-Softmax loss can further increase the angular margin of learned features.

not discriminative enough. To address this, some methods
combine softmax loss with contrastive loss or center
loss to enhance the discrimination power of features.
 adopts triplet loss to supervise the embedding learning,
leading to state-of-the-art face recognition results. However,
center loss only explicitly encourages intra-class compactness. Both contrastive loss and triplet loss can not
constrain on each individual sample, and thus require carefully designed pair/triplet mining procedure, which is both
time-consuming and performance-sensitive.
It seems to be a widely recognized choice to impose Euclidean margin to learned features, but a question arises: Is
Euclidean margin always suitable for learning discriminative face features? To answer this question, we ﬁrst look into
how Euclidean margin based losses are applied to FR.
Most recent approaches combine Euclidean
margin based losses with softmax loss to construct a joint
supervision. However, as can be observed from Fig. 2, the
features learned by softmax loss have intrinsic angular distribution (also veriﬁed by ). In some sense, Euclidean
margin based losses are incompatible with softmax loss, so
it is not well motivated to combine these two type of losses.
In this paper, we propose to incorporate angular margin
instead. We start with a binary-class case to analyze the
softmax loss. The decision boundary in softmax loss is
(W1 −W2)x+b1 −b2 =0, where Wi and bi are weights
and bias3 in softmax loss, respectively. If we deﬁne x
as a feature vector and constrain ∥W1∥=∥W2∥=1 and
b1 =b2 =0, the decision boundary becomes ∥x∥(cos(θ1)−
cos(θ2))=0, where θi is the angle between Wi and x. The
new decision boundary only depends on θ1 and θ2. Modiﬁed
softmax loss is able to directly optimize angles, enabling
CNNs to learn angularly distributed features (Fig. 2).
Compared to original softmax loss, the features learned
by modiﬁed softmax loss are angularly distributed, but not
necessarily more discriminative. To the end, we generalize
the modiﬁed softmax loss to angular softmax (A-Softmax)
2Following , we deﬁne the softmax loss as the combination of the
last fully connected layer, softmax function and cross-entropy loss.
3If not speciﬁed, the weights and biases in the paper are corresponding
to the fully connected layer in the softmax loss.
loss. Speciﬁcally, we introduce an integer m (m≥1) to
quantitatively control the decision boundary.
In binaryclass case, the decision boundaries for class 1 and class
2 become ∥x∥(cos(mθ1)−cos(θ2))=0 and ∥x∥(cos(θ1)−
cos(mθ2))=0, respectively. m quantitatively controls the
size of angular margin. Furthermore, A-Softmax loss can be
easily generalized to multiple classes, similar to softmax loss.
By optimizing A-Softmax loss, the decision regions become
more separated, simultaneously enlarging the inter-class margin and compressing the intra-class angular distribution.
A-Softmax loss has clear geometric interpretation. Supervised by A-Softmax loss, the learned features construct a
discriminative angular distance metric that is equivalent to
geodesic distance on a hypersphere manifold. A-Softmax
loss can be interpreted as constraining learned features to
be discriminative on a hypersphere manifold, which intrinsically matches the prior that face images lie on a manifold
 . The close connection between A-Softmax loss
and hypersphere manifolds makes the learned features more
effective for face recognition. For this reason, we term the
learned features as SphereFace.
Moreover, A-Softmax loss can quantitatively adjust the
angular margin via a parameter m, enabling us to do quantitative analysis. In the light of this, we derive lower bounds
for the parameter m to approximate the desired open-set
FR criterion that the maximal intra-class distance should be
smaller than the minimal inter-class distance.
Our major contributions can be summarized as follows:
(1) We propose A-Softmax loss for CNNs to learn discriminative face features with clear and novel geometric
interpretation. The learned features discriminatively span
on a hypersphere manifold, which intrinsically matches the
prior that faces also lie on a manifold.
(2) We derive lower bounds for m such that A-Softmax
loss can approximate the learning task that minimal interclass distance is larger than maximal intra-class distance.
(3) We are the very ﬁrst to show the effectiveness of
angular margin in FR. Trained on publicly available CASIA
dataset , SphereFace achieves competitive results on
several benchmarks, including Labeled Face in the Wild
(LFW), Youtube Faces (YTF) and MegaFace Challenge 1.
2. Related Work
Metric learning. Metric learning aims to learn a similarity (distance) function.
Traditional metric learning
 usually learns a matrix A for a distance metric ∥x1 −x2∥A =
(x1 −x2)T A(x1 −x2) upon the given
features x1, x2. Recently, prevailing deep metric learning
 usually uses neural networks
to automatically learn discriminative features x1, x2 followed by a simple distance metric such as Euclidean distance ∥x1 −x2∥2. Most widely used loss functions for deep
metric learning are contrastive loss and triplet loss
 , and both impose Euclidean margin to features.
Deep face recognition.
Deep face recognition is arguably one of the most active research area in the past few
years. address the open-set FR using CNNs supervised by softmax loss, which essentially treats open-set FR
as a multi-class classiﬁcation problem. combines contrastive loss and softmax loss to jointly supervise the CNN
training, greatly boosting the performance. uses triplet
loss to learn a uniﬁed face embedding. Training on nearly
200 million face images, they achieve current state-of-the-art
FR accuracy. Inspired by linear discriminant analysis, 
proposes center loss for CNNs and also obtains promising
performance. In general, current well-performing CNNs
 for FR are mostly built on either contrastive loss or
triplet loss. One could notice that state-of-the-art FR methods usually adopt ideas (e.g. contrastive loss, triplet loss)
from metric learning, showing open-set FR could be well
addressed by discriminative metric learning.
L-Softmax loss also implicitly involves the concept
of angles. As a regularization method, it shows great improvement on closed-set classiﬁcation problems. Differently,
A-Softmax loss is developed to learn discriminative face embedding. The explicit connections to hypersphere manifold
makes our learned features particularly suitable for open-set
FR problem, as veriﬁed by our experiments. In addition,
the angular margin in A-Softmax loss is explicitly imposed
and can be quantitatively controlled (e.g. lower bounds to
approximate desired feature criterion), while can only
be analyzed qualitatively.
3. Deep Hypersphere Embedding
3.1. Revisiting the Softmax Loss
We revisit the softmax loss by looking into the decision
criteria of softmax loss. In binary-class case, the posterior
probabilities obtained by softmax loss are
1 x + b1) + exp(W T
1 x + b1) + exp(W T
where x is the learned feature vector. Wi and bi are weights
and bias of last fully connected layer corresponding to class
i, respectively.
The predicted label will be assigned to
class 1 if p1 >p2 and class 2 if p1 <p2. By comparing
p1 and p2, it is clear that W T
1 x+b1 and W T
2 x+b2 determine the classiﬁcation result. The decision boundary is
(W1 −W2)x+b1 −b2 =0. We then rewrite W T
i ∥∥x∥cos(θi)+bi where θi is the angle between Wi
and x. Notice that if we normalize the weights and zero
the biases (∥Wi∥=1, bi=0), the posterior probabilities become p1=∥x∥cos(θ1) and p2=∥x∥cos(θ2). Note that p1
and p2 share the same x, the ﬁnal result only depends on
the angles θ1 and θ2. The decision boundary also becomes
cos(θ1)−cos(θ2)=0 (i.e. angular bisector of vector W1 and
W2). Although the above analysis is built on binary-calss
case, it is trivial to generalize the analysis to multi-class case.
During training, the modiﬁed softmax loss (∥Wi∥=1, bi=0)
encourages features from the i-th class to have smaller angle
θi (larger cosine distance) than others, which makes angles
between Wi and features a reliable metric for classiﬁcation.
To give a formal expression for the modiﬁed softmax loss,
we ﬁrst deﬁne the input feature xi and its label yi. The
original softmax loss can be written as
where fj denotes the j-th element (j ∈[1, K], K is the
class number) of the class score vector f, and N is the
number of training samples. In CNNs, f is usually the
output of a fully connected layer W , so fj = W T
and fyi = W T
yixi + byi where xi, Wj, Wyi are the i-th
training sample, the j-th and yi-th column of W respectively.
We further reformulate Li in Eq. (3) as
  e∥Wyi ∥∥xi∥cos(θyi,i)+byi
j e∥Wj∥∥xi∥cos(θj,i)+bj
in which θj,i(0≤θj,i ≤π) is the angle between vector Wj
and xi. As analyzed above, we ﬁrst normalize ∥Wj∥=1, ∀j
in each iteration and zero the biases. Then we have the
modiﬁed softmax loss:
Lmodiﬁed = 1
  e∥xi∥cos(θyi,i)
j e∥xi∥cos(θj,i)
Although we can learn features with angular boundary with
the modiﬁed softmax loss, these features are still not necessarily discriminative. Since we use angles as the distance
metric, it is natural to incorporate angular margin to learned
features in order to enhance the discrimination power. To
this end, we propose a novel way to combine angular margin.
3.2. Introducing Angular Margin to Softmax Loss
Instead of designing a new type of loss function and constructing a weighted combination with softmax loss (similar

to contrastive loss) , we propose a more natural way to learn
angular margin. From the previous analysis of softmax loss,
we learn that decision boundaries can greatly affect the feature distribution, so our basic idea is to manipulate decision
boundaries to produce angular margin. We ﬁrst give a motivating binary-class example to explain how our idea works.
Assume a learned feature x from class 1 is given and θi
is the angle between x and Wi, it is known that the modiﬁed
softmax loss requires cos(θ1)>cos(θ2) to correctly classify
x. But what if we instead require cos(mθ1)>cos(θ2) where
m≥2 is a integer in order to correctly classify x? It is
essentially making the decision more stringent than previous, because we require a lower bound4 of cos(θ1) to be
larger than cos(θ2). The decision boundary for class 1 is
cos(mθ1)=cos(θ2). Similarly, if we require cos(mθ2)>
cos(θ1) to correctly classify features from class 2, the decision boundary for class 2 is cos(mθ2)=cos(θ1). Suppose
all training samples are correctly classiﬁed, such decision
boundaries will produce an angular margin of m−1
2 is the angle between W1 and W2. From angular perspective, correctly classifying x from identity 1 requires
m, while correctly classifying x from identity 2 requires θ2 < θ1
m . Both are more difﬁcult than original θ1 <θ2
and θ2 <θ1, respectively. By directly formulating this idea
into the modiﬁed softmax loss Eq. (5), we have
 e∥xi∥cos(mθyi,i)
e∥xi∥cos(mθyi,i) + P
j̸=yi e∥xi∥cos(θj,i)
where θyi,i has to be in the range of [0, π
m]. In order to
get rid of this restriction and make it optimizable in CNNs,
we expand the deﬁnition range of cos(θyi,i) by generalizing it to a monotonically decreasing angle function ψ(θyi,i)
which should be equal to cos(θyi,i) in [0, π
m]. Therefore, our
proposed A-Softmax loss is formulated as:
 e∥xi∥ψ(θyi,i)
e∥xi∥ψ(θyi,i) + P
j̸=yi e∥xi∥cos(θj,i)
in which we deﬁne ψ(θyi,i)=(−1)k cos(mθyi,i)−2k,
θyi,i ∈[ kπ
m , (k+1)π
] and k∈[0, m −1]. m≥1 is an integer that controls the size of angular margin. When m=1, it
becomes the modiﬁed softmax loss.
The justiﬁcation of A-Softmax loss can also be made from
decision boundary perspective. A-Softmax loss adopts different decision boundary for different class (each boundary

is more stringent than the original), thus producing angular
margin. The comparison of decision boundaries is given in
Table 1. From original softmax loss to modiﬁed softmax
loss, it is from optimizing inner product to optimizing angles.
From modiﬁed softmax loss to A-Softmax loss, it makes
the decision boundary more stringent and separated. The
angular margin increases with larger m and be zero if m=1.
Supervised by A-Softmax loss, CNNs learn face features
with geometrically interpretable angular margin. Because A-
Softmax loss requires Wi =1, bi =0, it makes the prediction
only depends on angles between the sample x and Wi. So
x can be classiﬁed to the identity with smallest angle. The
parameter m is added for the purpose of learning an angular
margin between different identities.
To facilitate gradient computation and back propagation,
we replace cos(θj,i) and cos(mθyi,i) with the expressions
only containing W and xi, which is easily done by deﬁnition of cosine and multi-angle formula (also the reason why
we need m to be an integer). Without θ, we can compute
derivative with respect to x and W , similar to softmax loss.
3.3. Hypersphere Interpretation of A-Softmax Loss
A-Softmax loss has stronger requirements for a correct
classiﬁcation when m≥2, which generates an angular classi-
ﬁcation margin between learned features of different classes.
A-Softmax loss not only imposes discriminative power to
the learned features via angular margin, but also renders nice
and novel hypersphere interpretation. As shown in Fig. 3,
A-Softmax loss is equivalent to learning features that are
discriminative on a hypersphere manifold, while Euclidean
margin losses learn features in Euclidean space.
To simplify, We take the binary case to analyze the hypersphere interpretation. Considering a sample x from class 1
and two column weights W1, W2, the classiﬁcation rule for
A-Softmax loss is cos(mθ1)>cos(θ2), equivalently mθ1 <
θ2. Notice that θ1, θ2 are equal to their corresponding arc
length ω1, ω25 on unit hypersphere {vj, ∀j| P
j =1, v≥0}.
Because ∥W ∥1 =∥W ∥2 =1, the decision replies on the arc
length ω1 and ω2. The decision boundary is equivalent to
mω1 =ω2, and the constrained region for correctly classifying x to class 1 is mω1 <ω2. Geometrically speaking, this
is a hypercircle-like region lying on a hypersphere manifold.
For example, it is a circle-like region on the unit sphere in
3D case, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Note that larger m leads to
smaller hypercircle-like region for each class, which is an explicit discriminative constraint on a manifold. For better understanding, Fig. 3 provides 2D and 3D visualizations. One
can see that A-Softmax loss imposes arc length constraint on
a unit circle in 2D case and circle-like region constraint on a
unit sphere in 3D case. Our analysis shows that optimizing
angles with A-Softmax loss essentially makes the learned
features more discriminative on a hypersphere.
3.4. Properties of A-Softmax Loss
Property 1. A-Softmax loss deﬁnes a large angular margin learning task with adjustable difﬁculty. With larger m,
the angular margin becomes larger, the constrained region
on the manifold becomes smaller, and the corresponding
learning task also becomes more difﬁcult.
We know that the larger m is, the larger angular margin
A-Softmax loss constrains. There exists a minimal m that
constrains the maximal intra-class angular distance to be
smaller than the minimal inter-class angular distance, which
can also be observed in our experiments.
Deﬁnition 1 (minimal m for desired feature distribution).
mmin is the minimal value such that while m > mmin, A-
Softmax loss deﬁnes a learning task where the maximal intraclass angular feature distance is constrained to be smaller
than the minimal inter-class angular feature distance.
Property 2 (lower bound of mmin in binary-class case). In
binary-class case, we have mmin ≥2+
Proof. We consider the space spaned by W1 and W2. Because m≥2, it is easy to obtain the maximal angle that class
1 spans is
m+1 where θ12 is the angle between W1
and W2. To require the maximal intra-class feature angular
distance smaller than the minimal inter-class feature angular
distance, we need to constrain

5ωi is the shortest arc length (geodesic distance) between Wi and the
projected point of sample x on the unit hypersphere, while the corresponding θi is the angle between Wi and x.
After solving these two inequalities, we could have mmin ≥
3, which is a lower bound for binary case.
Property 3 (lower bound of mmin in multi-class case). Under the assumption that Wi, ∀i are uniformly spaced in the
Euclidean space, we have mmin ≥3.
Proof. We consider the 2D k-class (k ≥3) scenario for the
lower bound. Because Wi, ∀i are uniformly spaced in the
2D Euclidean space, we have θi+1
k where θi+1
angle between Wi and Wi+1. Since Wi, ∀i are symmetric,
we only need to analyze one of them. For the i-th class (Wi),
We need to constrain

min inter-class angle
After solving this inequality, we obtain mmin ≥3, which is
a lower bound for multi-class case.
Based on this, we use m=4 to approximate the desired
feature distribution criteria. Since the lower bounds are not
necessarily tight, giving a tighter lower bound and a upper
bound under certain conditions is also possible, which we
leave to the future work. Experiments also show that larger
m consistently works better and m=4 will usually sufﬁce.
3.5. Discussions
Why angular margin. First and most importantly, angular margin directly links to discriminativeness on a manifold,
which intrinsically matches the prior that faces also lie on
a manifold. Second, incorporating angular margin to softmax loss is actually a more natural choice. As Fig. 2 shows,
features learned by the original softmax loss have an intrinsic angular distribution. So directly combining Euclidean
margin constraints with softmax loss is not reasonable.
Comparison with existing losses. In deep FR task, the
most popular and well-performing loss functions include
contrastive loss, triplet loss and center loss. First, they only
impose Euclidean margin to the learned features (w/o normalization), while ours instead directly considers angular margin
which is naturally motivated. Second, both contrastive loss
and triplet loss suffer from data expansion when constituting
the pairs/triplets from the training set, while ours requires no
sample mining and imposes discriminative constraints to the
entire mini-batches (compared to contrastive and triplet loss
that only affect a few representative pairs/triplets).

CNNs Setup. Caffe is used to implement A-Softmax
loss and CNNs. The general framework to train and extract
SphereFace features is shown in Fig. 4. We use residual
units in our CNN architecture. For fairness, all compared
methods use the same CNN architecture (including residual
units) as SphereFace. CNNs with different depths (4, 10, 20,
36, 64) are used to better evaluate our method. The speciﬁc
settings for difffernt CNNs we used are given in Table 2.
According to the analysis in Section 3.4, we usually set m
as 4 in A-Softmax loss unless speciﬁed. These models are
trained with batch size of 128 on four GPUs. The learning
rate begins with 0.1 and is divided by 10 at the 16K, 24K
iterations. The training is ﬁnished at 28K iterations.

Training Data. We use publicly available web-collected
training dataset CASIA-WebFace (after excluding the
images of identities appearing in testing sets) to train our
CNN models. CASIA-WebFace has 494,414 face images
belonging to 10,575 different individuals. These face images
are horizontally ﬂipped for data augmentation. Notice that
the scale of our training data (0.49M) is relatively small, especially compared to other private datasets used in DeepFace
 (4M), VGGFace (2M) and FaceNet (200M).
Testing. We extract the deep features (SphereFace) from
the output of the FC1 layer. For all experiments, the ﬁnal
representation of a testing face is obtained by concatenating
its original face features and its horizontally ﬂipped features.
The score (metric) is computed by the cosine distance of two
features. The nearest neighbor classiﬁer and thresholding
are used for face identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation, respectively.
4.2. Exploratory Experiments
Effect of m. To show that larger m leads to larger angular margin (i.e. more discriminative feature distribution
on manifold), we perform a toy example with different m.
We train A-Softmax loss with 6 individuals that have the
most samples in CASIA-WebFace. We set the output feature
dimension (FC1) as 3 and visualize the training samples in
Fig. 5. One can observe that larger m leads to more discriminative distribution on the sphere and also larger angular
margin, as expected. We also use class 1 (blue) and class
2 (dark green) to construct positive and negative pairs to
evaluate the angle distribution of features from the same
class and different classes. The angle distribution of positive
and negative pairs (the second row of Fig. 5) quantitatively
shows the angular margin becomes larger while m increases
and every class also becomes more distinct with each other.
Besides visual comparison, we also perform face recognition on LFW and YTF to evaluate the effect of m. For fair
comparison, we use 64-layer CNN (Table 2) for all losses.
Results are given in Table 3. One can observe that while
m becomes larger, the accuracy of A-Softmax loss also becomes better, which shows that larger angular margin can
bring stronger discrimination power.

Effect of CNN architectures. We train A-Softmax loss
(m=4) and original softmax loss with different number
of convolution layers. Speciﬁc CNN architectures can be
found in Table 2. From Fig. 6, one can observe that A-
Softmax loss consistently outperforms CNNs with softmax
loss (1.54%∼1.91%), indicating that A-Softmax loss is more
suitable for open-set FR. Besides, the difﬁcult learning task

intersection points of the feature vectors and the unit sphere. The second row shows the angle distribution of both positive pairs and negative pairs (we choose

deﬁned by A-Softmax loss makes full use of the superior
learning capability of deeper architectures. A-Softmax loss
greatly improve the veriﬁcation accuracy from 98.20% to
99.42% on LFW, and from 93.4% to 95.0% on YTF. On
the contrary, the improvement of deeper standard CNNs is
unsatisfactory and also easily get saturated (from 96.60% to
97.75% on LFW, from 91.1% to 93.1% on YTF).

4.3. Experiments on LFW and YTF
LFW dataset includes 13,233 face images from 5749
different identities, and YTF dataset includes 3,424
videos from 1,595 different individuals. Both datasets contains faces with large variations in pose, expression and
illuminations. We follow the unrestricted with labeled outside data protocol on both datasets. The performance of
SphereFace are evaluated on 6,000 face pairs from LFW and
5,000 video pairs from YTF. The results are given in Table 4.
For contrastive loss and center loss, we follow the FR convention to form a weighted combination with softmax loss.
The weights are selected via cross validation on training set.
For L-Softmax , we also use m=4. All the compared

loss functions share the same 64-layer CNN architecture.
Most of the existing face veriﬁcation systems achieve
high performance with huge training data or model ensemble. While using single model trained on publicly available
dataset (CAISA-WebFace, relatively small and having noisy
labels), SphereFace achieves 99.42% and 95.0% accuracies
on LFW and YTF datasets. It is the current best performance
trained on WebFace and considerably better than the other
models trained on the same dataset. Compared with models
trained on high-quality private datasets, SphereFace is still
very competitive, outperforming most of the existing results
in Table 4. One should notice that our single model performance is only worse than Google FaceNet which is trained
with more than 200 million data.

consistently outperforms the features learned by all these
compared losses, showing its superiority in FR tasks.
4.4. Experiments on MegaFace Challenge
MegaFace dataset is a recently released testing benchmark with very challenging task to evaluate the performance
of face recognition methods at the million scale of distractors.
MegaFace dataset contains a gallery set and a probe set. The
gallery set contains more than 1 million images from 690K
different individuals. The probe set consists of two existing
datasets: Facescrub and FGNet. MegaFace has several
testing scenarios including identiﬁcation, veriﬁcation and
pose invariance under two protocols (large or small training
set). The training set is viewed as small if it is less than
0.5M. We evaluate SphereFace under the small training set
protocol. We adopt two testing protocols: face identiﬁcation
and veriﬁcation. The results are given in Fig. 7 and Tabel
5. Note that we use simple 3-patch feature concatenation
ensemble as the ﬁnal performance of SphereFace.
Fig. 7 and Tabel 5 show that SphereFace (3 patches ensemble) beats the second best result by a large margins (4.8%
for rank-1 identiﬁcation rate and 6.3% for veriﬁcation rate)
on MegaFace benchmark under the small training dataset
protocol. Compared to the models trained on large dataset
(500 million for Google and 18 million for NTechLAB), our
method still performs better (0.64% for id. rate and 1.4%
for veri. rate). Moreover, in contrast to their sophisticated
network design, we only employ typical CNN architecture
supervised by A-Softamx to achieve such excellent performance. For single model SphereFace, the accuracy of face
identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation are still 72.73% and 85.56%
respectively, which already outperforms most state-of-theart methods. For better evaluation, we also implement the
softmax loss, contrastive loss, center loss, triplet loss and L-
Softmax loss . Compared to these loss functions trained
with the same CNN architecture and dataset, SphereFace also
shows signiﬁcant and consistent improvements. These results convincingly demonstrate that the proposed SphereFace
is well designed for open-set face recognition. One can also
see that learning features with large inter-class angular margin can signiﬁcantly improve the open-set FR performance.
5. Concluding Remarks
This paper presents a novel deep hypersphere embedding
approach for face recognition. In speciﬁc, we propose the
angular softmax loss for CNNs to learn discriminative face
features (SphereFace) with angular margin. A-Softmax loss
renders nice geometric interpretation by constraining learned
features to be discriminative on a hypersphere manifold,
which intrinsically matches the prior that faces also lie on
a non-linear manifold. This connection makes A-Softmax
very effective for learning face representation. Competitive
results on several popular face benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority and great potentials of our approach. We also
believe A-Softmax loss could also beneﬁt some other tasks
like object recognition, person re-identiﬁcation, etc.
