METRIC SPACES AND POSITIVE DEFINITE
FUNCTIONS*
I. J. SCHOENBERG
1. Introduction. Let Em denote the w-dimensional
generally Emp the pseudo-euclidean
space of m real variables with the distance
(\ Xl - X{ \" + ■ ■ ■ + I Xm - Xni I")1'",
» we get the space E„ with the distance function max,-=i,... ,m | x< — as/ |.
Let, furthermore,
lp stand for the space of real sequences with the series of
pth powers of the absolute values convergent.
Similarly let Lp denote the
space of real measurable
functions in the interval
(0, 1) which are oummable
to the ^»th power, while C shall mean the space of real continuous
in the same interval. In all these spaces a distance function is assumed to be
defined as usual, f L2 is equivalent
to the real Hubert space ÍQ. The spaces
Emp, lp, and Lp are metric only if ^»^1, but we shall consider them also for
positive values of ^»<1. Finally, if © is a (not necessarily metric) space with
the distance function PP', we shall denote by ©(7) the new space which arises
by changing the distance function from PP' to PP'y,
A general theorem of Banach and Mazur
( , p. 187) states that any
separable metric space @ may be imbedded isometrically
in the space C. Furthermore, as a special case of a well known theorem of Urysohn, any such
space © may be imbedded
topologically in §. Isometric imbeddability
in § is, however, a much more restricted property of ©.
The chief purpose of this paper is to point out the intimate
relationship
between the problem of isometric imbedding and the concept of positive definite functions, if this concept is properly enlarged. As a first approach to this
connection we consider here isometric imbedding
space only. It
turns out that the possibility of imbeddingj
in § is very easily expressible
in terms of the elementary
e-'2 and the concept of positive definite
functions (Theorem 1). The author's
previous result ( ) to the effect that

fractional power, is imbeddable in £>,* appears again as a simple consequence
(Corollary
1). For the class of spaces ©m arising from the euclidean space Em
by a general change of metric of the vector type (11) below, the condition of
imbeddability
in ^j is directly expressible
in a simple way in terms of the
usual concept of positive definite functions
as described by Mathias
Bochner (Theorem 2). The solution of this problem for m = 1 (the problem of
"screw lines" in §, von Neumann
and Schoenberg
 ) allows us now to derive purely analytical
results in the theory of positive definite functions with
which it is equivalent.
Two readily defined classes of positive definite functions are completely
determined
3 and 4). In particular
proofs are given for the already known fact that the function exp [— |x| p]
is positive definite for values of p in the range 0<p^2,
and not positive
definite if ¿>>2f (§5). One proof is geometrical,
the other proof covering the
case 0<p^2
is analytical
and may be read independently
of the rest of this
All previous results now allow us to conclude that the spaces Emp (y), lp(y),.
and 7p(7) are imbeddable
in § for values of y in the range 0 <y ^ p/2, where
p is restricted
to the range 0<p^2
5). For p = 2 we regain our
previous result concerning
It is interesting
to compare and combine
this result about Lp with a theoem of Banach and Mazur ( , p. 203) concerning the linear dimensions
of L2 and L". According
to this theorem IPis imbeddable in L" if q > 1. Now as 7>(7), (0 <p ^2, 0 <y ^p/2), is imbeddable in £ or 72, it follows that L"(y), (0<p^2,
is imbeddable in
any L" if q > 1.
Similar as yet unsolved problems concerning the case of p > 2 are shown
to be equivalent
to further knowledge as to the positive definite character
certain special functions of m variables. One of these unsolved problems suggests a probably possible way of extending
an interesting
theorem of L. M.

interested
in the geometrical
results of this paper

x2, • • • , xm)
which is defined for all real values of its variables and is even, that is for which
/( —xi, • • • , —xm)=f(xi,
• • • , xm), is said to be positive

for arbitrary
real pt and any n points (x(i)), (¿= 1, • • • , m), for m = 2, 3, • ■ • .
For m — 2, (1) gives |/(xx, • • • , xm)| ä=/(0, ■ • • , 0), hence p.d. functions
throughout
space and take their maximum
value at the origin. We
shall use in the sequel only the following most simple properties
of this interesting class of functions.
I. The function defined by
I iKwi, •••,«»)
• exp [¿(xi«i
• • • + xmum)]dui
■ ■ ■ dum,
where \p is a non-negative
even function such that its integral over the whole
space exists, is p. d.
II. Any finite linear combination
of p.d. functions with non-negative
coefficients is again p.d. The product of two p.d. functions is again p.d.
III. A continuous
function which is the limit of a sequence of p.d. functions is itself p.d.
For completeness
we sketch the simple proofs. Property
I follows from
the fact that the left-hand
side of (1) reduces to
" " I \2~2 Pk exp [¿(xi ui + ■ ■ ■ + xm um)]
pdui ■ ■ ■ dum ^ 0.
The additive property is clear from the fact that (1) is a linear inequality
The multiplicative
is a direct consequence
of a lemma of I. Schur
( ,p. 10)* which states that if Xa aikpipk, Xa bikpiPk, are two positive quadratic forms, then 2^2" aikbikPiPk is also positive.
III is immediately
clear by continuity.
We shall later on use the fact that f(x) =cos Xx is a p.d.
A closely allied concept is as follows. Let © be a space in which a distance
function PP'is
defined subject to the following conditions:
for arbitrary
points P, P' in @, (2) PP=0.
A real continuous
even function
g(t), which is defined in the range of values of ±PP',
(P, P' in ©), is said to
be positive definite in © if
g(PlPk)piPk ^ 0
for arbitrary
real p¿ and any m points P, (different or not) of ©,(« = 2,3, • • •)•
* For a discussion and consequences of Schur's result see also Pólya and Szegö , pp. 106-107,
METRIC SPACES
This class of functions g(t) has for a given space © properties II and III above
for similar reasons. Both definitions agree if m = 1, while © is the one-dimensional euclidean space E\.
The peculiar relationship
between the definitions,
which will be clearer
later on, is already exhibited by the following simple example needed in the
sequel. From the formula
= 2-V-1'* f
we get, replacing x by Xj, (j = 1, • • • , m), and multiplying
the resulting equations,
• • • + x*2)]
■ • • + xj)»2}2}
= 2-m7r-""2 f
f exp [¿(xi«i H-+
• exp [— («i2 + ■ • ■ + u¿)/4]dui
■ ■ ■ dum,
which shows at a glance (property I) that the function
is p.d. and also that g(t) =e~'2 is p.d. in Em. As m is arbitrary,
this implies
that the function e~' is positive definite in the real Hilbert space §.
3. Conditions for isometric imbedding in Hilbert space in terms of positive
definite functions. It was pointed out by K. Menger and by the author
references see ) that a necessary and sufficient condition that a separable
space © be imbeddable in § is that for any «+1 points of ©, (« = 2), we have
£ (FoF? + PWk - PlPk2)piPk = 0,
for arbitrary
real p,.* Let us now put this condition
in a slightly more symmetrical form. By summing over the three terms separately,
we may write
2^Z Pk- Z PoTk2Pk - Z PlPkPiPk = o,
* This was proved for the case when © is a separable semi-metric space; that is, when the metric
satisfies the additional condition
whereas we postulated
only that (1)
PP' = P'P^0,
our quadratic
inequality,
for n = 2, insures the triangle inequality PQ+QR^PR
for any three points of ©. If we now identify with P all points Q such that
(which is now allowed, since PQ=0
implies RP = RQ for any R, on account of the triangle
inequality) and do this for all points of ©, we get a new space which is not only semi-metric but even
I. J. SCHOENBERG
and if we set p0= — S"p*, this last inequality
is equivalent
- p„27VP„2 - 22Z PÜPkPoPk - Z P¡P7piPk è o,
or, finally,
P~P¿PiPk ^ 0.
Hence the inequality
(5), as a consequence
of the relation
is equivalent to the above stated condition of imbeddability.
Now we are prepared to express this condition in terms of p.d. functions.
We have seen in the previous section that the function e~'2 is p.d. in §.
Clearly also e~x2'2 (X real) is p.d. in § as can be seen from (4) or by direct
reasoning. Hence e-*2'2 is also p.d. in any subset of §. Now if © is to be imbeddable in §, it is clearly a necessary condition that e-*2'2 be p.d. in ©.
Let us prove now that this condition,
together with the separability
is also sufficient. To prove this we have to show that (5) holds as a consequence of (6) for any m+1 points Pi of ©. Now as e~x2'2 is p.d. in ©, we have
£ Pipk exp [- X27V\2] è 0
by (3). We complete the proof in two different ways.
First proof. By expanding
the left-hand
side of (7) in power series we
have, in view of (6),
0 < a < 2,t^
which are immediately
proved by substituting
in the first integral X/_1 for X,
PiPk'piPk")
PiPkAPiPk\2
which clearly implies (5) for small values of X.
Second proof. Using the formulas
t" = c(a) f (1 - e-^'^X-^dX,
c(a) = U (1 - e-x2)X-WxJ ,
METRIC SPACES
P.-7V = c(a) f (1 - exp [- \2P\P?])\-i-"d\.
If now pi are any real numbers satisfying (6), we get, for 0<cv<2,
(9) £ PlPkttpiPk = - c(a) f {£
PiPk exp [- X2P¡P?]}x-1-«¿X = 0,
by (7) and the obvious fact that c(a)>0.
Now we get again the desired inequality (5) on allowing a in (9) to approach the limit 2. We have thus proved
the following theorem :
1. A necessary and sufficient condition that a separable space ©
with a distance function PP' with the properties PP' =P'P^0,
PP = 0, be isometrically imbeddable in ¿p, is that the family of functions e~xi, (X>0), be positive definite in ©.
Notice that the condition of this theorem may be restricted to require that
e~xt* be p.d. in © only for a set of positive values of X admitting
the origin
X = 0 as a point of accumulation.
The properties II and III (§2) will then imply that e_x'2 is p.d. in © for all positive values of X.
Recalling that we denote by ©(7), (7>0),
the space obtained from © by
replacing its metric PP' by PP'y, it is of interest to point out the further fact,
implicitly contained in the previous second proof, that if © is imbeddable
£>, then so is ©(7) for any value of 7 in the range 0 <y < 1. Indeed, let a = 27;
if © is imbeddable in §, then e~Xi2, (X>0), is p. d. in ©; hence (9) holds
in virtue of (6), and ©(7) is therefore imbeddable
in § on account of the form
(5) of the imbeddability
condition.
Applying this conclusion to © = § itself,
we have the following corollary:
1. The space ¡£>(y), (0<7<1),
obtained from Hilbert space §
by raising its metric to a power y, is imbeddable in §.*
* We may even state the following more general theorem: Let
F(t)= f"(l - e-^X-'ArpO,
where <r(X) is non-decreasing for X g 0 and is such that f, X_2á<r(X) exists. If we change the metrif of $
from PP' to [F(PP')]1'2! lnen the new space thus arising is imbeddable in &. Indeed (6), (7), and (8')
¿ F(PlPk)f>iPi.
- - f ( £ p,p* exp [- X^pTp?]) X-W(X) S 0,
''O \i,*-l
and the theorem follows on account of the form (5) and (6) of the imbeddability
condition. We leave
open the question whether or not (8') gives the most general function F(t) with this property.
Added in proof, August, 1938: Formula (8') gives indeed all functions with the property stated
above. See the following paper Metric spaces and completely monotone functions,
to appear in the
Annals of Mathematics.
I. J. SCHOENBERG
We now turn our attention
to a special class of spaces of the type © which
are defined as follows. Let <j>(xi, ■ ■ ■ , xm) be a continuous
function defined for
all real values of its variables with the following properties
0(xi, • • • , xm) = 0, tf>(0, • • • , 0) = 0,
<t>(— xi, ■ ■ ■ , — xm) = <t>(xi, ■ ■ ■ , xm);
and call ©m the space of points P = (xi, ■ ■ ■ , xm) with the distance function
= [<t>(xi -
x[, ■ ■ ■ , xm -
For such a space, which is obviously separable, the condition of Theorem 1
that e_x<2 be p.d. in ©m may be expressed
in a more familiar form. Indeed,
on comparing the formulas (1), (3), and (11), we now obtain from Theorem 1
the following theorem :
2. The space ©m of m real numbers with the metric (11) is imbeddable in § if and only if the functions
/x = exp [— X<p(xx, ■•-,*»)],
are positive definite in the sense (1) of Mathias
and Bochner for all positive
values of X.
If <p(xx, ■ • • , xm) is a homogeneous function*
the conditions
(12) may be
replaced by the single condition that the function
/i = exp [- <b(xi, ■ ■ ■ , xm)\
be positive definite.
We mention the following corollary :
2. If <p(xi, ■ ■ ■ , xm) is homogeneous and such that e~+ is positive definite, then
is also positive definite.
For if er* is p.d., then by Theorem 2, ©m is imbeddable
in § and therefor ©m(7) is also (Corollary
exp [—<py] is seen to be p.d. by
applying Theorem 2 the other way around.

of certain classes of positive definite functions.
section we shall assume m = \,<p(x) being therefore a continuous non-negative
even function vanishing at the origin. In this case we know precisely when ©i,
* We say that <i> is homogeneous of degree k if <t>(txx, • ■ ■ , txm) =lK<t>(xx, • • • , x„) holds identically
in the Xi and for />0. A continuous homogeneous function <j> with the properties (10) must, unless it
vanishes identically, have a positive degree k.
METRIC SPACES
which is the space of real numbers with the metric [</>(x—x') ]1/2 is imbeddable
in § (von Neumann
and Schoenberg
 ). The most general function </>(x)
for which this is the case is of the form
' sin'' xu
where <t(u) is non-decreasing
for u^O such that
Hence by Theorem 2 we infer that if
[f(x)Y = e-^M
is p.d. for X>0, then <p(x) is of the form (14) and conversely.
If now/(x)
any positive function whose positive powers [/(x)]x are all p.d., then considering
where cp(x) is necessarily
non-negative,
even, and vanishing
at the origin, we
conclude as before that <p(x) is of the form (14). We have thus proved the
following theorem :
3. The most general positive function f(x) whose positive powers
[f(x)]x, (X>0), are all positive definite is of the form
f(x) = exp Y - J -—
where <r(u) is a non-decreasing function subject to the restriction
(15), while c is
any real constant.
A few remarks are called for regarding the condition of this theorem that
\j(x) Y be p.d. for X >0. In the first place, as remarked
after the statement
Theorem 1, the range of X in this condition may be restricted to a sequence
of positive numbers tending to zero.
A second and more important
remark is that Theorem 3 becomes false if
we assume only that the positive function f(x) is p.d., or in other words:
(16) always represents
a positive
and p.d. function;
it does not,
however, represent all such functions but only those whose fractional powers
are also p. d. To prove this statement
it suffices to exhibit a p.d. function
f(x) >0 such that [/(x)]\
are not all p.d. Such a function is
= e2 + cos2 x,
I. J. SCHOENBERG
if e is sufficiently small, for it is easy to see that
[/■,(*)]!/*
= (e2 + cos2 x)1'2
is not p.d. for such values of e. Indeed, if it were p.d. for arbitrarily
it would follow that the limiting function
lim [/«(*)]1/2 = | cos x |
were also p.d. (property
III). But this is not the case as is seen from the
fact that the cosine series
, i 2 4 " cos 2wx
has some negative coefficients, or even more directly from the fact that the
23 I COS (Xi — Xk) I pipk,
where xi = 0, x2=ir/A, x3=ir/2, x4 = 37r/4, is not positive. Indeed, its determinant is readily found to be — 1, hence negative.
The essence of the matter
Schur's theorem,
"If 23a<*P>P* is positive,
then so is 23a«P<P* for
m = 1, 2, 3, • • ■ ," can not be so extended
we may conclude
231 aik\ xPiPk, (X>0), is positive.
The third and last remark is that Theorem 3 is now equivalent
theorem that (14) and (15) give the most general <p(x) such that the space
of real numbers with the metric [<p(x — x')]U2 be imbeddable
in £> (see ).
Hence a direct proof of Theorem 3 would furnish a new proof of that theorem.
While the problem of determining
all positive and positive definite functions is yet unsolved, there is another subclass of this class of functions which
can now be readily determined.
It will in fact be a subclass of the class determined by Theorem 3.
Let yp(x) be a p.d. function, c a real constant.
(17) /(*) = exp [c + p(x)] - e'(l + — *(x) + —V(x) + ■ • • J
is also p.d. in virtue
of the properties
II and III.
It has moreover
following additional
two properties:
(a) It is bounded away from zero, since
[c—\p(0)]>0.
(ß) All its positive powers [/(x)]\
(X>0), are also
p.d. Let us show that the converse is true, that any function f(x) having
the properties
(a) and (ß) is of the form (17) where ij/(x) is p.d. Now an/(x)
with the properties
(a) and (ß) clearly belongs to the class described by Theo-
METRIC SPACES
rem 3, and all we have to do is to decide which functions of the form (16) are
bounded away from zero. Now this is the case if and only if the exponent (14),
*(*) = I -7—d°(u)
is bounded in — oo <x< °o. The characteristic
conditions
for this have likewise been determined
by von Neumann
and the author in and they are
as follows: <p(x) is bounded if and only if a(0)=a(+0)
and f^,u~2do-(u) exists.
But if these conditions
are fulfilled, then the non-decreasing
■ +o Wis bounded for u>0,
and (14) can be written as
J* sin2 xu
= I sin2 xudr(u)
-i-n U2 J -hi
— I (1 - cos 2xu)dr(u) = ip(0) - ib(x),
cos 2uxdr(u)
is p.d. Hence, by (14), (18), and (16),
= exp [c - <p(x)] = exp [c - yp(0) + \b(x)]
and is indeed of the desired form (17). We have thus proved the following
4. The most general positive function f(x) which is bounded away
from zero and whose positive powers \f(x) ]\ (X >0), are positive definite is of the
f(x) = exp [c + \b(x) ],
where \p(x) is positive definite and c is a real constant.
Equivalent
Statement:
is a positive function, then log/(x)
by a constant from a positive definite function if and only iff(x) is bounded away
from zero and its powers [/(x)]x, (X>0), are all positive definite.
5. On the positive definite character of exp [ — | x| "]. We shall need in the
next section the following well known result :
I. J. SCHOENBERG
3. The function
exp [- | x\p]
is positive definite if 0 <p ^ 2 and not positive definite if p>2.
First proof. We know that exp [ — x2] is p.d. from the formula just preceding (4) and property
I. Hence exp [ — |x|2y], (0<7<1),
is p.d. by Corollary
2, as <p(x) = | x\2 is homogeneous,
and the first part of the statement
is proved.
Suppose now that (19) werep.d.
for a value p>2.
By Theorem
2 this would
imply that the space Ei(p/2),
which is the real axis with the metric | x — x' \ p/2,
were imbeddable
in §. But this is clearly impossible as Ex(p/2) is not even a
metric space since the distances among the points x = 0, 1, 2 are 01 = 1,12 = 1,
02 =2p/2>2, and they violate the triangle inequality.
Second direct proof for the case 0 <p ^2. First we shall prove directly on
the basis of properties
II and III
the function f(x) defined by
(16) and (15) is p.d. By property HI (7—>°o) it suffices to show that
C T sin2 xu
is p.d. By the definition of the Stieltjes integral,
this is a limit of functions
of the form
exp — 23 2-4,. sin2 xu, ,
and it suffices to show that each of the factors is p.d. Now
exp [— 2A sin2 xu]=
exp [— A] exp [A cos 2xw],
and this is p.d. because cos 2xm is p.d. and the exponential
series has positive coefficients only. This point being disposed of, it suffices to show that | x \ p,
is of the form (14).* This is apparent
on account of the formula
\p = I sin2 xu-u~1~pdu / I sisin2 m • u 1~pdu,
valid for 0<p<2,
which is as easily established
as the similar representation (8). An obvious step-function
for <j(u) in (14), with only one jump at the
origin, settles the case p = 2.
6. On the imbedding of the spaces Emp, lv, L", (0 <p ^ 2), in § by a change
of metric. We learned in §2 that e~'2 is p.d. in £j or L2. We shall now show
* It is not by accident that the function (19) is of the form (16) if 0<p¿2.
For if (19) is p.d.,
its positive powers must also be p.d., and the function is necessarily of the form (16), by Theorem 3.
Notice that it is not bounded away from zero and hence is not of the form (17).
METRIC SPACES
that e_|i|P is p.d. in the spaces Emp, lp, and Lp for values of p in the range
The function exp [— |x| p] was found to be p.d. if 0<p^2.
functions exp [— |x,| p], (¿ = 1, 2, • ■ • , m), are also p.d. when regarded
functions of the m variables x¿, and we may infer, by property
II (§2), that
their product
■ ■ ■ + | xm|*>)],
0 < p ^ 2,
is p.d. But this is equivalent
to the statement
that exp [— \t\ p] is p.d. in
En?. As the similar statement
for lp is proved in the same way as for 7>, only
requiring less care, we shall limit ourselves to the consideration
of 7>. Let
Pi = Xi(t),
f \xi(t)\pdt,
¿= 1,2, ••• ,«,
exists, be « points of l?. For
~PlFk = ( J | Xi(t) - xk(t) \pdt\
we have to show that
X) PiPk exp [- PiPk ] ^ 0
for real p¿. There is no loss of generality
in assuming that the functions x,(/)
are continuous,
as continuous
functions are everywhere
dense in Lp. For
x„i = m~llp- Xi(v/m), v = 1, 2, • • • , m; i = 1, 2, • ■ • , n,
( SI x„¿ - Xyk |p ) = ( — ZZ\ Xi(v/m) - xk(v/m) \ " )
which proves the inequality
(20), for (20) is already known to hold for all
values of m if the PiPk of (20) are replaced by the quantities
on the left-hand
side of (21).
The fact that exp [- |/| "], (0<p^2),
is p.d. in Emp, l", Lp implies that
exp [— \t\2], and therefore
also exp [— X|<|2], (X>0),
is p.d. in Emp(p/2),
and Lp(p/2).
We have thus proved the following theorem:
I. J. SCHOENBERG
5. The spaces Emv, l", and L",(0<p^2),
becomeimbeddable in §
if we raise their metrics to the power p/2 or less. In other words, Emp (7), l"(y),
and L"(y) are imbeddable in ¡Qfor values of y in the range 0 <y^p/2*
Note that for p = 2 this result coincides with Corollary 1.
The fact that Emp, (0<p<l),
which is not a metric space, may be made
metric by raising its metric to a suitable power was already known in a different terminology.
Indeed, the following readily established
"substitute"
Minkowski's inequality ( , p. 32)
231 Xi + yi\p á 231 Xi\p + 231 y*\p, o < p < 1,
means precisely
Emp(p), and therefore
Emp(y), (0<y^p),
is a metric
space. Now Theorem 5 states that if we restrict this range of 7 to 0 <y ^ p/2,
then not only can any three points of Emp (7) be imbedded
isometrically
euclidean space, but the same is true for any number of such points, since the
whole space is imbeddable in Hubert space.
7. Some unsolved problems. We shall devote this last section to a few unsolved analytical problems and to a brief discussion of their geometrical
implications.
1. Let p be a real number exceeding 2, and let m = 2, 3, ■ • • . Do
there exist positive exponents k such that the function
is positive definite?
If there are such positive exponents, then Corollary 2 implies the existence
of a positive number Km with the properties
: (22) is p.d. if 0 < k ^ nm and is not
p.d. if K>Km. Furthermore
3 implies that pKm^2 or Km^2/p.
Theorem 2 furnishes the following geometrical equivalent to Problem 1. The function (22) is p.d. if and only if Emp(pK/2), and therefore also lp(pK./2) and
Lp(pK¡2), are imbeddable in §.
Particularly
interesting
is the next problem concerning the limiting case
* The following is a different phrasing of the fact that LPipJl) is imbeddable in L2: IfO<p<2,
then there is a functional y(t) = U[x(t)], defined for all functions x(t) in L", with values y(t) in L2 such
that the relation
\"dt= f I yi(t) - y2(/) \Ht
holds for two arbitrary X\{(), x^{t) of L?. This functional y = U[x\ is necessarily continuous and univalent. A study of its further properties might prove to be of interest in the theory of L".

2. Do there exist positive exponents y such that the function
[max (| Xi\, ■ ■ ■ , \ xm\ )H
= min (eH*!",
. . . , e-l*».l'*)
is positive definite ?
Again, if such exponents
exist, there would exist a positive number ym
with the properties: (23) is p.d. if 0<7^7„,
and is not p.d. if 7>7™. Moreover the function
(23) is p.d. if and only if En?(y) is imbeddable
The particular
of this second problem
is due to the following
lemma which is due essentially to Fréchet
( , pp. 161-162). Let us call a
finite metric set and denote by am a metric space composed of exactly m+1 distinct points.
Lemma. Any finite metric set <rm of m+1 points may be imbedded isometrically in E„f.
Proof. Let P0, Pi, ■ ■ ■ , Pm denote the points of am and PiPk their distances. Consider in 7%,°° the following m + \ points:
Qi = (xu, X2i, ■ ■ ■ , xmi) = (Fi-Pi, P2F„ • • • , PmPi),
i = 0, 1, • • • , m.
For their distance QiQk in 7¿m°°
Q,Qk= max | x,-,- — xjk\= max | P,Pi — P,Pk | = PiPk,
3=1, • • • , m
1=1, • • • , m
for certainly
\PjPi—PjPk\
—PiPk, (f = \, ■ ■ ■ , m), on account
of the triangle inequality
in erm, while the equality
sign holds if j is equal to whichever
of the numbers i or k happens to be different from zero and hence within the
range oij. If both i = k = Q, the result QoQo = 0 was clear from the start.
On the basis of this lemma it is natural to classify finite metric sets according to their "dimension"
as follows: A set c„ ¿5 said to be of dimension m
(always less than or equal to «, on account of the lemma) if it is imbeddable in
Em, but not in Em-i. If the last requirement is removed, the dimension of cr„ does
not exceed m.
If Problem 2 were solved in the affirmative,
we would get the following
statement : If <xn is any finite metric set of dimension less than or equal to m,
then <rn(y) is imbeddable
in En if 0 <y = ym, and ym is the best constant.
This would generalize in a certain sense the following theorem
L. M. Blumenthal
( , p. 402): If o-3 is a finite metric set composed of four
points, then 0-3(7) & imbeddable in E3 if 0 <y ^ 1/2, and 1/2 is the best constant.
In conclusion let us point out the following perhaps not trivial remark
concerning Problem
2: y2 exists and is greater than or equal to 1/2. Indeed,
in view of the formula
I. J. SCHOENBERG
we get by the transformation
of variables
u = (^+r¡)/2,
z» = (£ — v)/2 in the
double integral
r°° r dudv
I exp ¿(xm + yv)-—-
J [l + (« + v)2][l + (u - v)2]
™ — I exP K(* + y)/2] ———• I exp [n,(x - y)/2\ ——-
1 + ¿2 •/_*,
= — exp [-
§| x + y | — h\ x — y\ J = — exp [- max (| x|,|
due to the relation 2 max (|x|,
\y\) = \x+y\
+\x — y\. This formula shows
that the function
(23) is p.d. if m = 2, 7 = 1/2. Hence this much is proved:
If o-n is any finite metric set of dimension
not exceeding 2, then crn(y),
(0 <7 á 1/2), is imbeddable in E„.
If 73 exists, then it is certainly less than or equal to 1/2, by Blumenthal 's
and is probably
even less than 1/2. A certain special set o-4 shows
that if 74 exists, it must be less than 0.45.
