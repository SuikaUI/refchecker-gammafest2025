Virtual-Move Parallel Tempering
Ivan Coluzza* and Daan Frenkel[a]
The exponential increase in the speed of computers during the
past few decades has made it possible to perform simulations
that were utterly unfeasible one generation ago. But in many
cases, the development of more efficient algorithms has been
at least as important.
One of the most widely used schemes to simulate manybody
Markov-chain
Monte Carlo
(MCMC) that was introduced in 1953 by Metropolis et al. In
this algorithm the average properties of a system are estimated by performing a random walk in the configurational space,
where each state is sampled with a frequency proportional to
its Boltzmann weight. In the Metropolis algorithm, this is achieved by attempting random moves from the current state of
the system to a new state. Depending on the ratio of the
Boltzmann weights of the new and old states, these trial
moves may be either accepted or rejected. Metropolis et al.

showed that the acceptance probability of trial moves can be
chosen such that Boltzmann sampling is achieved.
One important application of the MCMC method is the estimation of the Landau free energy F of the system given in
Equation (1) as function of some order parameter:
FðQÞ ¼ kT½lnPðQÞ
There are many situations where the MCMC method does not
yield an accurate estimate of F, because it fails to explore configuration space efficiently. This is, for instance, the case in
“glassy” systems that tend to get trapped for long times in
small pockets of configuration space. In the early 1990s the socalled parallel-tempering (PT) technique was introduced to
speed up the sampling in such systems. 
In a parallel-tempering Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, n simulations of a particular model system are carried out in parallel
at different temperatures (or at different values of some other
thermodynamic field, such as the chemical potential or a biasing potential). Each of these copies of the system is called a
replica. In addition to the regular MC trial moves, one occasionally attempts to swap the temperatures of a pair of these
systems (say i and j). The swapping move between temperatures i and j is accepted or rejected according to a criterion
that guarantees detailed balance, for example, see Equation (2):
PaccðijÞ ¼
1 þ eDbijDEij
where Dbij is the difference of the inverse of swapping temperatures, and DEij is the energy difference of the two configurations. Although there are other valid acceptance rules, we
used the one in Equation (2) because it was easy to implement.
To facilitate the sampling of high free-energy states (“difficult” regions), we used adaptive umbrella sampling. In this
(iterative) scheme, a biasing potential is constructed using the
histogram of the states, sampled during an iteration as follows
in Equation (3):
WIðQ,TÞ ¼ WI1ðQ,TÞa ln½PIðQÞ
where W is the biasing potential function of an order parameter Q, I is the iteration number, a is a constant that controls
the rate of convergence of W (a typical value for a is 0.05), and
T is the temperature. After iteration, W converges to the
Landau free energy. As a consequence, P(Q)~exp[bF(q)]exp-
[W(Q)] becomes essentially flat and the biased sampling explores a larger fraction of the configuration space. During the
MC sampling we include the bias, and only at the end of the
simulation do we compute the free energy F(Q) from Equation (4):
FðQÞ ¼ kT½lnPðQÞ þ WðQ,TÞ
where P(Q) is the probability of observing a state characterized
by the order parameter Q, and W(Q,T) is the biasing potential
of the last iteration computed at temperature T. Combined
with parallel tempering, the acceptance rule for the temperature swapping move is then described by Equations (5) and
eDbijDEijþDWij
1 þ eDbijDEijþDWij
DWij ¼ WIðQi,TjÞWIðQj,TjÞ þ WIðQj,TiÞWIðQi,TiÞ
where i and j are replica indices, and I is the iteration number.
We refer to this scheme as APT (adaptive parallel tempering). 
In the conventional MCMC method all information about rejected trial moves is discarded. Recently one of us proposed a
scheme that makes it possible to include the contributions of
rejected configurations in the sampling of averages. Herein,
we show how this approach can be used to increase the
power of the parallel-tempering scheme.
In this scheme, we only retain information about PT moves
that have been accepted. However, in the spirit of ref. , we
can include the contribution of all PT trial moves, irrespective
of whether they are accepted. The weight of the contribution
of such a virtual move is directly related to its acceptance
probability. For instance, if we use the symmetric acceptance
rule for MC trial moves, then the weights of the original and
new (trial) state in the sampling of virtual moves are given by
Equations (7) and (8):
eDbDEO!NþDWO!N
1 þ eDbDEO!NþDWO!N
1 þ eDbDEO!NþDWO!N
where DWO!N is defined in Equation (6). We are not limited to
a single trial swap of state i with a given state j. Rather, we can
include all possible trial swaps between the temperature
state i and all N1 remaining temperatures. Our estimate for
the contribution to the probability distribution Pi corresponding to temperature i is then given by the following sum in
Equation (8)
1 þ eDbijDEijþDWij
eDbijDEijþDWij
1 þ eDbijDEijþDWij
where the delta functions select the configurations with order
parameter Q. As we now combine the parallel-tempering algorithm with a set of parallel virtual moves, we refer to the present scheme as virtual-move parallel tempering (VMPT).
To measure the efficiency of VMPT, we computed the freeenergy landscape of a simple lattice-protein model. In this
model, interaction with a substrate can induce a conformation-

al change in the proteins. For the same system we had already
explored the use of the conventional APT scheme. 
Specifically, the model protein that we consider represents a
heteropolymer containing 80 amino acids, while the substrate
has a fixed-space arrangement and contains 40 residues (see
Figure 1). The configurational energy of the system is defined
as Equation (10):
EC ¼ Eintra þ Einter ¼
where the indices i and j run over the residues of the protein,
while j’ runs only over the elements of the substrate; C is the
contact defined as Equation (11):
if i neighbor of j
and Sij is the interaction matrix.
For S we use the 20G20 matrix
fitted by Miyazawa and Jernigan on the basis of the frequency
We change the identity of the
amino acids along the chain by
“point mutations” which, in this
context, means changes of a
single amino acid. In doing so
we explore the sequence space
of the protein and the substrate,
and we minimize at the same
time the configurational energy
of the system in two distinct
configurations, one bound (Figure 1a) and one unbound (Figure 1b). The design scheme is
ref. . In this scheme, trial mutations are accepted if the Monte Carlo acceptance criterion is
satisfied for both configurations.
The result of the design process is a model protein that has
the ability to change its conformation when bound to the substrate. The sampling of the configurations
three basic moves: corner-flip,
crankshaft, and branch rotation.
The corner-flip involves a rotation of 1808 of a given particle
around the line joining its neighbors along the chain. The crankshaft move is a rotation by 908
of two consecutive particles. A

we used the same parameters for both algorithms. The results in Figure 2 show that VMPT was much more efficient in sampling the free energy. In simulation II, we increased by two orders of magnitude the number of
steps of the simulation with APT to obtain a sampling of comparable F(Q) to the one computed using the new
VMPT scheme (Figure 4). Execution times computed on an SGI Altix 3700 with Intel Itanium II, 1.3 GHz

branch rotation is a turn, around
a randomly chosen pivot particle, of the whole section starting
going to the end of the chain.
For all these moves we use a
acceptance
[Eq. (12)] with the addition of
the biasing potential calculated

1 þ ebDEO!NþDWO!N
where DEO!N is the energy difference between the new and
[Eq. (10)],
DWO!N is the difference in the
bias potential from the same
states [Eq. (3)]. We sample the
free energy as a function of two
order parameters, of which the

between the number of contacts

are the contact maps of the reference structures, and Cij is the contact map
of the instantaneous configuration. The order parameter that

and every contact that belongs
to structure 2 has a value 1.
Contacts that appear in both 1
and 2, or do not appear in
either, do not contribute to the
order parameter.
The reason why we assign
negative values to native contacts of structure 2 is that we
compute the free-energy difference between the protein in
configurations 1 and 2. If we had assigned 0 to the contacts of
structure 2 then we would not have been able to distinguish it
from unfolded configurations that do not have any native contacts at all. For our specific case, Cð1Þ
represents the structure
in Figure 1a, while Cð2Þ
corresponds to the one shown in Figure 1b, and Q has values between 15 and 30. Because the

(b). The free energies F(EC,Q) are a function of the conformational energy EC [Eq. (10)] and of the number of native
contacts Q [Eq. (13)]. It is important to notice the big difference in the sampling; in fact, the number of points
sampled with VMPT is 30 times larger than that with APT.

number of native contacts includes the contacts with the substrate of the reference state, it can be used to compute the
free-energy difference between the unbound state and the
specifically bound one.
We performed 15 simulations, five of them with VMPT
(using the parameters in Table 1 I) and the other ten with APT
(five using the parameters in Table 1 I, and five with the parameters in Table 1 II). In Figure 2 we compare the average free energies at T=0.1 (with error bars). We only show those free energies that were sampled in all five simulations of each group.
It is clear that the VMPT approach leads to a much better sampling of the free-energy landscape. The advantage of the
VMPT approach becomes even more obvious if we plot the
free-energy “landscape” as function of two order parameters
(viz. the conformational energy [Eq. (10)] and the number of
native contacts). In this case the APT method is almost useless,
as only small fragments of the free-energy landscape can be
reconstructed. The total number of points sampled with VMPT
is 20 times larger than that with APT, and the energy range
probed is one order of magnitude larger (see Figure 3).
To check the accuracy of the VMPT method, we compared
the average free energy obtained by APT and VMPT at high
temperatures where the APT scheme works reasonably well. As
can be seen in Figure 4 the two methods agree well in this
regime, although a much longer APT simulation was needed.
Even though the APT runs required 20 times more MC cycles,
the method still probes about 30% less of the free-energy
landscape than the VMPT scheme.
As the implementation described above is not based on a
particular feature of the system under study, the results obtained suggest that the VMPT method may be useful for the
study of any system that is normally simulated using parallel
tempering. Examples of the application of parallel tempering
in fully atomistic simulations of protein folding can be found
in refs. .
