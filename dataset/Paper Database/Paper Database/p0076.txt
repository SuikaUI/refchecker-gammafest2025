Synthesizing high-quality images from text descriptions
is a challenging problem in computer vision and has many
practical applications. Samples generated by existing textto-image approaches can roughly reﬂect the meaning of the
given descriptions, but they fail to contain necessary details
and vivid object parts. In this paper, we propose Stacked
Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) to generate
256×256 photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions. We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems through a sketch-reﬁnement process.
The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors
of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes
Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. It
is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and add compelling details with the reﬁnement process. To improve the
diversity of the synthesized images and stabilize the training
of the conditional-GAN, we introduce a novel Conditioning
Augmentation technique that encourages smoothness in the
latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and
comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves signiﬁcant
improvements on generating photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions.
1. Introduction
Generating photo-realistic images from text is an important problem and has tremendous applications, including photo-editing, computer-aided design, etc. Recently,
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have
shown promising results in synthesizing real-world images. Conditioned on given text descriptions, conditional-

Comparison of the proposed StackGAN and a vanilla
one-stage GAN for generating 256×256 images. (a) Given text
descriptions, Stage-I of StackGAN sketches rough shapes and basic colors of objects, yielding low-resolution images. (b) Stage-II
of StackGAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs,
and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details.
(c) Results by a vanilla 256×256 GAN which simply adds more
upsampling layers to state-of-the-art GAN-INT-CLS . It is unable to generate any plausible images of 256×256 resolution.
GANs are able to generate images that are highly
related to the text meanings.
However, it is very difﬁcult to train GAN to generate
high-resolution photo-realistic images from text descriptions. Simply adding more upsampling layers in state-ofthe-art GAN models for generating high-resolution (e.g.,
256×256) images generally results in training instability
 
and produces nonsensical outputs (see Figure 1(c)). The
main difﬁculty for generating high-resolution images by
GANs is that supports of natural image distribution and implied model distribution may not overlap in high dimensional pixel space . This problem is more severe
as the image resolution increases. Reed et al. only succeeded in generating plausible 64×64 images conditioned
on text descriptions , which usually lack details and
vivid object parts, e.g., beaks and eyes of birds.
Moreover, they were unable to synthesize higher resolution (e.g.,
128×128) images without providing additional annotations
of objects .
In analogy to how human painters draw, we decompose
the problem of text to photo-realistic image synthesis into
two more tractable sub-problems with Stacked Generative
Adversarial Networks (StackGAN). Low-resolution images
are ﬁrst generated by our Stage-I GAN (see Figure 1(a)). On
the top of our Stage-I GAN, we stack Stage-II GAN to generate realistic high-resolution (e.g., 256×256) images conditioned on Stage-I results and text descriptions (see Figure 1(b)). By conditioning on the Stage-I result and the
text again, Stage-II GAN learns to capture the text information that is omitted by Stage-I GAN and draws more details for the object. The support of model distribution generated from a roughly aligned low-resolution image has better
probability of intersecting with the support of image distribution. This is the underlying reason why Stage-II GAN is
able to generate better high-resolution images.
In addition, for the text-to-image generation task, the
limited number of training text-image pairs often results in
sparsity in the text conditioning manifold and such sparsity makes it difﬁcult to train GAN. Thus, we propose a
novel Conditioning Augmentation technique to encourage
smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. It allows
small random perturbations in the conditioning manifold
and increases the diversity of synthesized images.
The contribution of the proposed method is threefold:
(1) We propose a novel Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks for synthesizing photo-realistic images from
text descriptions.
It decomposes the difﬁcult problem
of generating high-resolution images into more manageable subproblems and signiﬁcantly improve the state of
The StackGAN for the ﬁrst time generates images of 256×256 resolution with photo-realistic details
from text descriptions. (2) A new Conditioning Augmentation technique is proposed to stabilize the conditional
GAN training and also improves the diversity of the generated samples. (3) Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall
model design as well as the effects of individual components, which provide useful information for designing future conditional GAN models.

2. Related Work
Generative image modeling is a fundamental problem in
computer vision. There has been remarkable progress in
this direction with the emergence of deep learning techniques.
Variational Autoencoders (VAE) formulated the problem with probabilistic graphical models
whose goal was to maximize the lower bound of data likelihood. Autoregressive models (e.g., PixelRNN) that
utilized neural networks to model the conditional distribution of the pixel space have also generated appealing
synthetic images.
Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown promising performance for
generating sharper images. But training instability makes
it hard for GAN models to generate high-resolution (e.g.,
256×256) images. Several techniques 
have been proposed to stabilize the training process and
generate compelling results. An energy-based GAN 
has also been proposed for more stable training behavior.
Built upon these generative models, conditional image
generation has also been studied. Most methods utilized
simple conditioning variables such as attributes or class labels . There is also work conditioned on images to generate images, including photo editing , domain transfer and super-resolution . However, super-resolution methods can only add limited
details to low-resolution images and can not correct large
defects as our proposed StackGAN does. Recently, several
methods have been developed to generate images from unstructured text. Mansimov et al. built an AlignDRAW
model by learning to estimate alignment between text and
the generating canvas. Reed et al. used conditional PixelCNN to generate images using the text descriptions and
object location constraints. Nguyen et al. used an approximate Langevin sampling approach to generate images
conditioned on text. However, their sampling approach requires an inefﬁcient iterative optimization process. With
conditional GAN, Reed et al. successfully generated
plausible 64×64 images for birds and ﬂowers based on text
descriptions. Their follow-up work was able to generate 128×128 images by utilizing additional annotations on
object part locations.
Besides using a single GAN for generating images, there
is also work that utilized a series of GANs for image generation. Wang et al. factorized the indoor scene
generation process into structure generation and style generation with the proposed S2-GAN. In contrast, the second
stage of our StackGAN aims to complete object details and
correct defects of Stage-I results based on text descriptions.
Denton et al. built a series of GANs within a Laplacian pyramid framework. At each level of the pyramid, a
residual image was generated conditioned on the image of
the previous stage and then added back to the input image
to produce the input for the next stage. Concurrent to our
work, Huang et al. also showed that they can generate
better images by stacking several GANs to reconstruct the
multi-level representations of a pre-trained discriminative
model. However, they only succeeded in generating 32×32
images, while our method utilizes a simpler architecture to
generate 256×256 images with photo-realistic details and
sixty-four times more pixels.
3. Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks
To generate high-resolution images with photo-realistic
details, we propose a simple yet effective Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks. It decomposes the text-to-image
generative process into two stages (see Figure 2).
- Stage-I GAN: it sketches the primitive shape and basic colors of the object conditioned on the given text
description, and draws the background layout from a
random noise vector, yielding a low-resolution image.
- Stage-II GAN: it corrects defects in the low-resolution
image from Stage-I and completes details of the object
by reading the text description again, producing a highresolution photo-realistic image.
3.1. Preliminaries
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are composed of two models that are alternatively trained to compete with each other. The generator G is optimized to reproduce the true data distribution pdata by generating images that are difﬁcult for the discriminator D to differentiate
from real images. Meanwhile, D is optimized to distinguish
real images and synthetic images generated by G. Overall,
the training procedure is similar to a two-player min-max
game with the following objective function,
D V (D, G) = Ex∼pdata[log D(x)] +
Ez∼pz[log(1 −D(G(z)))],
where x is a real image from the true data distribution pdata,
and z is a noise vector sampled from distribution pz (e.g.,
uniform or Gaussian distribution).
Conditional GAN is an extension of GAN where
both the generator and discriminator receive additional conditioning variables c, yielding G(z, c) and D(x, c). This
formulation allows G to generate images conditioned on
variables c.
3.2. Conditioning Augmentation
As shown in Figure 2, the text description t is ﬁrst encoded by an encoder, yielding a text embedding ϕt.
previous works , the text embedding is nonlinearly
transformed to generate conditioning latent variables as the
input of the generator. However, latent space for the text
embedding is usually high dimensional (> 100 dimensions). With limited amount of data, it usually causes discontinuity in the latent data manifold, which is not desirable
for learning the generator. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce a Conditioning Augmentation technique to produce additional conditioning variables ˆc. In contrast to the
ﬁxed conditioning text variable c in , we randomly
sample the latent variables ˆc from an independent Gaussian
distribution N(µ(ϕt), Σ(ϕt)), where the mean µ(ϕt) and
diagonal covariance matrix Σ(ϕt) are functions of the text
embedding ϕt. The proposed Conditioning Augmentation
yields more training pairs given a small number of imagetext pairs, and thus encourages robustness to small perturbations along the conditioning manifold. To further enforce
the smoothness over the conditioning manifold and avoid
overﬁtting , we add the following regularization term
to the objective of the generator during training,
DKL(N(µ(ϕt), Σ(ϕt)) || N(0, I)),
which is the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence)
between the standard Gaussian distribution and the conditioning Gaussian distribution. The randomness introduced
in the Conditioning Augmentation is beneﬁcial for modeling text to image translation as the same sentence usually
corresponds to objects with various poses and appearances.
3.3. Stage-I GAN
Instead of directly generating a high-resolution image
conditioned on the text description, we simplify the task to
ﬁrst generate a low-resolution image with our Stage-I GAN,
which focuses on drawing only rough shape and correct colors for the object.
Let ϕt be the text embedding of the given description,
which is generated by a pre-trained encoder in this paper. The Gaussian conditioning variables ˆc0 for text embedding are sampled from N(µ0(ϕt), Σ0(ϕt)) to capture the
meaning of ϕt with variations. Conditioned on ˆc0 and random variable z, Stage-I GAN trains the discriminator D0
and the generator G0 by alternatively maximizing LD0 in
Eq. (3) and minimizing LG0 in Eq. (4),
LD0 = E(I0,t)∼pdata[log D0(I0, ϕt)] +
Ez∼pz,t∼pdata[log(1 −D0(G0(z, ˆc0), ϕt))],
LG0 = Ez∼pz,t∼pdata[log(1 −D0(G0(z, ˆc0), ϕt))] +
λDKL(N(µ0(ϕt), Σ0(ϕt)) || N(0, I)),
where the real image I0 and the text description t are from
the true data distribution pdata. z is a noise vector randomly
sampled from a given distribution pz (Gaussian distribution
in this paper). λ is a regularization parameter that balances
the two terms in Eq. (4). We set λ = 1 for all our experiments. Using the reparameterization trick introduced
in , both µ0(ϕt) and Σ0(ϕt) are learned jointly with the
rest of the network.

fed into a fully connected layer to generate µ0 and σ0 (σ0
are the values in the diagonal of Σ0) for the Gaussian distribution N(µ0(ϕt), Σ0(ϕt)). ˆc0 are then sampled from the
Gaussian distribution. Our Ng dimensional conditioning
vector ˆc0 is computed by ˆc0 = µ0 + σ0 ⊙ϵ (where ⊙is
the element-wise multiplication, ϵ ∼N(0, I)). Then, ˆc0 is
concatenated with a Nz dimensional noise vector to generate a W0 × H0 image by a series of up-sampling blocks.
For the discriminator D0, the text embedding ϕt is ﬁrst
compressed to Nd dimensions using a fully-connected layer
and then spatially replicated to form a Md × Md × Nd
tensor. Meanwhile, the image is fed through a series of
down-sampling blocks until it has Md × Md spatial dimension. Then, the image ﬁlter map is concatenated along the
channel dimension with the text tensor. The resulting tensor is further fed to a 1×1 convolutional layer to jointly
learn features across the image and the text. Finally, a fullyconnected layer with one node is used to produce the decision score.
3.4. Stage-II GAN
Low-resolution images generated by Stage-I GAN usually lack vivid object parts and might contain shape distortions. Some details in the text might also be omitted in the
ﬁrst stage, which is vital for generating photo-realistic images. Our Stage-II GAN is built upon Stage-I GAN results
to generate high-resolution images.
It is conditioned on
low-resolution images and also the text embedding again to
correct defects in Stage-I results. The Stage-II GAN completes previously ignored text information to generate more
photo-realistic details.
Conditioning on the low-resolution result s0
G0(z, ˆc0) and Gaussian latent variables ˆc, the discriminator
D and generator G in Stage-II GAN are trained by alternatively maximizing LD in Eq. (5) and minimizing LG in
LD = E(I,t)∼pdata[log D(I, ϕt)] +
Es0∼pG0,t∼pdata[log(1 −D(G(s0, ˆc), ϕt))],
LG = Es0∼pG0,t∼pdata[log(1 −D(G(s0, ˆc), ϕt))] +
λDKL(N(µ(ϕt), Σ(ϕt)) || N(0, I)),
Different from the original GAN formulation, the random
noise z is not used in this stage with the assumption that
the randomness has already been preserved by s0. Gaussian conditioning variables ˆc used in this stage and ˆc0 used
in Stage-I GAN share the same pre-trained text encoder,
generating the same text embedding ϕt. However, Stage-
I and Stage-II Conditioning Augmentation have different
fully connected layers for generating different means and
standard deviations. In this way, Stage-II GAN learns to
capture useful information in the text embedding that is
omitted by Stage-I GAN.
Model Architecture.
We design Stage-II generator as
an encoder-decoder network with residual blocks . Similar to the previous stage, the text embedding ϕt is used
to generate the Ng dimensional text conditioning vector ˆc,
which is spatially replicated to form a Mg×Mg×Ng tensor.
Meanwhile, the Stage-I result s0 generated by Stage-I GAN
is fed into several down-sampling blocks (i.e., encoder) until it has a spatial size of Mg × Mg. The image features
and the text features are concatenated along the channel dimension. The encoded image features coupled with text
features are fed into several residual blocks, which are designed to learn multi-modal representations across image
and text features. Finally, a series of up-sampling layers
(i.e., decoder) are used to generate a W ×H high-resolution
image. Such a generator is able to help rectify defects in the
input image while add more details to generate the realistic
high-resolution image.
For the discriminator, its structure is similar to that of
Stage-I discriminator with only extra down-sampling blocks
since the image size is larger in this stage. To explicitly enforce GAN to learn better alignment between the image and
the conditioning text, rather than using the vanilla discriminator, we adopt the matching-aware discriminator proposed
by Reed et al. for both stages. During training, the
discriminator takes real images and their corresponding text
descriptions as positive sample pairs, whereas negative sample pairs consist of two groups. The ﬁrst is real images with
mismatched text embeddings, while the second is synthetic
images with their corresponding text embeddings.
3.5. Implementation details
The up-sampling blocks consist of the nearest-neighbor
upsampling followed by a 3×3 stride 1 convolution. Batch
normalization and ReLU activation are applied after
every convolution except the last one. The residual blocks
consist of 3×3 stride 1 convolutions, Batch normalization
and ReLU. Two residual blocks are used in 128×128 Stack-
GAN models while four are used in 256×256 models. The
down-sampling blocks consist of 4×4 stride 2 convolutions,
Batch normalization and LeakyReLU, except that the ﬁrst
one does not have Batch normalization.
By default, Ng = 128, Nz = 100, Mg = 16, Md = 4,
Nd = 128, W0 = H0 = 64 and W = H = 256. For training, we ﬁrst iteratively train D0 and G0 of Stage-I GAN
for 600 epochs by ﬁxing Stage-II GAN. Then we iteratively
train D and G of Stage-II GAN for another 600 epochs by
ﬁxing Stage-I GAN. All networks are trained using ADAM
solver with batch size 64 and an initial learning rate of
0.0002. The learning rate is decayed to 1/2 of its previous
value every 100 epochs.
4. Experiments
To validate our method, we conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Two state-of-the-art methods on text-to-image synthesis, GAN-INT-CLS and
GAWWN , are compared. Results by the two compared
methods are generated using the code released by their authors. In addition, we design several baseline models to
investigate the overall design and important components of
our proposed StackGAN. For the ﬁrst baseline, we directly
train Stage-I GAN for generating 64×64 and 256×256 images to investigate whether the proposed stacked structure
and Conditioning Augmentation are beneﬁcial. Then we
modify our StackGAN to generate 128×128 and 256×256
images to investigate whether larger images by our method
result in higher image quality. We also investigate whether
inputting text at both stages of StackGAN is useful.
4.1. Datasets and evaluation metrics
CUB contains 200 bird species with 11,788 images.
Since 80% of birds in this dataset have object-image size
ratios of less than 0.5 , as a pre-processing step, we
crop all images to ensure that bounding boxes of birds have
greater-than-0.75 object-image size ratios. Oxford-102 
contains 8,189 images of ﬂowers from 102 different categories. To show the generalization capability of our approach, a more challenging dataset, MS COCO is also
utilized for evaluation. Different from CUB and Oxford-
102, the MS COCO dataset contains images with multiple
objects and various backgrounds. It has a training set with
80k images and a validation set with 40k images. Each
image in COCO has 5 descriptions, while 10 descriptions
are provided by for every image in CUB and Oxford-
102 datasets.
Following the experimental setup in ,
we directly use the training and validation sets provided
by COCO, meanwhile we split CUB and Oxford-102 into
class-disjoint training and test sets.
Evaluation metrics.
It is difﬁcult to evaluate the performance of generative models (e.g., GAN). We choose a
recently proposed numerical assessment approach “inception score” for quantitative evaluation,
I = exp(ExDKL(p(y|x) || p(y))),
where x denotes one generated sample, and y is the label
predicted by the Inception model . The intuition behind
this metric is that good models should generate diverse but
meaningful images. Therefore, the KL divergence between
the marginal distribution p(y) and the conditional distribution p(y|x) should be large. In our experiments, we directly
use the pre-trained Inception model for COCO dataset. For
ﬁne-grained datasets, CUB and Oxford-102, we ﬁne-tune
an Inception model for each of them. As suggested in ,
we evaluate this metric on a large number of samples (i.e.,
30k randomly selected samples) for each model.
Although the inception score has shown to well correlate
with human perception on visual quality of samples , it
cannot reﬂect whether the generated images are well conditioned on the given text descriptions. Therefore, we also
conduct human evaluation. We randomly select 50 text descriptions for each class of CUB and Oxford-102 test sets.
For COCO dataset, 4k text descriptions are randomly selected from its validation set.
For each sentence, 5 images are generated by each model. Given the same text descriptions, 10 users (not including any of the authors) are
asked to rank the results by different methods. The average
ranks by human users are calculated to evaluate all compared methods.

for our proposed StackGAN and compared methods are reported in Table 1. Representative examples are compared in
Figure 3 and Figure 4.
Our StackGAN achieves the best inception score and average human rank on all three datasets.
Compared with
GAN-INT-CLS , StackGAN achieves 28.47% improvement in terms of inception score on CUB dataset (from 2.88

GAN also indicates our proposed method is able to generate
more realistic samples conditioned on text descriptions.
As shown in Figure 3, the 64×64 samples generated by
GAN-INT-CLS can only reﬂect the general shape and
color of the birds. Their results lack vivid parts (e.g., beak
and legs) and convincing details in most cases, which make
them neither realistic enough nor have sufﬁciently high resolution. By using additional conditioning variables on loca-

tion constraints, GAWWN obtains a better inception
score on CUB dataset, which is still slightly lower than
ours. It generates higher resolution images with more details than GAN-INT-CLS, as shown in Figure 3. However,
as mentioned by its authors, GAWWN fails to generate any
plausible images when it is only conditioned on text descriptions . In comparison, our StackGAN can generate 256×256 photo-realistic images from only text descriptions.
Figure 5 illustrates some examples of the Stage-I and
Stage-II images generated by our StackGAN. As shown
in the ﬁrst row of Figure 5, in most cases, Stage-I GAN
is able to draw rough shapes and colors of objects given
text descriptions.
However, Stage-I images are usually
blurry with various defects and missing details, especially
for foreground objects. As shown in the second row, Stage-
II GAN generates 4× higher resolution images with more
convincing details to better reﬂect corresponding text descriptions.
For cases where Stage-I GAN has generated
plausible shapes and colors, Stage-II GAN completes the
details. For instance, in the 1st column of Figure 5, with a
satisfactory Stage-I result, Stage-II GAN focuses on drawing the short beak and white color described in the text as
well as details for the tail and legs. In all other examples,
different degrees of details are added to Stage-II images. In
many other cases, Stage-II GAN is able to correct the defects of Stage-I results by processing the text description
again. For example, while the Stage-I image in the 5th column has a blue crown rather than the reddish brown crown
described in the text, the defect is corrected by Stage-II
GAN. In some extreme cases (e.g., the 7th column of Figure 5), even when Stage-I GAN fails to draw a plausible
shape, Stage-II GAN is able to generate reasonable objects.
We also observe that StackGAN has the ability to transfer
background from Stage-I images and ﬁne-tune them to be
more realistic with higher resolution at Stage-II.
Importantly, the StackGAN does not achieve good results by simply memorizing training samples but by capturing the complex underlying language-image relations.
We extract visual features from our generated images and
all training images by the Stage-II discriminator D of our
StackGAN. For each generated image, its nearest neighbors
from the training set can be retrieved. By visually inspecting the retrieved images (see Figure 6), we can conclude
that the generated images have some similar characteristics
with the training samples but are essentially different.
4.3. Component analysis
In this subsection, we analyze different components of
StackGAN on CUB dataset with our baseline models. The
inception scores for those baselines are reported in Table 2.
The design of StackGAN. As shown in the ﬁrst four
rows of Table 2, if Stage-I GAN is directly used to generate
images, the inception scores decrease signiﬁcantly. Such
performance drop can be well illustrated by results in Figure 7. As shown in the ﬁrst row of Figure 7, Stage-I GAN
fails to generate any plausible 256×256 samples without

the same for each input text description. (Row 2-3) with CA but
ﬁxing the noise vectors z, methods are still able to generate birds
with different poses and viewpoints.

using Conditioning Augmentation (CA). Although Stage-I
GAN with CA is able to generate more diverse 256×256
samples, those samples are not as realistic as samples generated by StackGAN. It demonstrates the necessity of the
proposed stacked structure. In addition, by decreasing the
output resolution from 256×256 to 128×128, the inception
score decreases from 3.70 to 3.35. Note that all images are
scaled to 299 × 299 before calculating the inception score.
Thus, if our StackGAN just increases the image size without
adding more information, the inception score would remain
the same for samples of different resolutions. Therefore, the
decrease in inception score by 128×128 StackGAN demonstrates that our 256×256 StackGAN does add more details
into the larger images. For the 256×256 StackGAN, if the
text is only input to Stage-I (denoted as “no Text twice”), the
inception score decreases from 3.70 to 3.45. It indicates that
processing text descriptions again at Stage-II helps reﬁne
Stage-I results. The same conclusion can be drawn from
the results of 128×128 StackGAN models.
Conditioning Augmentation. We also investigate the
efﬁcacy of the proposed Conditioning Augmentation (CA).
By removing it from StackGAN 256×256 (denoted as “no
CA” in Table 2), the inception score decreases from 3.70 to
3.31. Figure 7 also shows that 256×256 Stage-I GAN (and
StackGAN) with CA can generate birds with different poses

and viewpoints from the same text embedding. In contrast,
without using CA, samples generated by 256×256 Stage-
I GAN collapse to nonsensical images due to the unstable
training dynamics of GANs. Consequently, the proposed
Conditioning Augmentation helps stabilize the conditional
GAN training and improves the diversity of the generated
samples because of its ability to encourage robustness to
small perturbations along the latent manifold.
Sentence embedding interpolation. To further demonstrate that our StackGAN learns a smooth latent data manifold, we use it to generate images from linearly interpolated sentence embeddings, as shown in Figure 8. We ﬁx the
noise vector z, so the generated image is inferred from the
given text description only. Images in the ﬁrst row are generated by simple sentences made up by us. Those sentences
contain only simple color descriptions. The results show
that the generated images from interpolated embeddings
can accurately reﬂect color changes and generate plausible
bird shapes. The second row illustrates samples generated
from more complex sentences, which contain more details
on bird appearances. The generated images change their
primary color from red to blue, and change the wing color
from black to brown.
5. Conclusions
In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) with Conditioning Augmentation for synthesizing photo-realistic images. The proposed
method decomposes the text-to-image synthesis to a novel
sketch-reﬁnement process. Stage-I GAN sketches the object following basic color and shape constraints from given
text descriptions.
Stage-II GAN corrects the defects in
Stage-I results and adds more details, yielding higher resolution images with better image quality. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method. Compared to existing text-to-image
generative models, our method generates higher resolution
images (e.g., 256×256) with more photo-realistic details
and diversity.
