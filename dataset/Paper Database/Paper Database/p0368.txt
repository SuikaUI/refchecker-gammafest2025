To my family
The purpose of this book is to introduce the reader to the basic theory
of signal detection and estimation. It is assumed that the reader has a
working knowledge of applied probability and random processes such as
that taught in a typical first-semester graduate engineering course on these
subjects. This material is covered, for example, in the book by Wong 
in this series. More advanced concepts in these areas are introduced where
needed, primarily in Chapters VI and VII, where continuous-time problems
are treated.
This book is adapted from a one-semester, second-tier graduate course
taught at the University of Illinois and at Princeton University. However,
this material can also be used for a shorter or first-tier course by restricting
coverage to Chapters I through V, which for the most part can be read with
a background of only the basics of applied probability, including random
vectors and conditional expectations. Sufficient background for the latter
option is given for example in the book by Thomas , also in this
This treatment is also suitable for use as a text in other modes. For
example, two smaller courses, one in signal detection (Chapters II, III,
and VI) and one in estimation (Chapters IV, V, and VII), can be taught
from the materials as organized here. Similarly, an introductory-level course
(Chapters I through IV) followed by a more advanced course (Chapters V
through VII) is another possibility.
In preparing this second edition, the suggestions and comments of many
readers have been incorporated. Although these individuals are too numerous to be listed here, the author is grateful for their valuable advice.
