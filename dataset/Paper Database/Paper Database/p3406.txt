I present a density-matrix renormalization-group (DMRG) method for calculating dynamical
properties and excited states in low-dimensional lattice quantum many-body systems. The method
is based on an exact variational principle for dynamical correlation functions and the excited states
contributing to them. This dynamical DMRG is an alternate formulation of the correction vector
DMRG but is both simpler and more accurate. The ﬁnite-size scaling of spectral functions is discussed and a method for analyzing the scaling of dense spectra is described. The key idea of the
method is a size-dependent broadening of the spectrum. The dynamical DMRG and the ﬁnite-size
scaling analysis are demonstrated on the optical conductivity of the one-dimensional Peierls-Hubbard
model. Comparisons with analytical results show that the spectral functions of inﬁnite systems can
be reproduced almost exactly with these techniques. The optical conductivity of the Mott-Peierls
insulator is investigated and it is shown that its spectrum is qualitatively diﬀerent from the simple
spectra observed in Peierls (band) insulators and one-dimensional Mott-Hubbard insulators.

INTRODUCTION
The density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG)1,2
is a very successful numerical methods for calculating static properties of ground states and low-lying
eigenstates in quantum many-body systems.
For lowdimensional strongly correlated systems DMRG is as accurate as exact diagonalization techniques but can be
used to study much larger systems than with those techniques (currently, up to ∼103 sites). Using a ﬁnite-size
scaling analysis it is thus possible to determine the static
properties of a system in the thermodynamic limit with
great accuracy.
The calculation of dynamical properties and higher energy excitations with DMRG has proved to be more dif-
ﬁcult. Several approaches have been proposed but calculations have been carried out successfully for few problems only. The simplest of these methods is the Lanczos
DMRG.3,4 In practice, this method gives accurate results for the ﬁrst few moments of a dynamical spectrum.
Therefore, it works well for simple discrete spectra made
of a few peaks but it usually fails for more complicated
spectra. An alternate method for calculating dynamical
properties is the correction vector DMRG.4,5 Contrary to
the Lanczos DMRG, this method can describe complex or
dense spectra accurately. Nevertheless, there have been
few applications6,7 of correction vector DMRG until now
because this method is more diﬃcult and requires significantly more computer resources than the usual DMRG
method for calculating static properties at low energy.
In this paper I describe a simple and eﬃcient method,
called the dynamical DMRG (DDMRG), for calculating
dynamical properties and excited states with DMRG.
This approach is based on a variational principle for
dynamical correlation functions and the related excited
states. The variational principle is essentially an elegant
formulation of the correction vector technique. Because
of the variational formulation, however, the DDMRG
method is easier to use and signiﬁcantly more accurate
than the correction vector DMRG method.
While the spectrum of a ﬁnite system is necessarily discrete, continuous excitation bands are often found in the
thermodynamic limit. It is possible to broaden ﬁnite-size
spectra to simulate the continuum of an inﬁnite-system
Usually, the broadening is arbitrarily large
and no systematic quantitative analysis of ﬁnite-size effects is performed for the spectrum. Here I show that
dynamical properties of inﬁnite systems can be obtained
reliably using an appropriate ﬁnite-size scaling analysis.
The key to the analysis is the use of a broadening which
scales systematically with the system size.
The DDMRG method and the ﬁnite-size scaling technique for dynamical spectrum have already been successfully used to investigate the optical properties of
one-dimensional Mott insulators.8,9 Here I apply these
techniques to the calculation of the optical conductivity
in the one-dimensional Peierls-Hubbard model of conjugated polymers.10 Much eﬀort has been devoted to understanding the optical properties of these materials. In particular, the optical conductivity of the Peierls-Hubbard
model has been studied extensively and analytical results
have been obtained for various special cases, such as the
Mott-Hubbard insulator and the Peierls (band) insulator limits. Leaving out these special limits the Peierls-
Hubbard model describes a Mott-Peierls insulator and
its optical properties are still poorly understood. In this
paper I show that DDMRG can accurately reproduce the
known analytical results for the optical spectrum in the
thermodynamic limit. Then I investigate the optical conductivity of a Mott-Peierls insulator using DDMRG and
show that it displays speciﬁc features.
The paper is organized as follows: The variational principle for dynamical correlation functions and related excited states is presented in the next section. I describe
the dynamical DMRG method in Sec. III.
The ﬁnitesize scaling analysis is presented in Sec. IV.

and discuss the results for the optical conductivity of the
Peierls-Hubbard model in Sec. V. Finally, I conclude in
the last section.
VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE
The dynamic response of a quantum system to a timedependent perturbation is often given by dynamical correlation functions such as
GA(ω + iη) = −1
E0 + ω + iη −H A|ψ0⟩,
where H is the time-independent Hamiltonian of the system, E0 and |ψ0⟩are its ground-state energy and wavefunction, A is the quantum operator corresponding to
the physical quantity which is analyzed, and A† is the
Hermitian conjugate of A. A small real number η > 0
is used in the calculation to shift the poles of the correlation function into the complex plane. (I set ¯h = 1 in
sections II to IV.)
In general, we are interested in calculating the imaginary part of the correlation function
IA(ω + iη) = Im GA(ω + iη)
(E0 + ω −H)2 + η2 A|ψ0⟩
in the limit η →0
IA(ω) = lim
η→0 IA(ω + iη) ≥0 .
It should be noted that the spectrum IA(ω + iη) for any
ﬁnite η > 0 can be calculated from the spectrum IA(ω)
by convolution with a Lorentzian distribution
IA(ω + iη) = Cη[IA(ω)] > 0 ,
where I use the notation Cη[f(ω)] to represent the convolution of a spectral function f(ω) with a Lorentzian
distribution of width η
Cη[f(ω)] =
dω′f(ω′) 1
(ω −ω′)2 + η2 .
The moments of the spectrum IA(ω) fulﬁll sum rules such
dωIA(ω) = ⟨ψ0|A†A|ψ0⟩,
dωIA(ω)ω = ⟨ψ0|A†[H, A]|ψ0⟩,
dωIA(ω)ω2 = ⟨ψ0|[A†, H][H, A]|ψ0⟩,
where [A, B] = AB −BA.
A dynamical correlation function (1) can be calculated
using the correction vector method. The correction vector associated with GA(ω + iη) is deﬁned by
|ψA(ω + iη)⟩=
E0 + ω + iη −H |A⟩,
where |A⟩= A|ψ0⟩. If the correction vector is known, the
dynamical correlation function can be calculated directly
GA(ω + iη) = −1
π ⟨A|ψA(ω + iη)⟩.
To calculate a correction vector one ﬁrst solves an inhomogeneous linear equation
(E0 + ω −H)2 + η2
|ψ⟩= −η|A⟩,
which always has a unique solution |ψ⟩= |YA(ω + iη)⟩
for η ̸= 0. The correction vector is then given by
|ψA(ω + iη)⟩= |XA(ω + iη)⟩+ i|YA(ω + iη)⟩
|XA(ω + iη)⟩= H −E0 −ω
|YA(ω + iη)⟩.
One should note that the states |XA(ω+iη)⟩and |YA(ω+
iη)⟩are complex if the state |A⟩is not real, but they
always determine the real part and imaginary part of the
dynamical correlation function GA(ω + iη), respectively,
Re GA(ω + iη) = −1
π ⟨A|XA(ω + iη)⟩,
Im GA(ω + iη) = −1
π ⟨A|YA(ω + iη)⟩.
The derivatives of the real and imaginary parts can also
be calculated from these states
dω ReGA(ω + iη) = 1
π [⟨XA(ω + iη)|XA(ω + iη)⟩
−⟨YA(ω + iη)|YA(ω + iη)⟩] (13)
dω ImGA(ω + iη) = 2
π ⟨XA(ω + iη)|YA(ω + iη)⟩.
A well-established approach for solving an inhomogeneous linear equation (9) is to formulate it as a minimization problem. One considers the functional
WA,η(ω, ψ) = ⟨ψ|(E0 + ω −H)2 + η2|ψ⟩
+η⟨A|ψ⟩+ η⟨ψ|A⟩.
For any η ̸= 0 and a ﬁxed frequency ω this functional
has a well-deﬁned and non-degenerate minimum for the
quantum state which is solution of Eq. (9)
|ψmin⟩= |YA(ω + iη)⟩.
It is easy to show that the value of the minimum is
related to the imaginary part of the dynamical correlation
WA,η(ω, ψmin) = −πηIA(ω + iη).
Therefore, the calculation of spectral functions can be
formulated as a minimization problem.
To determine
IA(ω+iη) at any frequency ω and for any η > 0, one minimizes the corresponding functional WA,η(ω, ψ).
this minimization has been carried out, the real part of
the correlation function GA(ω + iη) can be calculated
using Eqs. (11) and (12a) if necessary. This is the variational principle for dynamical correlation functions.
It is clear that if we can calculate |YA(ω + iη)⟩exactly,
this variational formulation is completely equivalent to
the correction vector method. However, if we can only
calculate an approximate solution with an error of the order ǫ ≪1, |ψ⟩= |YA(ω + iη)⟩+ ǫ|φ⟩with ⟨φ|φ⟩= 1, the
variational formulation is more accurate. In the correction vector method the error in the spectrum IA(ω + iη)
calculated with Eq. (12b) is also of the order of ǫ. In
the variational approach it is easy to show that the error
in the value of the minimum WA,η(ω, ψmin), and thus in
IA(ω + iη), is of the order of ǫ2. With both methods the
error in the real part of GA(ω + iη) is of the order of ǫ.
One can write the function IA(ω) in the spectral form
(or Lehmann representation)
|⟨ψn|A|ψ0⟩|2δ(ω + E0 −En) ,
where |ψ0⟩is the ground state, |ψn⟩, n > 1, denotes the
other eigenstates of H, and E0, En are their respective
eigenenergies.
Obviously, only the eigenstates with a
ﬁnite matrix element ⟨ψn|A|ψ0⟩̸= 0 contribute to the
spectrum and here we are only interested in those excited
states. In the correction vector method the excitation energies En −E0 and the spectral weights |⟨ψn|A|ψ0⟩|2 can
be obtained from the poles of GA(ω + iη). The corresponding wavefunctions |ψn⟩can be calculated by taking
the η →0 limit of the correction vectors
η→0 |YA(En −E0 + iη)⟩.
The excited states contributing to GA(ω + iη) correspond to the local maxima of the spectrum IA(ω + iη)
for small enough η > 0. Therefore, they can also be obtained by minimization of the functional WA,η(ω, ψ) with
respect to both ω and ψ. The local minima of WA,η(ω, ψ)
are given by the conditions
ωmin + E0 = ⟨ψmin|H|ψmin⟩
⟨ψmin|ψmin⟩
|ψmin⟩= |YA(ωmin + iη)⟩.
In the limit η →0, ωmin + E0 tends to the energy En of
an eigenstate with ﬁnite spectral weight, |ψmin⟩is equal
to the corresponding eigenstate |ψn⟩up to a normalization constant, and −WA,η(ωmin, ψmin) tends to the spectral weight |⟨ψn|A|ψ0⟩|2. This is the variational principle
for excited states contributing to a dynamical correlation
function GA(ω + iη).
Again this variational formulation is completely equivalent to the correction vector method if |YA(ω + iη)⟩can
be calculated exactly.
In an approximate calculation,
however, errors in the eigenenergies and spectral weights
are of the order of ǫ with the correction vector method,
while they are of the order of ǫ2 with the variational formulation.
DYNAMICAL DMRG
DMRG is a numerical method for calculating the properties of lattice quantum many-body systems. It is described in detail in several publications (for instance, see
Refs. 1 and 2). DMRG can be considered as a variational
approach. The system energy
E(ψ) = ⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩
is minimized in a variational subspace (the DMRG basis) of the system Hilbert space to ﬁnd the ground-state
wavefunction |ψ0⟩and energy E0 = E(ψ0). If the groundstate wavefunction is calculated with an error of the order
of ǫ ≪1 (i.e., |ψ⟩= |ψ0⟩+ ǫ|φ⟩with ⟨φ|φ⟩= 1), the energy obtained is an upper bound to the exact result and
the error in the energy is of the order of ǫ2 (as in all
variational approaches). In principle, the DMRG energy
error is proportional to the weight of the density-matrix
eigenstates discarded in the renormalization procedure.
This discarded weight can be reduced by increasing the
number m of density-matrix eigenstates kept in the calculation, which corresponds to an increase of the variational subspace dimension. Therefore, the energy error
systematically decreases with increasing m in a DMRG
calculation.
The DMRG procedure used to minimize the energy
functional (20) can also be used to minimize the functional WA,η(ω, ψ) and thus to calculate the dynamical
correlation function GA(ω + iη).
I call this approach
the dynamical DMRG method. The minimization of the
functional WA,η(ω, ψ) is easily integrated into the usual
DMRG algorithm.
At every step of a DMRG sweep
through the system lattice, a superblock representing the
system is built and the following calculations are performed in the the superblock subspace:
1. The energy functional E(ψ) is minimized using
a standard iterative algorithm for the eigenvalue
problem. This yields the ground state vector |ψ0⟩
and its energy E0 in the superblock subspace.
2. The state |A⟩is calculated.
3. The functional WA,η(ω, ψ) is minimized using an
iterative minimization algorithm.
This gives the
ﬁrst part of the correction vector |YA(ω + iη)⟩and
the imaginary part IA(ω + iη) of the dynamical
correlation function.
4. The second part |XA(ω+iη)⟩of the correction vector is calculated using Eq. (11).
5. The real part and the derivatives of the dynamical correlation function can be calculated from
Eqs. (12a) and (13), respectively.
6. The four states |ψ0⟩, |A⟩, |YA(ω+iη)⟩, and |XA(ω+
iη)⟩are included as target in the density-matrix
renormalization to build a new superblock at the
next step.
The robust ﬁnite-system DMRG algorithm must be used
to perform several sweeps through a lattice of ﬁxed size.
Sweeps are repeated until the procedure has converged to
the minimum of both functionals E(ψ) and WA,η(ω, ψ).
To obtain the dynamical correlation function GA(ω +
iη) over a range of frequencies, one has to repeat this calculation for several frequencies ω. If the DDMRG calculations are performed independently, the computational
eﬀort is roughly proportional to the number of frequencies. It is also possible to carry out a DDMRG calculation
for several frequencies simultaneously, including several
states |XA(ω + iη)⟩and |YA(ω + iη)⟩with diﬀerent frequencies ω as target. The optimal number of diﬀerent
frequencies to be included in a single calculation depends
strongly on the problem studied and the computer used.
As calculations for diﬀerent frequencies are essentially independent, it would be easy and very eﬃcient to perform
these calculations on a parallel computer.
If one performs a DDMRG calculation for two close
frequencies ω1 and ω2 simultaneously, it is possible to calculate the dynamical correlation function for additional
frequencies ω between ω1 and ω2 without including the
corresponding states |XA(ω+iη)⟩and |YA(ω+iη)⟩as target in the density-matrix renormalization. This approach
can signiﬁcantly reduce the computer time necessary to
determine the spectrum over a frequency range but the
results obtained for ω ̸= ω1, ω2 are less accurate and not
always reliable, as the DMRG basis is optimized for the
frequencies ω1 and ω2 only. (A similar technique is the
calculation of spectra with the Lanczos algorithm in the
DMRG basis optimized for a pair of correction vectors,
see Ref. 4.)
Alternatively, between the frequencies for
which GA(ω + iη) is determined directly with DDMRG,
we can calculate the dynamical correlation function by
interpolation using the DDMRG data for the function
and its derivative.
If a complete spectrum IA(ω + iη) has been obtained,
it is possible to calculate the moments of the spectral
distribution [the left-hand-side of Eq. (6)]. The ﬁrst few
moments [the right-hand-side of Eq. (6)] can be calculated accurately using the Lanczos DMRG method.3,4
This provides an independent check of DDMRG results.
[Note that only the ﬁrst sum rule (6) is satisﬁed exactly
for η > 0.]
To calculate individual excited states contributing to
the spectrum in a given frequency range (ω1, ω2), one includes a minimization of WA,η(ω, ψ) with respect to ω
(ω1 < ω < ω2) in the third step of the DDMRG algorithm described above. In this case, |YA(ωmin + iη)⟩and
|XA(ωmin + iη)⟩are included as target in the sixth step.
The parameter η must be much smaller than the distance En+1 −En between two successive eigenstates contributing to the dynamical correlation function or must
decrease during the calculation until the desired accuracy is obtained.
To make the procedure robust it is
necessary to simultaneously target a second correction
vector |ψA(ω + iη)⟩with a ﬁxed frequency and a parameter η of the order of the frequency range. Typically, I
use ω = (ω1 + ω2)/2 and η = (ω2 −ω1)/4.
Because of the variational principle one naively expects that the DDMRG results for IA(ω + iη) must converge monotonically from below to the exact result as the
number m of density-matrix eigenstates is increased. In
practice, the convergence is not always regular because
of two approximations made to calculate the functional
WA,η(ω, ψ) in a DMRG basis. First, the ground-state
energy E0 and the state |A⟩used in the deﬁnition (14)
of WA,η(ω, ψ) are not known exactly but calculated with
DMRG. If the number m of density matrix eigenstates
is increased, E0 and |A⟩are modiﬁed (they become progressively more accurate) and the functional WA,η(ω, ψ)
is changed, which can aﬀect its minimum arbitrarily. We
also note that errors of the order of ǫ in E0 or |A⟩result in errors of the same order in IA(ω + iη). Therefore,
to observe a regular convergence with increasing m and
to obtain accurate results for IA(ω + iη), it is necessary
in the ﬁrst place to determine the ground state and the
state |A⟩with great precision (and thus to include the
state |A⟩as target).
To calculate the functional WA,η(ω, ψ) in the third step
of the DDMRG algorithm, one needs an eﬀective representation of the operator (H −E0−ω)2 in the superblock
[(H −E0 −ω)2]eﬀ= O†(H −E0 −ω)2O ,
where the operator O represents the projection onto the
superblock subspace. For a typical many-body Hamiltonian H such a calculation is excessively complicated
and computationally intensive. Therefore, I calculate an
eﬀective representation of H only, Heﬀ= O†HO, and
assume that
[(H −E0 −ω)2]eﬀ≈(Heﬀ−E0 −ω)2
to calculate WA,η(ω, ψ) in the superblock subspace. This
second approximation can cause a violation of the variational bound WA,η(ω, ψ) ≥−πηIA(ω + iη). Fortunately,
the substitution (22) has no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the minimum of WA,η(ω, ψ) if the state (H−E0−ω)|YA(ω+iη)⟩∝
|XA(ω+iη)⟩is accurately represented in the DMRG basis
[i.e., if O|XA(ω + iη)⟩≈|XA(ω + iη)⟩for all superblock
subspaces]. Therefore, to use the substitution (22) without loss of accuracy it is necessary and suﬃcient to include the state |XA(ω + iη)⟩as a target in a DDMRG
calculation, even if the real part of the dynamical correlation function is not calculated.
In practice, for suﬃciently large m I have found that
the absolute values of errors in a spectrum IA(ω + iη)
decrease systematically with increasing m. Therefore, it
is possible to estimate the accuracy of a DDMRG calculation from the results obtained for diﬀerent values of
m as one can do for static properties calculated with
DMRG. Moreover, DDMRG results for IA(ω + iη) tend
to be smaller than the exact result for almost all frequencies although they can exceed it occasionally.
Obviously, DDMRG is very similar to the correction
vector DMRG.4,5 The same DMRG basis is built because
the same target states are used in both methods. As numerical errors are usually dominated by the DMRG basis
truncation, the correction vector parts |XA(ω + iη)⟩and
|YA(ω + iη)⟩are calculated with the same precision ǫ in
both methods for a given number m of density-matrix
eigenstates kept per block. Nevertheless, the variational
formulation has two signiﬁcant advantages.
First, the
errors in the spectrum IA(ω + iη), the excitation energies En −E0, and the spectral weights are of the order
of ǫ2 instead of ǫ in the correction vector method, as
explained in Sec. II. If one uses the Lanczos algorithm
instead of Eq. (8) in the correction vector DMRG, errors
become even larger. Therefore, DDMRG results are more
accurate than those obtained with the correction vector
DMRG for a given number m of density-matrix eigenstates. Second, a DDMRG calculation is essentially an
application of the standard DMRG algorithm to the minimization of a diﬀerent functional. In particular, the numerical accuracy and computational eﬀort are controlled
by the sole parameter m in an optimized DDMRG calculation as in a ground-state DMRG calculation. The
correction vector DMRG4,5 and Lanczos DMRG3,4 are
signiﬁcantly more complicated than the standard DMRG
method. In particular, the numerical accuracy and computational eﬀort depend signiﬁcantly and sometimes unpredictably on the speciﬁc states (Lanczos vectors and
correction vectors) included as target in the densitymatrix renormalization. Therefore, it is easier to implement and use DDMRG than the correction vector DMRG
or the Lanczos DMRG.
FINITE-SIZE SCALING
DDMRG allows us to calculate spectral functions of
a correlated electron (or spin) system on a ﬁnite lattice
with a broadening given by the parameter η > 0. They
have the generic form
IN,η(ω) = 1
(ωn(N) −ω)2 + η2 ,
where ωn(N) denotes the excitation energy and An(N) >
0 the spectral weight of the system eigenstates, and N is
the number of lattice sites. Such spectra are discrete for
η →0 because there is only a ﬁnite number of eigenstates
in a ﬁnite system. In the thermodynamic limit a spectral
I(ω) = lim
N→∞IN,η(ω)
can contain discrete and continuous parts. (It should be
noted that the order of limits in the above formula is
important.) To determine the properties of a dynamical
spectrum I(ω) in the thermodynamic limit one has to
analyze the scaling of the corresponding spectra IN,η(ω)
as a function of system size. Here I present a ﬁnite-size
scaling technique for spectral functions calculated with a
numerical method such as DDMRG.
Computing both limits in Eq. (24) from numerical results for IN,η(ω) requires a lot of accurate data for different values of η and N and can be the source of large
extrapolation errors. A much better approach is to use a
broadening η(N) > 0 which decreases with increasing N
and vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. The dynamical
spectrum is then given by
N→∞IN,η(N)(ω)
(ωn(N) −ω)2 + η2(N) .
From the existence of both limits in Eq. (24) it can
be demonstrated that there exists a minimal broadening η0(N) ≥0, which decreases as a function of N and
converges to zero for N →∞, such that the above equation is valid for all functions η(N) with η(N) > η0(N)
and limN→∞η(N) = 0. The function η0(N) depends on
the frequency ω considered. For a ﬁnite lattice with N
sites, let Mω,ǫ(N) be the number of excited states contributing to the spectral function in a small interval of
width ǫ around the frequency ω (i.e., |ωn(N)−ω| < ǫ/2).
If Mω,ǫ(N) remains ﬁnite for any ǫ > 0 as N →∞, the
spectral function I(ω) is discrete at ω and η0(N) = 0.
Equivalently, one can take the η →0 limit ﬁrst in
Eq. (24). If Mω,ǫ(N) diverges for all ǫ > 0 as N →∞,
the spectrum is dense at ω and a minimal broadening η0(N) > 0 is required for Eq. (25) to be valid.
For instance, η0(N) must be larger than the distance
δω = ωn+1(N) −ωn(N) between two consecutive excited
states in the spectrum.
Note that while a continuous
spectrum is obviously dense, a dense spectrum can be
continuous or discrete. For instance, an inﬁnite number
of excited states with An(N) > 0 can converge to the
same energy as N →∞. This seems to happen for the
optical conductivity associated with an exciton in a open
The function η0(N) depends naturally on the speciﬁc
problem studied [i.e., the scaling of the energies ωn(N)
and spectral weights An(N)]. For the optical conductivity of one-dimensional correlated electron systems such
as the Peierls-Hubbard model, I have found numerically
that a suﬃcient condition for all frequencies ω in a dense
part of the optical spectrum is
where the constant c is comparable to the width of the
dynamical spectrum I(ω), which is ﬁnite in such lattice
models. Usually, one wants to keep the broadening η as
small as possible because it reduces the resolution of the
spectrum. Therefore, I use
in Eq. (25) to analyze the ﬁnite-size scaling of spectral
functions calculated with DDMRG and to extrapolate
the ﬁnite-size results to the thermodynamic limit. The
condition (26) has a very simple physical interpretation.
The spectral function IN,η(ω) represents the dynamical
response of the system over a time period ∼1/η after
one has started to apply an external force.
Typically,
in a lattice model the spectral width is proportional to
the velocity of the excitations involved in the system response. Thus the condition (26) means that excitations
are too slow to travel the full length ∼N of the system
in the time interval ∼1/η and do not “sense” that the
system is ﬁnite.
An additional beneﬁt of a broadening satisfying the
condition (26) is that the ﬁnite-system spectrum IN,η(ω)
becomes indistinguishable from the inﬁnite-system spectrum with the same broadening η for relatively small N,
IN,η(ω) ≈Cη[I(ω)].
Therefore, if one knows an exact or conjectured spectral function I(ω) for an inﬁnite system, its convolution
with a Lorentzian of width η can be compared directly
with the numerical results for the ﬁnite-system spectrum
IN,η(ω). This approach has been applied successfully to
the optical conductivity of one-dimensional Mott insulators in Refs. 8 and 9, and additional examples are presented in the next section.
In practice, the extrapolation scheme (25) works well
at ﬁxed frequency for the continuous parts and the nondense discrete parts of a spectrum I(ω) only. To detect
singularities in I(ω) and determine their properties, it
is generally easier to analyze the scaling of maxima in
IN,η(ω) or in its derivative as N →∞and η →0. To
perform this scaling analysis one can use a size-dependent
broadening η(N) such that Eq. (25) is valid and IN,η(ω)
is a good approximation of Cη[I(ω)] around the maximum.
Then the scaling of a maximum in IN,η(ω) for
η(N) →0 gives the scaling of the corresponding maximum in Cη[I(ω)] for η →0. Here I discuss some examples
of this technique which are useful for the analysis of the
Peierls-Hubbard model optical conductivity presented in
the next section. [One should also note that to detect the
presence of a gap between two bands in an inﬁnite-system
spectrum I(ω), it is often faster and more reliable to investigate the scaling of minima in IN,η(ω) for η(N) →0
than to perform extrapolations at ﬁxed frequencies.]
First, we consider an inﬁnite-system spectrum with a
peak in a continuous band,
I(ω) = I0δ(ω −ω0) + Icont(ω)
for |ω−ω0| < Λ, where I0 > 0 and Icont(ω) is a continuous
function. It is easy to show that for η ≪Λ the maximum
of Cη[I(ω)] diverges as I0/(πη) and that the position of
the maximum converges to ω0 for η →0. The maximum
of the corresponding ﬁnite-system spectra IN,η(ω) has
the same scaling properties for η(N) →0. Therefore,
it is possible to detect such a δ-peak and determine its
weight I0 in an inﬁnite-system spectrum, even if I0 is
only a small fraction of the total spectral weight of Icont.
Second, we consider an inﬁnite-system spectrum with
a power-law divergence at the band edge
I(ω) = I0θ(ω −ω0)|ω −ω0|−α
for |ω −ω0| < Λ, where θ(x) = 0 for x < 0 and θ(x) = 1
for x > 0, I0 > 0, and 0 < α < 1.
One can show
that for η ≪Λ the maximum of Cη[I(ω)] diverges as
η−α and that the position of the maximum converges to
ω0 from above for η →0. Again, the maximum of the
corresponding ﬁnite-system spectra IN,η(ω) has the same
scaling properties for η(N) →0. Thus it is possible to
detect such a singularity and determine the exponent α
from the ﬁnite-system numerical data.
Third, we consider a continuous inﬁnite-system spectrum with a singularity in its derivative
I(ω) = I0θ(ω −ω0)|ω −ω0|α
for |ω −ω0| < Λ, where the function θ(x) and the constants I0 and α are as in the previous example. Here the
derivative of Cη[I(ω)] has a maximum which diverges
as ηα−1 for η ≪Λ while its position converges to ω0
from above as η →0. The maximum in the derivative
of IN,η(ω) has the same scaling properties for η(N) →0.
Therefore, it is possible to determine the exponent α from
the ﬁnite-system numerical data in this case too.
Finally, we consider a special function representing a
continuous spectrum above a gap and a truncated divergence close to the band edge
I(ω) = I0θ(ω −ω0) 2
γω0 + |ω −ω0|
for |ω −ω0| < Λ, where γ is a constant such that
0 ≤γ < Λ/ω0. The function θ(x) and the other constants are as in the previous examples. For γ > 0 this
spectrum vanishes as a square-root at the band edge ω0,
goes trough a maximum I0/√γ at ω = (1+γ)ω0 then decreases monotonically. For γ ≪1 the maximum is very
sharp and close to the band edge, and I(ω) appears to diverge as 1/
|ω −ω0| at higher energy ω > (1+γ)ω0. The
continuous vanishing of I(ω) at the band edge is apparent only in a small frequency range ω0 < ω < (1 + γ)ω0.
As γ →0 this maximum becomes a square-root singularity at ω0. A qualitatively similar behavior is often found
in the optical conductivity of one-dimensional insulators
(see the discussion in the next section). Obviously, the
maximum of Cη[I(ω)] tends to I0/√γ and its position
converges to ω = (1 + γ)ω0 for η →0.
For γ < 1,
however, the convergence of the maximum becomes apparent only for η ≪γω0.
For larger η the maximum
appears to diverge as 1/√η. Similarly, the maximum of
the derivative diverges as 1/√η for η →0 as discussed
the previous example. In the present case, however, this
scaling is not observed as soon as η ≪Λ but only if
η ≪γω0. The ﬁnite-system spectrum IN,η(ω) and its
derivative have the same scaling properties for η(N) →0.
Therefore, with the scaling analysis of ﬁnite-system spectra it is possible to distinguish an inﬁnite-system spectrum with a truncated divergence above the band edge
from a spectrum with a real divergence at the band edge,
provided that one can do calculations with a resolution
η(N) ≪γω0.
In summary, the dynamical spectrum of an inﬁnite system can be determined accurately and eﬃciently from
numerical data for ﬁnite-system spectra using a sizedependent broadening η(N). The broadening η(N) must
be larger than a minimal broadening η0(N), which depends on the system investigated and can vary with the
frequency. Often this broadening conceals the ﬁnite-size
eﬀects and one can directly compare ﬁnite-system spectra to analytical results for inﬁnite systems using a convolution with a Lorentzian distribution, see Eq. (28). If
this comparison is not possible or not suﬃcient, speciﬁc
points of the spectrum can be extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit using Eq. (25). Finally, the scaling of
maxima in ﬁnite-system spectra or their derivatives [for
η(N) →0] allows us to ﬁnd and analyze singularities in
the inﬁnite-system spectrum. For one-dimensional correlated electron systems a suﬃcient condition for the minimal broadening is given by Eq. (26) and one can use a
size-dependent broadening (27).
OPTICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF THE
PEIERLS-HUBBARD MODEL
In this section I apply the DDMRG method and the
ﬁnite-size scaling analysis to the optical conductivity
of the one-dimensional Peierls-Hubbard model.10 This
model is deﬁned by the Hamiltonian
t −(−1)l ∆
l,σcl+1,σ + c+
It describes electrons with spin σ =↑, ↓which can hop between neighboring sites in a lattice with an even number
N of sites. In Eq. (34) the index l runs from 1 to N −1
for an open chain and from 1 to N if periodic boundary conditions are used. Here c+
l,σ, cl,σ are creation and
annihilation operators for electrons with spin σ at site l
and nl,σ = c+
l,σcl,σ are the corresponding density operators. The hopping integral t > 0 gives rise to a singleelectron band of width 4t. The dimerization parameter
0 ≤|∆| ≤2t determines the strength of the periodic lattice potential generated by the Peierls instability. (For
a ﬁnite open chain I only use ∆≥0 to avoid spurious
excitations at the chain ends.) The Coulomb repulsion
is mimicked by a local Hubbard interaction U ≥0. The
number of electrons equals the number of lattice sites.
The ground state, single-particle charge gap and spin
gap of this system can be calculated with great accuracy
on lattices with up to N ∼103 sites using DMRG. The
single-particle charge gap is given by
Ec(N) = E0(N + 1) + E0(N −1) −2E0(N) ,
where E0(M) denotes the ground-state energy for M
electrons in a N-site system.
For an even number N
of sites and electrons the Peierls-Hubbard model ground
state is a singlet11 and the spin gap is given by
Es(N) = E0(Sz = ¯h) −E0(Sz = 0) ,
where Sz is the the z-component of the total spin and
E0(Sz) is the ground-state energy for a ﬁxed value of Sz.
Spectroscopy with electromagnetic radiation is a common experimental probe of solid-state materials.
linear optical absorption is proportional to the real part
σ1(ω) of the optical conductivity. For ω > 0, σ1(ω) is
related to the imaginary part of the current-current correlation function GJ(¯hω + iη) by
η→0 Im GJ(¯hω + iη)
|⟨ψ0|J|ψn⟩|2 δ(¯hω + E0 −En) .
Here |ψ0⟩is the ground state of the Hamiltonian H,
|ψn⟩(n > 1) are the other eigenstates of H, and E0, En
are their respective eigenenergies. In this model the current operator is
t −(−1)l ∆
l,σcl+1,σ −c+
where a is the lattice constant, −e is the charge of an
electron, and the index l takes the same values depending
on the boundary conditions as in Eq. (34). Note that this
is the natural deﬁnition of the current operator for both
types of boundary conditions.
The Parzen ﬁlter used
for open boundary conditions in other works6,7 is not
necessary and thus not used in this work.
In an open chain the optical absorption is also related
to the dynamical polarizability α(ω), which is given by
the imaginary part of the dipole-dipole correlation function GD(¯hω + iη),
η→0 Im GD(¯hω + iη)
|⟨ψ0|D|ψn⟩|2 δ(¯hω + E0 −En) .
For a constant lattice spacing a the dipole operator is
with nl = nl,↑+ nl,↓. Using the relation J = −i
one easily proves that
σ1(ω) = ωα(ω)
η→0 Im{(¯hω + iη) GD(¯hω + iη)} .
The optical conductivity can be calculated with the
DDMRG method described in this paper. For an open
chain Eqs. (37),(39), and (42) provide us with three different approaches.
First, one can calculate the imaginary part of the current-current correlation function with
DDMRG and use Eq. (37) to obtain the convolution of
the reduced optical conductivity
Cη[ωσ1(ω)] =
NaIm GJ(¯hω + iη)
η|⟨ψ0|J|ψn⟩|2
(¯hω + E0 −En)2 + η2 .
This is also the only approach possible with periodic
boundary conditions.
Second, one can calculate the
imaginary part of the dipole-dipole correlation function
with DDMRG and use Eq. (39) to obtain the convolution
of the dynamical polarizability
Cη[α(ω)] =
NaIm GD(¯hω + iη)
η|⟨ψ0|D|ψn⟩|2
(¯hω + E0 −En)2 + η2 .
The optical conductivity is then given by the relation (41).
Finally, one can calculate the complete
dipole-dipole correlation function with DDMRG and use
Eq. (42) to obtain the convolution of σ1(ω) directly
Cη[σ1(ω)] =
Na¯hIm{(¯hω + iη) GD(¯hω + iη)} (45)
η|⟨ψ0|D|ψn⟩|2(En −E0)
(¯hω + E0 −En)2 + η2
Cη[σ1(ω)] can also be formulated in terms of the current
matrix elements |⟨ψ0|J|ψn⟩|2 [see Eq. (4) of Ref. 9]. Although the real part of a dynamical correlation function
is used in Eq. (45) to calculate the optical conductivity, its relative contribution to Cη[σ1(ω)] is of the order
(η/t)2. Therefore, the numerical precision is not signiﬁcantly reduced by the lower accuracy of DDMRG for the
real part of dynamical correlation functions.
Clearly, all three approaches give the same spectrum
σ1(ω) for η →0. In DDMRG calculations with η > 0,
however, they are not equivalent.
First, I have found
that it is easier to calculate the dipole-dipole correlation
function GD(¯hω + iη) than the current-current correlation function GJ(¯hω + iη), except for very strong coupling U ≫t. Second, the ﬁnite-size scaling [using a sizedependent broadening (27)] is diﬀerent for the three optical spectra Cη[ωσ1(ω)]/ω, ωCη[α(ω)], and Cη[σ1(ω)],
especially for very small and very large frequencies ω.
Usually, Cη[σ1(ω)] is the best approximation to σ1(ω)
but at low energy (¯hω < t) it can be more convenient
to use ωCη[α(ω)] while at high energy (¯hω ≫t) I prefer
Cη[ωσ1(ω)].
To calculate the optical spectrum of the Peierls-
Hubbard model I have used the third approach, Eq. (45),
in most cases. Thus Cη[σ1(ω)] is shown in the ﬁgures of
this paper unless I state explicitly otherwise. Only optical spectra calculated with open boundary conditions
are presented.
As the size-dependent broadening (27)
conceals most of the ﬁnite-size eﬀects, spectra calculated with periodic boundary conditions would be almost identical. In all ﬁgures showing optical spectra I
set a = e = ¯h = t = 1. Thus σ1(ω) is shown in units of
e2a/¯h, ωσ1(ω) in units of e2at/¯h2, and the frequency ω
in units of ¯h/t.
The sum rules (6) take a simple form for the optical conductivity in the Peierls-Hubbard model with open
boundary conditions
dωωσ1(ω) =
Na ⟨ψ0|J2|ψ0⟩,
2N¯h ⟨ψ0|T |ψ0⟩,
Na ⟨ψ0|D2|ψ0⟩.
To prove the second sum rule (46b) one uses the relation [D, J] = −ia2e2T/¯h. With periodic boundary conditions, only the ﬁrst two sum rules remain valid. In the
second sum rule, however, one must take into account
the coherent part of the conductivity at ω = 0 and the
proof is more complicated than for an open chain.
The right-hand-side of Eq. (46) can be calculated accurately with the ground-state or Lanczos DMRG method.
Note that for η > 0 an optical spectrum calculated from
Eq. (43), (45), or (44) exactly fulﬁlls the sum rule (46a),
(46b), or (46c), respectively.
For the DDMRG results
presented in this paper, the sum rules are fulﬁlled within
a few percents.
The optical gap Eopt(N) is deﬁned as the excitation
energy (En −E0) of the lowest eigenstate contributing
to the optical conductivity (i.e., ⟨ψn|J|ψ0⟩̸= 0) in a Nsite system. Eopt(N) can be calculated with the DDMRG
method for individual excited states described in Sec. III.
As the Peierls-Hubbard Hamiltonian (33) has a particlehole symmetry the optical gap can also be determined
using the symmetrized DMRG method.12 As expected,
both approaches give the same results for Eopt(N) within
numerical errors. In the thermodynamic limit (N →∞) I
have found that the optical gap Eopt is equal to the singleparticle charge gap Ec (35) for all U ≥0 and 2t > ∆≥0.
[In the dimer limit (∆= 2t) the Hamiltonian (33) describes independent dimers: the optical weight is concentrated in a single peak corresponding to Frenkel excitons localized on a dimer and the other (delocalized)
excitations above and below this peak carry not optical
weight, thus Ec < Eopt.] In a ﬁnite system or with additional electronic interactions9 the single-particle charge
gap Ec can be diﬀerent from the optical gap Eopt.
All DMRG methods have a truncation error which is
reduced by increasing the number m of retained density
matrix eigenstates (for more details, see Refs. 1 and 2).
Varying m allows one to compute physical quantities for
diﬀerent truncation errors and thus to obtain error estimates on these quantities. For some quantities, especially eigenenergies, it is possible to extrapolate the results to the limit of vanishing truncation error and thus
to achieve a greater accuracy. I have systematically used
these procedures to estimate the precision of my numerical calculations and adjusted the maximal number m of
density matrix eigenstates to reach a desired accuracy.
This is especially important for DDMRG calculations as
truncation errors in dynamical spectra can greatly vary
as a function of the frequency ω for ﬁxed m. In this work
the largest number of density matrix eigenstates used is
m = 600. For all numerical results presented here DMRG
truncation errors are negligible.
In the following three subsections I demonstrate the
ﬁnite-size scaling technique and the accuracy of DDMRG
on three special limits of the Peierls-Hubbard model.
Then the optical conductivity of a Mott-Peierls insulator is presented and discussed in the last subsection.
Peierls insulator
For U = 0 the Hamiltonian (33) describes a system
of independent electrons, which can be solved exactly
for any value of ∆, boundary conditions, or lattice size.
This provides us with a perfect test case for the DDMRG
I have checked that DDMRG can reproduce
the optical spectrum of this system on lattices with several hundred sites, for any frequency ω, and with relative errors as small as 10−4 using only a few hundred
density-matrix eigenstates. This demonstrates that one
can obtain almost exact results for the optical conductivity of ﬁnite one-dimensional systems such as the Peierls-
Hubbard model using DDMRG.
In the thermodynamic limit the Hamiltonian (33) describes a Peierls (band) insulating phase for ∆̸= 0 and
U = 0. The optical gap Eopt, the charge gap Ec, and the
spin gap Es equal 2|∆|.
Optical excitations are made
of one hole in the valence band and one electron in the
conduction band. The optical conductivity is given by
ae2(2∆)2(4t)2
2¯h(¯hω)2p
[(¯hω)2 −(2∆)2][(4t)2 −(¯hω)2]
Optical conductivity of a Peierls insulator with
∆= 0.6t and a broadening η/t = 0.05. Both the DDMRG
result for a 128-site chain and the exact result (47) in the
thermodynamic limit are shown.
for 2|∆| < ¯hω < 4t and is zero elsewhere.13 This optical
spectrum contains a single band of width 4t −2|∆| with
square-root divergences at both band edges. These divergences are a typical feature of a one-dimensional band
insulator. The convolution of Eq. (47) with a Lorentzian
distribution of width η/t = 0.05 is shown in Fig. 1 for
∆= 0.6t. Both divergences are replaced by maxima at
¯hω ≈2∆= 1.2t and ¯hω ≈4t. In Fig. 1 I also show the
optical conductivity calculated with DDMRG on a 128site lattice with the same broadening. We see that the
ﬁnite-system optical spectrum is indistinguishable from
the inﬁnite-system spectrum. The broadening η/t = 0.05
satisﬁes the condition (26) and thus conceals the ﬁnitesize eﬀects as discussed in Sec IV. In this case a broadening η(N)/t = 6.4/N is enough because the spectrum
band width is smaller than 4t.
With this size-dependent broadening η(N) one can use
Eq. (25) to extrapolate the ﬁnite-size DDMRG results to
the thermodynamic limit. For instance, for ¯hω = 2.6t I
have obtained σ1(ω) = 0.245 (in units of ae2/¯h) using
data for systems with up to N = 256 sites [i.e., with a
broadening down to η(N)/t = 0.025], in excellent agreement with the exact result 0.243. If we did not know the
exact result (47), we could nevertheless determine the
existence of square-root divergences at both band edges
using a scaling analysis of the maxima in the DDMRG
spectra. For instance, the height of the low-energy maximum (close to ¯hω = 1.2t) diverges as 1/√η for η(N) →0
[see Fig. 2(a)]. Moreover, the position of the maximum
tends from above to the optical gap Eopt = 2∆= 1.2t
for N →∞[see Fig. 2(b)]. As explained in Sec. IV these
scaling properties correspond to a square-root divergence
at the band edge.
Figure 2(b) also shows the ﬁnitesize optical gaps Eopt(N) calculated with the DDMRG
method for individual excited states. They tend to the
exact result Eopt = 1.2t for N →∞as expected.

[∆= 0.6t, η(N)N = 6.4t].
Mott-Hubbard insulator
For ∆= 0 the Peierls-Hubbard model (33) becomes
the one-dimensional Hubbard model at half ﬁlling. For
U > 0 this model describes a Mott-Hubbard insulator
with gapless spin excitations.14 The optical conductivity of this system has recently been determined using
DDMRG and analytical methods.8 Here I only summarize the most important results and give more information about the ﬁnite-size scaling analysis carried out in
this previous work.
In the half-ﬁlled Hubbard model an optical excitation
is made of a pair of spinless bosonic excitations carrying
opposite charges in the lower (holon) and upper (doublon or anti-holon) Hubbard bands, respectively. As in a
Peierls insulator, the optical spectrum consists of a single
band but its width is larger, about 8t. A second distinctive feature of this spectrum is a square-root vanishing
¯hω −Eopt at the band threshold Eopt. There
is also a tiny peak in the middle of the band, at least for
In Ref. 8 it is shown that for weak coupling (U ≤3t)
and in the strong-coupling limit (U/t →∞) the ﬁnitesystem optical spectra calculated with DDMRG agree

U = 3t for several values of η. Results for η(N) > 0 have been

For η = 0 the ﬁeld-theoretical result for an inﬁnite
system is shown.
perfectly with the analytical results obtained in the thermodynamic limit using a ﬁeld-theoretical approach and
a strong-coupling analysis, respectively.
For instance,
Fig. 3 shows the low-energy parts of DDMRG spectra calculated for three diﬀerent lattice sizes at U = 3t and the
corresponding ﬁeld-theoretical spectrum for an inﬁnite
system. A size-dependent broadening η(N)/t = 12.8/N
is used in this case. One clearly sees the convergence of
the ﬁnite-size spectra toward the ﬁeld-theoretical result
as η(N) decreases. To make a quantitative comparison
one can calculate the convolution of the ﬁeld-theoretical
spectrum with a Lorentzian of width η satisfying the condition (26) as discussed in Sec. IV. One ﬁnds then that
ﬁnite-size eﬀects are completely concealed by the broadening even for relatively small system sizes. For instance,
it is shown in Fig. 3 of Ref. 8 that the low-energy optical
spectrum calculated on a 128-site lattice for U = 3t is indistinguishable from the ﬁeld-theoretical spectrum with
the same broadening η/t = 0.1. In the strong-coupling
limit DDMRG and analytical results agree even better
and ﬁnite-size eﬀects are no longer visible for systems as
small as N = 32.
For other coupling strengths (4 ≤U/t < ∞) it is necessary to analyze the scaling of the ﬁnite-system DDMRG
spectra to determine the optical conductivity of the Hubbard model in the thermodynamic limit. Using numerical
results for lattices with up to N = 256 sites [i.e., a resolution η(N)/t down to 0.05], I have found that for all U/t
the optical conductivity at the lower band edge has the
qualitative behavior described by Eq. (32): σ1(ω) vanishes as
¯hω −Eopt at the band threshold and there is
a maximum in σ1(ω) at a frequency ω = (1 + γ)Eopt/¯h,
where γ is a small number.
Field theory predicts the
same behavior with γ ≈0.24 in the weak-coupling limit
while the strong-coupling analysis gives a maximum at
¯hω = U = Eopt + 4t, and thus γ vanishes as t/U for
U ≫t. The distance γEopt between the spectrum thresh-
old and the maximum increases with U/t. For U ≥4t
this distance is large enough to determine the ﬁnite-size
scaling of the lower band edge using systems with up
to N = 256 sites. As an example, Fig. 2(a) shows the
low-energy maximum in the optical spectrum σ1(ω) calculated with DDMRG for U = 4t as a function of η(N).
The contrast between the Mott-Hubbard insulator and
the Peierls insulator is striking and the maximum in the
Mott-Hubbard insulator optical spectrum clearly tends
to a constant for η(N) →0. [For U = 4t the optical
gap of the Hubbard model is comparable to that of the
Peierls insulator with ∆= 0.6t, so that a direct comparison of both systems is relevant.] In Fig. 2(b) one sees
that the ﬁnite-size optical gaps calculated with DDMRG
converge to the exact result14 Eopt = 1.287t in the thermodynamic limit, but the maximum tends to a higher
energy ¯hω ≈1.7t.
Therefore, one can conclude that
there is no divergence at the optical conductivity threshold ¯hω = Eopt. Moreover, it is possible to conﬁrm that
σ1(ω) vanishes as
¯hω −Eopt at the lower band edge using either a similar scaling analysis for the derivative of
DDMRG spectra or a direct comparison with the convolution of functions such as Eq. (32) or the ﬁeld-theoretical
optical spectrum.8
For very weak coupling one would need to calculate
σ1(ω) for very large system sizes in order to perform
the same scaling analysis.
Because Eopt vanishes exponentially with U/t and the scaling analysis must be
performed in the asymptotic regime η(N) < γEopt, the
required system sizes N increases exponentially as t/Eopt
for U/t →0. Fortunately, it is not necessary to carry out
this analysis for the Hubbard model because the optical
conductivity of the weak-coupling ﬁeld theory is already
in excellent agreement with the optical conductivity of
the lattice model for U = 3t.
Strong-coupling limit
In this section I discuss the special case of a Mott-
Peierls insulator (∆̸= 0, U > 0) in the strong-coupling
limit U/t →∞, for which the shape of the optical spectrum is known analytically.15 In this limit there is exactly one electron on each site in the ground state of the
Peierls-Hubbard Hamiltonian (33). An optical excitation
moves one electron from a site to another and thus creates
a double occupation (doublon) and an empty site (holon).
Therefore, the optical gap is of the order of U. These elementary charge excitations are spinless bosons as in the
Hubbard model. The properties of the spin degrees of
freedom are determined by an eﬀective Heisenberg model
with alternating exchange couplings J1 ∼(t + ∆/2)2/U
and J2 ∼(t −∆/2)2/U. The spin gap Es vanishes in
the limit U →∞. However, as there is a gap in the spin
excitation spectrum for any ﬁnite U/t (see also next section), the structure of the spin ground state in the limit
U/t →∞is actually similar to that of a gapped state.
For instance, the antiferromagnetic spin-spin correlations
Reduced optical conductivity Cη[ωσ1(ω)] as a function of ¯hΩ= ¯hω −U in the strong-coupling limit U ≫t for
∆= 0.6t. The solid line is the DDMRG result, Eq. (43), for a
128-site lattice with a broadening η/t = 0.1. The dot-dashed
line is a Lorentzian distribution of width η/t = 0.1 centered
at ¯hω = U. The two dashed lines represent the analytical
result (48) for the continuum of an inﬁnite system (η = 0).
Note the logarithmic scale of the ordinate axis.
decreases exponentially with increasing distance. Thus,
this strong-coupling limit of the Peierls-Hubbard model
is diﬀerent from the two limiting cases discussed previously and from the general case presented in the next
In the thermodynamic limit the optical conductivity
can be calculated analytically using some reasonable assumptions.15 If 0 < |∆| < 2t, the spectrum consists of
two bands for 2|∆| ≤|¯hω −U| ≤2t
σ1(ω) = g0e2a
[(¯hΩ)2 −(2∆)2][(4t)2 −(¯hΩ)2]
where ¯hΩ= ¯hω −U, and a δ-peak at ¯hω = U
σ1(ω) = πgπe2at2
in the middle of the gap 4|∆| separating the bands. For
∆→0 one recovers the optical spectrum of the Hubbard
model in the strong coupling limit, which consists of a
single band and a δ-peak in the middle of this band.8,15
The prefactors g0 and gπ are spin form factors given by
ground-state spin correlation functions. They are functions of the eﬀective exchange coupling ratio J2/J1 and
thus of δ = |∆/2t|. Assuming a dimer spin ground state
(i.e., J1 > 0 and J2 = 0) one obtains g0 = 9/4 and
gπ = 1 + 32δ + 62δ2 + 32δ3 + δ4
This result becomes exact in the dimer limit |∆| = 2t,
where gπ = 8. For ∆→0 the dimer spin ground state
does not give the correct form factors because it is known
exactly that g0 + gπ = 4 ln(2) and it was found numerically that gπ/g0 ≈10−2 (see Ref. 8).
Figure 4 shows the reduced optical conductivity
Cη[ωσ1(ω)] calculated using DDMRG on a 128-site lattice for ∆= 0.6t and η/t = 0.1.
A logarithmic scale
is used to make visible the weak bands on both sides of
the strong central peak. In Fig. 4 one can recognize the
spectral shape predicted by the strong-coupling analysis.
To make a quantitative comparison, however, it is ﬁrst
necessary to determine g0 and gπ using the ﬁnite-size
scaling analysis of Sec. IV. Here I use a size-dependent
broadening η(N)/t = 12.8/N as for the Hubbard model
because the spectral width is also of the order of 8t. For
¯hω = U −2t DDMRG results for Cη[ωσ1(ω)] tend to
0.78 (in units of e2at/¯h2) for N →∞. Comparison with
Eq. (48) then yields g0 ≈2.2.
In Fig. 4 I also show
the two bands (48) with this value of g0 (without broadening). The agreement with the ﬁnite-system DDMRG
spectrum is excellent. The small deviations visible close
to the band edges are due to the diﬀerent broadening used
for the numerical result (η/t = 0.1) and for the analytical result (η = 0). They vanish if the same broadening is
used in both calculations. Once more this conﬁrms that
a broadening satisfying Eq. (26) hides most ﬁnite-size effects in this model as already shown by other examples
in Sec. V A of this paper and in Refs. 8 and 9. In the
DDMRG spectra Cη[ωσ1(ω)] the height of the central
peak diverges as 2.42t/η (in units of e2at/¯h2) for increasing η(N) but its position does not change. This conﬁrms
that it corresponds to a δ-peak at ¯hω = U and gives
an estimate gπ ≈2.42. This δ-peak broadened with a
Lorentzian distribution of width η/t = 0.1 is also shown
in Fig. 4. One sees that the agreement with the DDMRG
result is perfect.
A similar ﬁnite-size scaling was performed to determine the form factor gπ in the Hubbard
One notes the surprisingly good agreement between
the form factors determined numerically with DDMRG
(g0 ≈2.2 and gπ ≈2.42) and those obtained using the
approximation of a dimer spin ground state (g0 = 2.25
and gπ ≈2.52).
For the value ∆= 0.6t used in this
example, the ratio J2/J1 ≈0.29 of the eﬀective exchange
coupling is already quite small and thus the dimer spin
ground state is probably a very good approximation of
the actual spin ground state.
Mott-Peierls insulator
The optical conductivity of the Peierls-Hubbard model
is not known for general interaction parameters U > 0
and 2t > |∆| > 0. In this regime the system is in a Mott-
Peierls insulating phase10: both a periodic lattice potential (i.e., the alternating hopping terms) and electronic
correlations contribute to the formation of a charge gap
Ec > 0 and there is a ﬁnite spin gap Es > 0. Numerical
investigations of the charge and spin gaps and of static
correlation functions reveal no phase transition at ﬁnite

therein). Thus the entire parameter space (0 < U/t < ∞,

0 < |∆| < 2t) belongs to a single Mott-Peierls insulating
phase. Figure 5 shows charge and spin gaps as a function
of U and ∆. These gaps have been calculated on lattices
with up to N = 400 sites using DMRG and extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit. The charge gap of the
Mott-Peierls insulator is always larger than the gap of
the Mott-Hubbard and Peierls insulators in the ∆= 0
and U = 0 limits, respectively. The spin gap is always
smaller than the charge gap in the Mott-Peierls phase.
In the thermodynamic limit the optical gap Eopt is
equal to the charge gap. The nature of the optical excitations in the Mott-Peierls insulator is not well understood. Despite the obvious diﬀerence between charge and
spin excitation energies, Es < Ec, it is not even known
if there is a spin-charge separation for single-particle excitations. Optical excitations could consist of a pair of
fermionic quasi-particles with opposite spins ±σ and opposite charges ±e as in a Peierls insulator (Sec. V A).
They could as well be made of two spinless bosonic excitations carrying opposite charges ±e as in the Mott-
Hubbard insulator (Sec. V B) and in the strong-coupling
limit (Sec. V C).
The investigation of spin and charge gaps and static
correlation functions clearly shows that the three special cases described in the previous sections are singular
limits of the Peierls-Hubbard model. Unsurprisingly, I
have found that the optical conductivity in the Mott-
Reduced optical conductivity Cη[ωσ1(ω)] calculated

¯hΩ= ¯hω −U. Note the logarithmic scale of the ordinate axis.
Peierls phase is unlike the simple spectrum observed in
these limits. [All optical spectra presented in this section
have been calculated using DDMRG and the ﬁnite-size
scaling analysis has always been performed using a sizedependent broadening η(N)/t = 12.8/N.]
For large but ﬁnite U the optical spectrum consists
of three bands: a narrow band with a strong singularity
around ¯hω = U and one weak band on each side of this
central peak. The singularity seems to be made of two
very close power-law divergences which merge to form
the single isolated δ-peak (49) in the U/t →∞limit.
The optical spectrum starts as
¯hω −Eopt at the lower
band edge Eopt for all |∆| < 2t. Figure 6 shows the reduced optical conductivity Cη[ωσ1(ω)] for U = 40t and
∆= 0.6t. The spectrum looks very similar to the spectrum for U/t →∞, which is again shown in this ﬁgure. A
ﬁnite-size-scaling analysis shows however that the strong
central peak is not a δ-function for U = 40t but a narrow band with at least one singularity diverging as η−0.8.
The spectra in Fig. 6 are made of three bands: the gaps
between the bands appear as local minima on both sides
of the central peak because of the relatively large broadening used (η/t = 0.1). The ﬁnite-size scaling analysis
conﬁrms the existence of these gaps. For decreasing parameters U or |∆| ﬁrst the lower gap, then the upper
gap close. Therefore, the number of bands in the optical spectrum of the Mott-Peierls insulator is not constant
but depend on the interaction parameters U and ∆.
The evolution of the optical conductivity as a function
of U is very interesting. For decreasing U/t one observes
that the central peak breaks into two peaks appearing
as local maxima in the broadened spectrum of ﬁnitesize systems. The ﬁrst peak (at the lowest energy) takes
over most of the optical weight of the central peak. Its
weight decreases progressively with decreasing U/t but
remains strong even for small U. In Fig. 7, it is clearly
visible (at ¯hω > 4t) even for U = 2t (with ∆= 0.6t).
This peak corresponds to a power-law divergence within
Optical conductivity σ1(ω) calculated with DDMRG
on a 64-site lattice (η/t = 0.2) for ∆= 0.6t and several values
a band with an exponent that tends to −1/2 for U →0.
The peak position moves to lower energy as U decreases
and reaches ¯hω = 4t for U = 0. Therefore, the central
peak observed at strong coupling U ≫t corresponds to
the upper square-root divergence in the Peierls insulator
spectrum (47). (In Fig. 7 this divergence is barely visible
as a local maximum at ¯hω ≈4t because of the relatively
large broadening η/t = 0.2 used.) The second peak has
very little optical weight (it is not visible in Fig. 7) and
I have not been able to determine its structure.
For U ≫t the optical weight is distributed symmetrically around the central peak, as seen in Fig. 6. As U
decreases, there is a progressive transfer of optical weight
from high frequency (above the central peak) to low frequency (below the central peak), see Fig. 7. The highfrequency spectrum becomes very weak for small U/t but
it completely disappears only at U = 0. It is diﬃcult
to determine the spectral width for general parameters
because the optical conductivity is very weak and vanishes smoothly at high frequency.
I estimate that the
width of the spectrum lies between 4t and 8t for U > 0.
The smallest width is reached for large ∆and small U,
the largest for small ∆and large U. The low-frequency
spectrum becomes stronger as U diminishes. The local
maximum below the central peak (seen in Fig. 6) progressively rises, moves closer to the lower band edge, and
transforms into a strong narrow peak, visible in the spectra shown in Fig. 7 (at ¯hω < 4t). For small enough U/t
this low-energy peak contains more optical weight than
the central peak. For U →0 the low energy peak becomes the square-root divergence of the Peierls insulator
spectrum (47) at the band threshold Eopt.
For U > 0, however, my results suggest that the optical spectrum always vanishes smoothly at the optical
I think that the low-energy optical spectrum of
the Peierls-Hubbard model at weak coupling has a qualitative behavior similar to that of the Hubbard model:
as ¯hω −Eopt decreases, σ1(ω) ﬁrst appears to diverge

as (¯hω −Eopt)−1/2, then goes through a maximum just
above the optical gap Eopt, and vanishes smoothly for
¯hω →Eopt. For large enough U it is possible to carry
out a ﬁnite-size scaling analysis similar to the one performs for the Hubbard model (see Sec. V B).
is possible to check that the low-energy spectrum maximum is ﬁnite and lies at a higher energy than the optical
gap, and to show explicitly that σ1(ω) ∼
¯hω −Eopt for
¯hω −Eopt →0+.
For smaller U it becomes increasingly diﬃcult to distinguish a smooth spectrum with a truncated divergence
from a true divergence.
For instance, Fig. 8 shows
the low-frequency optical conductivity ωCη[σ1(ω)/ω] for
U = 2.3t and ∆= 0.15t with a broadening η/t = 0.1
(N = 128 sites). For comparison, I also show the spectra in two limits discussed previously, the Mott-Hubbard
insulator [σ1(ω) ∼
¯hω −Eopt ] and the Peierls insulator [σ1(ω) ∼1/
¯hω −Eopt ], with similar optical gaps
(Eopt/t = 0.6 −0.7) and the same broadening η. Clearly,
the Mott-Peierls insulator spectrum looks like an intermediate case between the spectra observed in both limiting cases. The position of the maximum in the Mott-
Peierls insulator spectrum tends to 0.78t for η(N) →0
while the charge gap (and optical gap) equals 0.704t in
the thermodynamic limit. Certainly, there is no divergence in the low-energy optical spectrum. However, the
maximum seems to diverge as 1/√η even for the smallest broadening I have used (η/t = 0.05). Thus this spectrum seems to be qualitatively similar to a function such
as Eq. (32), but the maximum is so close to the optical
gap that broadenings η signiﬁcantly smaller than 0.05t
(i.e., system sizes much larger than N = 256) would be
necessary to reach the asymptotic regime as discussed in
Sec. IV. For the same reason it is not possible to deter-

mine how the spectrum vanishes for ¯hω −Eopt →0+ in
such a case
In the Hubbard model it is possible to conﬁrm the
absence of a singularity and the square-root vanishing at
the band threshold even if the optical gap is as small as
Eopt = 0.4t, because we know the optical spectrum of
an inﬁnite system for Eopt →0 from ﬁeld theory.8 The
ﬁeld theory approach does not only apply to the Hubbard
model, but more generally, gives the low-energy optical
spectrum of one-dimensional Mott insulators with small
Mott gaps.9,16 The diﬀerent spectral functions depend
only on an interaction parameter β2 ≤1. In addition,
the optical gap Eopt > 0 and a normalization constant
set the frequency scale and the conductivity scale. For
1/2 < β2 ≤1 these optical spectra described truncated
square-root divergence with a square-root vanishing at
the band threshold as in Eq. (32). For β2 = 1 (Hubbard
model) the spectrum has the shape shown in Fig. 3 with a
maximum at 1.24Eopt. As β2 decreases the peak becomes
sharper and the maximum moves closer to the band edge.
For β2 = 1/2 the optical spectrum is similar to that of
a Peierls band insulator with a square-root divergence at
the band threshold.
Therefore, this ﬁeld theory9,16 can describe the optical spectrum in both limiting cases (Mott-Hubbard
and Peierls insulators) of the Peierls-Hubbard model in
the small gap regime, and the ﬁeld-theoretical spectrum
evolves continuously from one limit to the other with β2
going from 1 to 1/2. Using 1 ≥β2 ≥1/2, the optical
gap Eopt, and the normalization constant as ﬁt parameters, I have compared the low-energy optical conductivity
calculated with DDMRG for small gaps (Eopt < 0.71t)
to ﬁeld-theoretical spectra with similar broadening as
explained in Sec. IV.
For instance, I show in Fig. 9
the DDMRG spectrum for the lattice model (33) with
U = 2.3t and ∆= 0.15t and the ﬁtted ﬁeld-theoretical
spectrum with β2 = 0.58.
Both spectra agrees up to
¯hω = 1.2t ≈1.7Eopt. Generally, I have found that the
optical spectrum of a Mott-Peierls insulator can be ﬁtted by a ﬁeld-theoretical spectrum with β2 > 1/2 over
a ﬁnite frequency range, from ω = 0 to a frequency ω
which lies between the position of the low-energy maximum and 2Eopt/¯h. (Naturally, for U →0 the best ﬁt is
always obtained with β2 = 1/2.) Therefore, I think that
for any U > 0 (and 0 ≤|∆| < 2t) the optical spectrum
vanishes as
¯hω −Eopt for ¯hω −Eopt →0+.
Note that I do not assume that the ﬁeld-theoretical calculations in Refs. 9 and 16 are also valid for the Peierls-
Hubbard model with general interaction parameters. Actually, there are visible discrepancies starting at rather
low energy between ﬁeld theory and DDMRG results for
the lattice model, as shown in Fig. 9. The agreement between ﬁeld theory and DDMRG results in the region of
the band threshold simply means that the optical spectra
in Mott-Peierls insulators and in one-dimensional Mott
insulators have similar shapes just above the optical gap.
Finally, it is interesting to examine the evolution of
the optical spectrum from weak to strong bond alternation for ﬁxed U. It has been shown in Ref. 8 (see also
Sec. V B) that for ∆= 0 (Hubbard model) the spectrum
consists of a single band with a maximum close to the
lower band edge and a tiny peak in the center (at least
for U ≥4t). If |∆| increases one observes in Fig. 10(a)
that the maximum moves closer to the optical gap and
corresponds to a sharper peak.
The optical spectrum
still starts as
¯hω −Eopt at the band threshold as discussed above. The central peak, which is too weak to be
seen in Fig. 10(a) for ∆= 0, becomes rapidly stronger
as |∆| increases and is clearly visible for ∆= 0.4t. As
discussed previously this peak becomes a δ-function in
the strong-coupling limit U ≫t and corresponds to the
upper square-root divergence of the Peierls insulator if U
vanishes. For moderate |∆| the ratio between the hopping integrals r(∆) = (t −|∆|/2)/(t + |∆|/2) is not too
small and the optical weight is mostly concentrated below
the central peak. If this ratio becomes small, however,
the central peak becomes the spectrum dominant feature, see Fig. 10(b). The proportion of the optical weight
which is in the central peak increases as 1 −r2(∆) for
r(∆) →0. A ﬁnite-size scaling analysis conﬁrms however
that this peak is not a δ-function but is still a power-law
divergence within an excitation band. Only in the dimer
limit |∆| = 2t [r(∆) = 0] the optical spectrum is made
of a single δ-peak, which corresponds to the excitation of
Frenkel excitons localized on a dimer.
In summary, the optical spectrum of a Mott-Peierls
insulator consists of one or more bands with a total spectral width ranging from 4t to 8t. The distinctive features
of the spectrum are a square-root vanishing of σ1(ω) at
the lower band edge and a peak due to a power-law singularity around the middle of the spectrum. For strong
couplings [U ≫t and r(|∆|) ≪1] most of the optical
weight is in the central peak, while for weak couplings
[U ≪4t and r(|∆|) > 1/2] it is mostly concentrated in a

narrow peak just above the optical gap. In the limit of
a vanishing gap (U →0 and ∆→0) this narrow peak
becomes a Drude peak at ω = 0. For intermediate couplings most of the optical weight is distributed over a
broad frequency range between the optical gap and the
central peak and σ1(ω) goes through a maximum in this
The central peak always appears at an energy larger
than the bare band width 4t. For parameters which are
realistic for conjugated polymers,10 most of the optical
weight lies below this peak. Therefore, I think that it
is not possible to observe such a structure in the optical
spectrum of conjugated polymers, because it occurs at a
too high energy (> 10 eV) and its intensity is too weak.
The optical spectrum of Mott-Peierls insulators is unlike that of Mott-Hubbard and Peierls insulators. However, most of its main features are found in the strongcoupling limit investigated in Ref. 15 and discussed in
Sec. V C. This suggests that the optical excitations of
a Mott-Peierls insulator could be made of a pair a spinless bosonic excitations with opposite charges as in the
strong-coupling limit (and in a Mott-Hubbard insulator).
Nevertheless, understanding the nature of the system elementary excitations requires the study of additional dynamical properties, such as the one-particle Green’s functions. The DDMRG method will enable us to carry out
this further investigation.
CONCLUSION
In this paper I have presented a dynamical DMRG
method which allows one to calculate the optical conductivity of one-dimensional correlated electron systems
on large lattices with great accuracy. The DDMRG approach to the calculation of dynamical properties is essentially an application of the standard DMRG algorithm
for ground-state calculations. Therefore, both methods
have the same advantages but also the same limitations.
In particular, DDMRG will directly beneﬁt from recent
and future improvements of DMRG such as the use of
additional symmetries.
With DDMRG it is possible to calculate the dynamical response of correlated systems with hundreds of sites
and particles. Relative errors of the order of 10−4 can
be achieved for the optical spectrum of ﬁnite systems
with N ∼102 sites.
Using a ﬁnite-size scaling analysis based on a size-dependent broadening of the discrete
ﬁnite-system spectra, one can then calculate a dynamical
spectrum in the thermodynamic limit with a resolution
of the order of 1% of the spectral width and even investigate singularities in a continuum.
The DDMRG approach can be used for various dynamical quantities, such as dynamical spin-spin correlation
functions or single-particle Green’s functions. It can also
be applied to other lattice quantum many-body models,
in higher dimension, including spin or boson degrees of
freedom, or long-range interactions. The correction vector DMRG method has been used to calculate non-linear
dynamic response functions, such as third-order dynamical polarizabilities.5 Similarly, the variational principle
presented in Sec. II can be generalized to dynamical correlation functions describing these non-linear responses.
Thus I believe that it is possible to develop an eﬃcient
DDMRG method for calculating these quantities. A limitation of the DDMRG approach is the restriction to zero
temperature. It would be desirable to extend the variational principle and the DDMRG approach to ﬁnitetemperature dynamical properties.
The computational resources used by the DDMRG
method are relatively modest. For instance, all calculations presented in this paper were carried out on workstations with a single 500 MHz Alpha processor and required
less than 1 GByte of memory. It would be easy and very
eﬃcient to run DDMRG on a parallel computer as calculations for diﬀerent frequencies are almost independent.
This would permit one to investigate much larger or more
complicated systems than in this work.
In summary, the DDMRG method and the ﬁnite-size
scaling technique for dynamical spectra appear extremely
accurate and versatile.
They provide a powerful approach for investigating the dynamical properties in lowdimensional lattice quantum many-body systems.
Finally, it should be kept in mind that the variational
principle for dynamical correlation functions and their related excited states is completely independent from the
DMRG method. Therefore, it is possible to combine this
principle with other variational methods to calculate dynamical properties. For instance, one could build a trial
wavefunction |ψ({λi})⟩= R({λi})|ψ0⟩, where R({λi}) is
an operator depending on a few parameters λi, such that
the calculation of W({λi}) = WA,η(ω, ψ({λi})) reduces
to the evaluation of ground-state correlation functions.
Then the minimization of W({λi}) with respect to the
variational parameters {λi} would give a lower bound
and an approximate value of the dynamical spectrum
IA(ω + iη).
