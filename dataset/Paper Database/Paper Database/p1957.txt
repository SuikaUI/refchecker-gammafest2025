ABSTRACT In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved as a research ﬁeld that transforms
human lifestyle from traditional to sophisticated. In IoT, the network plays a crucial role in collecting
data from sensors and moving to the sink. Increasing the network lifetime is a challenging task in IoT,
which is connected to devices that are limited by resource. Clustering is one of the effective methods of
increasing the network lifetime. However, improper cluster head (CH) selection easily drains the energy early
in network nodes. With the aim to overcome the issue, this paper proposes the Type-2 Fuzzy Logic-based
Particle Swarm Optimization (T2FL-PSO) algorithm to select the optimal CH to extend the network lifetime.
The T2FL is highly useful in providing the accurate solution in uncertain network environments. Hence,
T2FL is applied on the network parameters, residual energy, and the distance between sensor node and
base station to determine the ﬁtness value. Later, virtual clusters are formed on the basis of distance
between sensor node and CH and between node and base station. To validate the performance of the
proposed T2FL-PSO algorithm, extensive simulations are carried out using MATLAB 2019a. Furthermore,
the proposed T2FL-PSO algorithm is compared with Particle Swarm Optimization Clustering (PSO-C) and
Particle Swarm Optimization Wang Zhang (PSO-WZ). The result conﬁrms that the proposed T2FL-PSO
increases the network lifetime by 10%–15% and the packet transmission ratio by 10%. Compared with
similar algorithms, the proposed T2FL-PSO also causes a higher increase of network lifetime.

I. INTRODUCTION
In the recent era, Internet of Things (IoT) is a new ﬁeld
of study that draws attention of scholars, researchers, and
government agencies , . In IoT, embedded devices are
connected to the Internet, which contains an IP address for
identiﬁcation. In addition, IoT devices can connect with
other devices at anytime and anywhere – . The implementation of IoT technology is based on various technologies, such as cloud computing, wireless sensor networks
(WSN), and embedded systems. IoT applications include

smart technologies in city, grid, farming, hotel, and supply
chain management. The primary aim of IoT is to provide
human beings with a sophisticated life – .
The WSN comprises ﬁxed sensor nodes with small memory, low power, and minimal processing ability. WSNs have
a weak link and short range of wireless communication. Each
sensor has a memory, power and processing unit to sense
the temperature and humidity. The embedded sensor devices
seem to be either linearly or randomly positioned to form
a wireless network for transmitting data from one location
to another. In general, the Base Station (BS) is directly
connected with a power supply and all the sensor nodes are
connected with rechargeable batteries. In this case, extending

the network lifetime plays a signiﬁcant role in WSN. Routing
is one of these methods – .
Routing is a mechanism whereby data is transferred from
the sender to the BS. Routing is categorized into three
types, namely, ﬂat structure-based, hierarchical structure
and location-based routing protocols . The multi-hop
data transmission requires much energy and creates congestion during data transmission between the network nodes.
Moreover, several of the applications such as temperature
and environment monitoring transfers the redundant data
packets to the BS. Therefore, clustering is a good option
to increase the network lifetime to prevent redundant data
transmission – .
Clustering is an effective energy saving technique in a
resource-constrained wireless network. This method offers
the aggregation facility in the cluster, which reduces the
duplicate data from the CM and only the aggregated data are
passed to the BS. In a clustering protocol, the essential processes are cluster creation, cluster head (CH) selection, and
route establishment between nodes and BS – . The
CH selection plays a crucial role in increasing the network
lifetime. Figure. 1 shows the cluster based IoT architecture.
FIGURE 1. Cluster-based IoT Architecture.
CH selection uses various methods, namely, residual
energy, composite metrics, probability basis, rotational basis,
mathematical theories and optimization algorithm. The latter provides promising results when compared with other
techniques , .
The optimization algorithm iteratively executes the procedure until the best option in the solution space is reached.
Optimization algorithms include linear programming, continuous, bound-constrained, discrete, global, derivative-free
and constrained optimization . Linear programming is
one of the most effective techniques for minimization or
maximization problems to obtain the optimal solution in the
solution space. The linear programming-based optimization
algorithms are categorized into meta-heuristics optimization,
multi-objective and multilevel optimization problems. In this,
the meta-heuristics optimization is popular in ﬁnding the best
solution for discrete combinatorial problems. The most popular algorithms in meta-heuristics are Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), simulated
annealing, Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), Tabu Search (TS)
algorithm, and Genetic Algorithm (GA) – . In this
case, the PSO is an effective optimization algorithm for
choosing the CH node within the cluster and balancing the
energy depletion between nodes. Thus, PSO extends the
lifetime of IoT networks batter than other meta-heuristic
algorithms.
This study proposes a T2FL-PSO algorithm to select the
best CH node to extend the network lifetime. The ﬁtness
value of each node is computed by exploring the fuzzy logic
on the Residual Energy (RER) and BS distance. Then, virtual clusters are created based on the distance between the
sensor particle and CH node and the degree of CH. Thus,
the T2FL-PSO meets the network requirements and increases
the overall performance.
The contributions of T2FL-PSO are stated as follows:
• In-depth analysis of CH selection based on various
optimization algorithms to boost network performance
in terms of network lifespan, latency, throughput and
packet transmission ratio.
• Design and development of T2FL-PSO for choosing the
CH in IoT to improve the network lifetime and packet
transmission ratio.
• Extensive simulation is carried out using MATLAB
2019a and the performance of the proposed T2FL-PSO
is compared with recent similar algorithms, namely,
PSO-C and PSO-WZ.
The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. Section 2
discusses related works. Section 3 presents the proposed system model while Section 4 presents the proposed T2FL-PSO
algorithm. Section 5 discusses the result and performance
comparison. Section 6 discusses the analysis. Section 7 concludes the paper with future work.
II. RELATED WORK
In this section, we use optimization algorithms to address
the selection of CH in IoT. In addition, various optimization
algorithm and their uses in clustering protocol are discussed.
Finally, the gaps observed in related works are identiﬁed.
Zhang and Wang proposed a bio-inspired CH selection
in IoT. Sensor nodes are located, and the number of CH nodes
is selected at random regions of the network. The cluster is
created according to the division rule. Each node computes
the ﬁtness function, which is based on energy distribution and
consumption. Each particle obtains the global best (gBest)
and local best (pBest) based on the PSO-WZ algorithm.
The particle positions are updated with respect to velocity.
The velocity position is calculated from the social inﬂuence,
personal inﬂuence, and inertia. The simulation is conducted,
and the performance analysis is evaluated. The result con-
ﬁrms that the PSO-WZ algorithm increases the network lifetime by 5%–10% compared with LEACH, PSO and PSO-C.
VOLUME 9, 2021
S. Sennan et al.: T2FL-PSO Algorithm Used to Maximize the Lifetime of IoT
However, the particle does not obtain the optimal value
due to the consideration of parameter minimization and
maximization.
Behera et al. proposed the remaining energy-based
CH selection in IoT. Choosing the right CH node plays a
pivotal role in IoT load management and in optimizing network lifetime. Initially, the CH nodes are selected randomly.
Later, the maximal remaining energy node acts as CH in
each round. The CH node gathers data from all the cluster
members (CMs) and transfers data to the BS. This type of
work is suitable for smart cities, temperature monitoring and
environmental monitoring. The simulation is carried out and
by comparison, the proposed work increases the lifetime
8%–10% than LEACH. However, transferring data is difﬁcult
when the BS and the CH have large discrepancies.
Kulkarni and Malathi proposed the penguin fuzzy
logic-based ant colony optimization (PF-ACO) for CH selection in WSN. In this algorithm, the ﬁtness value is generated by exploring the various objectives, namely, latency,
remaining energy, network trafﬁc, lifespan and node distance.
The simulation is conducted, and the results show that the
PF-ACO algorithm is superior to ABC, ACO and LEACH.
In addition, the computational time in PF-ACO is 1.5 sec less
than all other existing algorithms. However, PF-ACO takes
longer to measure the ﬁtness function.
Dohare and Singh proposed the PSO-based deterministic energy-efﬁcient clustering (PSODEC) in IoT. This
algorithm selects the CH node from the cluster nodes based
on maximum remaining energy. The nodes are randomly
positioned within the network. The cluster is created using
the K-means algorithm. Later, the PSODEC algorithm is used
to select the CH node in each cluster. The simulation is
conducted and the results conﬁrm that PSODEC algorithm
increases the network lifetime by 10%–15% than LEACH
and DEC. However, the CH node is located far from the BS,
and thus communication is difﬁcult in certain cases.
Aziz et al. proposed a grey wolf-based compressive algorithm (EMCA-CS) for IoT data aggregation. The
EMCA-CS algorithm divides the entire network into hexagonal clusters of equal size. Selected randomly in each cluster,
the CH node gathers the data from all CMs and uses compressive sensing algorithm for data aggregation. The EMCA-CS
algorithm establishes the multi-hop best path between the
CH nodes and BS using the grey wolf optimization (GWO)
algorithm. Finally, the BS uses the GWO and reverse greedy
algorithms to recover the original data sent by the CH nodes.
The efﬁcacy of EMCA-CS algorithm provides better results
in terms of the network lifetime, data error rate and overall
power utilization of network nodes than GWRA, CoSAMP,
OMP, SP and LP.
Reddy and Babu proposed the self-addictiveness
whale optimization (SAWO) algorithm for CH selection in
IoT. Euclidean distance is used to generate the number of
clusters in the networks, and SAWO is used to select the
CH in the cluster. In addition, the ﬁtness function is calculated by utilizing the parameters, namely, latency, energy and
distance. The efﬁcacy of SAWO algorithm is compared with
ABC, GA, PSO, AGSA, GSA and WOA. Compared with
the latter, SAWO algorithm increases the network lifespan by
8%. However, the CH election is not optimal in several cases.
Sindhuja and Selvamani proposed Ant Lion Optimization (ALOP) algorithm for CH selection in IoT to extend
the network lifetime. The focus is mainly on the sink node
coverage problem in the network. Energy decreases while
the security increases. The experimental analysis is carried
out by simulation and the result shows that the proposed
ALOP extends the network lifetime by 80% relative to ABC,
ABC-DB and FF. Thus, the ALOP algorithm improves security during data transmission. However, security may remain
insufﬁcient despite the energy efﬁciency during the transfer
John and Rodrigues proposed a Multi-objective Taylor Crow Optimization (MOTCO) algorithm to select CH
in WSN. MOTCO constructs the network cluster based on
distance between the BS and network nodes. For CH selection, the Crow search algorithm and Taylor series is applied.
The objective function (OF) explores transmission delay, distance, energy and network trafﬁc in each cluster, and then
decides the optimal node as CH in each round. Finally, the
CH nodes gather the information and transfers data to the
BS. The proposed MOTCO algorithm improves the network
lifetime by 10% compared with LEACH, PSO, ABC and
FABC. However, the CH selection increases throughput and
decreases the end-to-end delay.
Daniel and Rao proposed a mutation chemical reaction optimization algorithm based on energy aware clustering (MCRO-ECR) for selecting the best CH in WSN. The
chemical reaction and remaining energy are adopted for CH
selection and cluster creation in the network. The utilization of energy in each node is computed from the following parameters, namely, sink distance, nodes distance in the
cluster, node transmission energy and CH node degree. The
CH node is selected in each round of the network based
on energy consumption. The simulation is conducted extensively, and the result conﬁrms that the proposed MCRP-ECR
algorithm increases the network lifetime by 10% compared
with all other algorithms, namely, LDC, PSO-C and CRO-
ECA. However, the MCRP-ECR creates an additional concurrent problem while selecting the CH node.
Famila et al. proposed an improved artiﬁcial bee
colony optimization (IABCOCT) algorithm in WSN. The
cluster creation considers the ABC algorithm and addition,
which incorporates the parameters such as Cauchy operator
and grenade explosion method. The CH is selected using
onlooker bee and scout bee behaviour, which is considered
the degree of exploitation and of exploration, respectively.
Finally, the CH node passes the data directly to the BS.
The IABCOCT algorithm increases the network lifetime
by 10%–25% compared with HCCHE and CCT. However,
IABCOCT takes more convergence.
Karthick and Palanisamy proposed a CH selection
using krill herd algorithm to prolong the WSN network
VOLUME 9, 2021
S. Sennan et al.: T2FL-PSO Algorithm Used to Maximize the Lifetime of IoT
lifetime. The major limitations are network lifetime, data
redundancy in aggregation and network coverage issues.
To overcome these issues, the authors proposed a krill
herd (KH) optimization algorithm to select the best CH in
the network. The algorithm enhances the network lifetime by
10% and raises the packet transmission ratio by 7% compared
with the LEACH and GE algorithms.
Sert et al. proposed a two-tier distributed fuzzy
logic-based protocol (TTDFP) to improve the efﬁciency of
data aggregation operations in multi-hop WSNs. Hotspots are
addressed using the TTDEP, a routing protocol that adopts
fuzzy logic to transfer the data from CMs to BS. The proposed
TTDFP protocol is compared with similar cluster-based routing protocols. TTDFP improved the packet delivery ratio and
extended the network lifetime but neglect the energy hole
problem to a certain extent.
Sert et al. proposed a multi-objective fuzzy clustering
algorithm (MOFCA) for WSNs to extend the network
lifetime. Problems of early energy drain in the network nodes and hotspots nearer the sink are addressed.
Compared with Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy
(LEACH), Energy-Efﬁcient Uneven Clustering (EEUC) and
Energy Aware Unequal Clustering Fuzzy (EAUCF), MOFCA
increased the lifespan by 8%–11%. However, MOFCA did
not consider the LND metric for CH selection.
From the review of related works, various optimization
algorithms for CH selection protocols in WSN-based IoT are
proposed. The limitations are as follows: difﬁculties to reach
the optimal position due to the minimization and maximization of parameters in the ﬁtness function, several optimization
algorithms take longer to measure the ﬁtness function, lack
of security while transferring the data and additional concurrency problem during the CH selection in the network.
To overcome this issue, this paper proposes the T2FL-PSO
algorithm to select the optimal CH to extend the network
lifetime. The T2FL is highly useful to provide the accurate
solution in uncertain network environments. Hence, T2FL is
applied on the network parameters, residual energy and the
distance between sensor node and base station to determine
the ﬁtness value. Later, virtual clusters are formed based on
the distance between sensor node and CH and between node
and BS. Thus, T2FL-PSO shortens the issues listed above and
increases the network lifetime.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
A. NETWORK MODEL
The network comprises ’N’ nodes that are randomly
deployed. The DODAG root is mounted at the top of the
network. Basically, the nodes should have equal energy.
T2FL-PSO comprises virtual cluster formation, CH selection
and route establishment. Euclidean distance is used to form
the virtual clusters in the network, and the algorithm is used
to ﬁnd the best CH node. The route is calculated on the basis
of the route metrics of the queue usage and the estimated
transmission count. Above Figure. 2 show the T2FL-PSO
network model.
FIGURE 2. T2FL-PSO Network Model.
FIGURE 3. T2FL-PSO Energy Model.
B. ENERGY MODEL
The T2FL-PSO uses the model of the ﬁrst order channel to
consume the node energy. The node’s distance within the
threshold follows the free space energy model (t2 power loss)
or the fading channel model (t4 power loss). Figure. 3 shows
the T2FL-PSO energy model.
The energy consumption of node x transmits p bits of data
to node y in relation to the distance p(x,y) , and its
measurement is given in (1).
ETX (p, t)
= pEelec + mεt(x, y)α
pEelec + p ∈fs q(x, y)2
whereq (x, y) < q0
pEelec + p ∈mp q(x, y)4
whereq(x, y) ≥q0
where εfsq(x, y)2 or q(x, y)4 is energy consumption of the
ampliﬁer unit.

IV. PROPOSED TYPE-2 FUZZY LOGIC BASED PARTICLE
SWARM OPTIMIZATION (T2FL-PSO)
The proposed T2FL-PSO has two phases, namely, CH selection and virtual cluster creation. Firstly, the CH is selected
on the basis of RER and the distance between the BS and
nodes. In addition, the BS executes the T2FL-PSO algorithm
in the BS to select the CH in the network. Secondly, the virtual
cluster is created based on the distance between node and
CH an CH node degree. Each CH gathers and aggregates the
data from all CMs to transfer to the BS. Table 1 presents the
nomenclature of T2FL-PSO.
A. CH SELECTION PHASE
The ultimate goal of the T2FL-PSO is to select the best CH to
extend the network lifetime. In this study, the metrics used are
RER and distance between the BS and nodes. The T2FL-PSO
has four steps, namely, particle initialization, ﬁtness function
computation, velocity and particle position update and ﬁtness
function evaluation.
1) PARTICLE INITIALIZATION
The T2FL-PSO contains a swarm of sensor particlesNsp. The
sensor particle is represented asSPi, where 1 ≤i ≤Nsp.
Each sensor particle has various solutions or positions in the
dimension space D . The ith sensor particle SPi various
position or solution is represented in (4).
SPi = [POSi,1, POSi,2 . . . . . . ..POSi,D]
Each solution or position of the sensor particle POSi,1 has the
coordinate ( xi,1,yi,1,) in the network space and its representation is given in (5).
SPi= [(xi,1,yi,1,),(xi,2,yi,2) . . . . . . ..(xi,D,yi,D,)]
where i denotes the number of sensor particles and D denotes
the solution dimension space.
2) Fitness Function Computation
This function indicates the quality of the sensor particles
and calculates using RER and BS distance. The former is a
maximization property, and the latter is a minimization property. For weight distribution, the average weighted method
cannot be applied and therefore the type-2 fuzzy logic is
applied on the two parameters.
a. BS Distance
This parameter indicates the average distance between the
BS and the sensor particle. The calculation is given in (6).
BSdistance (SPi) =
i=1 dist(SPi, BS)
where SPi indicates the ith value of sensor particle and BS
indicates the BS.
2) RESIDUAL ENERGY
RER is the ratio between the amounts of energy depleted and
total energy in the sensor particle SPi. The calculation is given
RER (SPi) = Edepleted
3) FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM
This method is a type of mapping between the input and output functions. Compared with T1FL, the main characteristic
of T2FL is the more efﬁcient handling of the uncertainties
because of a larger number of parameters and more freedom
degrees. This comprises the fuzziﬁer, defuzziﬁer, inference
engine and rule base . Figure. 4 displays the diagram of
T2FL inference system.
The T1FLmodel is suitable to handle the unknown environment to a certain extent. To strengthen the decision making,
we propose T2FL, which effectively handles uncertain environment . T2FL computes the efﬁcient ﬁtness function to
reach the Gbest position and effectively selects the CH node.
In T2FL, the membership functions comprise the low Inferior
Membership Function (IMF) and high Superior Membership
Function (SMF). Both IMF and SMF can be represented
using T1FL membership function, and their distance is called
Foot of Uncertainty (FOU) – , with value range 0–1.
The T2FL is represented in (8).
T2FL = SMF (T1FL) + FOU
The T2FL process is explained below.

FIGURE 4. T2FL-PSO inference system.
• Fuzziﬁer
Fuzziﬁer is a process by which an exact value is transformed
into a fuzzy value. Residual energy and BS distance are the
fuzzy inputs. In a fuzzy set, the linguistic variable and membership function are important to represent the exact value in
a particular context. The linguistic variable in Fuzzy set contains words or sentences instead of numbers. In T2FL-PSO,
this study considers the triangular and trapezoidal membership function, which evaluates the linguistic variable in the
fuzzy set. Trapezoidal and triangular membership functions
are suitable for real-time operations and their computations
are not complex , and thus are applied to the fuzzy input
and output variables in this study.
The general representation of the triangular membership
function is given in (9).
e1 ≤w ≤f 1
The general representation of the trapezoidal membership
function is given in (10).
e2 ≤w ≤f 2
e2 ≤w ≤f 2
f 2 ≤w ≤g2
Figure. 5 shows the membership function of residual energy.
Low, high and medium are linguistic variables, with the ﬁrst
two as trapezoidal and the last is a triangular membership
function , . In this context, the values of the linguistic
variable set is as follows: The Low variable is 0–.1 while the
High is 0.9–1. Finally, the Medium variable is 0.5. The FOU
The variables close, medium and far are linguistic with
triangular membership with value µ of 0–1. . Figure. 6
FIGURE 5. RER membership function.
FIGURE 6. BS distance membership function.
shows the BS distance membership function. The Low variable value is 0–.1 while the High is 0.9–1. The Medium
variable is 0.5. The FOU is 0.2.
FIGURE 7. Fitness value membership function.
Figure.7 shows the membership of ﬁtness value. The
linguistic variables are Excellent, Awful, Low Good, Bad,
Very good, Low bad and Good. The membership value µ
is between 0–1. For all linguistic variables, the triangular
membership functions are used , .
• Fuzzy Rule Base
This study considers the input and output parameters, namely
RER, BS distance and ﬁtness value to compute the fuzzy
rules. The number of fuzzy rules is determined by the number
of inputs and linguistic variables. Nine total number of rules
are generated from three linguistic variables and two input
fuzzy parameters. The ﬁtness value range is 0–100. The fuzzy
rules are generated using IF-THEN rules and then examined

using the Mamdani model , . Table 2 presents the
fuzzy rules.
• Defuzziﬁer
One of the steps to transform the fuzzy output into exact value
is by defuzziﬁer. The centre of gravity (CoG) is a method used
in defuzziﬁcation, as represented in (11).
where w indicates the defuzziﬁer output and µc(w) indicates
the aggregated membership function.
4) VELOCITY AND PRACTICE POSITION UPDATE
In each iteration t, the sensor particles SPi reach their
own positions, namely, Pbest and Gbest. Each sensor particle
attempts to reach the Gbest, which is obtained by updating the
SPi velocity Veli,d and positions POSi,d in each iteration. The
velocity Veli,d calculation is given in (12).
Veli,d (t) = w × Veli,d (t −1) + c1 × rand1
×(POSPbesti,d −POSi,d (t −1) + c2 × rand2
×(POSGbest −POSi,d (t −1))
where c1 and c2 indicate the accelerate factor, such as constant value, w indicates the inertial weight and rand1 and
rand2 indicate the random values between 0 and 1.
The update of SPi is given in (13).
POSi,d (t) = POSi,d (t −1) + Veli,d (t −1)
5) FITNESS FUNCTION EVALUATION
After each iteration, the sensor particles reach the new positions and the ﬁtness function veriﬁes that the particle reaches
the Gbest. The ﬁtness function evaluation formulas are given
in (14) and (15).
 Fitness (SPi) < Fitness
if (Fitness (SPi) < Fitness (Gbest))
The particular sensor particle SPi that reaches Gbest acts as
a CH for a particular round. The CH selection is given in
Algorithm 1.
Algorithm 1 CH Selection
Input: Set of sensor particles ‘N’
Output: Optimal number CH node

2: Compute the ﬁtness function by applying the fuzzy logic
3: Perform fuzziﬁcation using RER and BS distance

5: Update the particle velocity and its positions.
6: Evaluate the ﬁtness function.
if (Fitness (SPi) < Fitness
if (Fitness (SPi) < Fitness (Gbest))
7: If SP position reaches the Gbest, then
8: Stop the iteration.
9: Otherwise
10: Go back to step 2
B. VIRTUAL CLUSTER FORMATION
The virtual clusters are created on the basis of distances
between the node and BS and between the node and CH.
1) NETWORK PARAMETERS
a: DISTANCE BETWEEN SENSOR NODE AND CH NODE
The consumption of node energy is related to the sensor
distances . Therefore, the distance between sensor SPi
and CH node CHi is calculated using Euclidean distance,
which is given in (16).
dist (SPi, CHi) =
(xj −xi)2 + (yj −yi)2
where (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) indicate the sensor SPi coordinates
and CH node coordinates, respectively.
b: DISTANCE BETWEEN NODES AND BS
This parameter is measured on the basis of Euclidean distance . The distance estimation is given in Eq. (17).
dist (SPi, BS) =
(xi −xj)2 + (yi −yj)2
where (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) indicate the coordinates for sensor
SPi and BS, respectively.

2) OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
The Objective Function (OF) helps to ﬁnd a maximization
or minimization solution. In T2FL-PSO, the parameters, distance between SP and CH and distance between SP and BS
are considered as minimization property. Therefore, the average weighted method can be used for both parameters in
the OF for creating the virtual cluster. The simulation is
carried out several times. Weight values range from 0–1. The
performance of T2FL-PSO obtains better results than PSO-C
and PSO-WZ, where w1 and w2 are 0.7 and 0.3, respectively.
The objective function is given in (18).
OF (dist (SPi, CHi) , dist (SPi, BS)) = w1
× dist (SPi, CHi) + w2 × dist (SPi, BS)
where w1 and w2 are weight values for the parameters.
The virtual cluster formation is given in Algorithm 2.

The time complexity of the PSO algorithm is O(n2) to
select the optimal CH in the network nodes. For T2fL,
the time complexity is O(n4). Therefore, the time complexity
of the proposed T2FL-PSO is O(n2 + n4) ≈O(n4). Figure. 8
shows the overall workﬂow of the T2FL-PSO protocol.

number is set to 5. In addition, BS is found in three different

A. NETWORK LIFETIME
The network lifetime indicates how long the nodes are live
and can perform transmission and reception operations. The
simulation is performed nearly 100 times and the average
number of live nodes over time is observed. The simulation
is carried out in three scenarios with respect to the BS location. The efﬁciency of T2FL-PSO is compared with those
of PSO-WZ and PSO-C. Figure. 9 shows the number of live

nodes related to the number of network rounds. In Scenario-1,
the BS is located at (50, 50). Initially, all nodes in the network
are live. As the network round increases, the number of live
nodes gradually decreases.
For the 400th round, the number of live nodes in PSO-C,
PSO-WZ and T2FL-PSO are 0, 2 and 5, respectively. In addition, the number of live nodes is high. The result conﬁrms that
the proposed T2FL-PSO extends the network lifetime more
than PSO-C and PSO-WZ due to the consideration of fuzzy
logic applied in calculating the ﬁtness function.

Table 4 indicates the number of live nodes in PSO-C, PSO-
WZ and T2FL-PSO at varying numbers of rounds. The BS is
located at (50 m, 50 m). The proposed T2FL-PSO increases
the lifetime more than the other protocols, mainly due to the
BS located at the centre of the network.
Figure.10 depicts the number of live nodes related to the
number of rounds. In Scenario 2, the BS is located at (0, 50).
As the number of rounds increases, the number of live nodes
gradually decreases. For the 350th round, all the nodes are
dying in PSO-WZ and PSO-C but not in T2FL-PSO, with live

nodes of 0, 0 and 5, respectively. For each round, the number of live nodes in T2FL-PSO is higher than in the other
algorithms. The result conﬁrms that the proposed T2FL-PSO
extends the network lifetime more than PSO-C and PSO-WZ.
Thus, T2FL-PSO provides better network stability during
data transmission.

Table 5 indicates the number of live nodes in PSO-C,
PSO-WZ and T2FL-PSO at varying number of rounds. The
BS is located at (0 m, 50 m). The proposed T2FL-PSO
increases the lifetime more than the other protocols.
Figure.11 depicts the number of live nodes related to
the number of rounds. In Scenario 3, the BS is located at
(50, 155). As the number of rounds increases, the number
of live nodes gradually decreases. For the 300th round, all
the nodes are dying in PSO-WZ and PSO-C but not in
T2FL-PSO, with live nodes of 0, 0 and 10, respectively.
For each round, the number of live nodes in T2FL-PSO is
higher than in the other algorithms. The result conﬁrms that
the proposed T2FL-PSO extends the network lifetime more
than PSO-C and PSO-WZ. Thus, T2FL-PSO provides better
network stability during data transmission.

The BS is located at (50 m, 155 m). The proposed T2FL-PSO

the nodes deplete their energy early at this BS location.

B. NUMBER OF DATA PACKETS RECEIVED AT BS
Figure. 12 illustrates the number of packets obtained by BS
located at (50, 50) from the sensor nodes in relation to the
number of network rounds. Until the 50th round in Scenario 1,
PSO-WZ, T2FL-PSO and PSO-C collect an equal number of
data packets at BS.
The number of live nodes in all three algorithms has a small
deviation from the number of network rounds. However,
the number of packets received at BS shows major variations in all three algorithms. Note that for the 400th round,
the number of packets received at BS in PSO-C, PSO-WZ and
T2FL-PSO are 2.9 × 108, 3.7 × 108 and 3.8 × 108, respectively. The result conﬁrms that the proposed T2FL-PSO
algorithm increases the packet delivery when the number of
network rounds increases due to the fuzzy concept appropriately applied on the weight values in the parameters RER and
BS distance.
TABLE 7. Number of live nodes with BS at (50, 50).
Table 7 shows the number of data packets that BS receives
using PSO-C, PSO-WZ and T2FL-PSO for varying number
of rounds. In scenario1, the BS is located at (50 m, 50 m).
Note that the proposed T2FL-PSO protocol transmits more
packets than PSO-C and PSO-WZ. The reason is that the BS
is located at the centre of the network.

In Scenario 2, the number of live nodes in all three
algorithms is a minor deviation from the number of rounds.
However, the number of packets received at BS shows major
variations in all three algorithms. For the 400th round,
the number of packets received at BS in PSO-C, PSO-WZ and
T2FL-PSO are 2.6 × 108, 2.7 × 108 and 3.2 × 108, respectively. The result conﬁrms that the proposed T2FL-PSO algorithm increases the packet delivery as the number of network
rounds increases. Scenario 2 receives less number of packets
at BS, which is at the centre of the network, compared with
Scenario 1. Hence, the nodes die in the earlier rounds.
TABLE 8. Number of packets received by BS at (0, 50).
Table 8 shows the number of data packets that BS receives
using PSO-C, PSO-WZ and T2FL-PSO at varyin number
of rounds. The BS is located at (0 m, 50 m). Note that the
proposed T2FL-PSO protocol transmits more packets than
PSO-C and PSO-WZ.
FIGURE 14. Number of packets received at BS vs. number of rounds [BS
location at (50,155)].
Figure. 14 represents the number of packets received by BS
in relation to the number of network rounds. In scenario 3,
the BS is located at (50,150) in Scenario 2. The number
of live nodes in all three algorithms is a slight deviation
from the number of rounds. However, the number of packets
received at BS shows major variations in all three algorithms.
For the 400th round, the number of packets received at BS in
PSO-C, PSO-WZ and T2FL-PSO are 2.4 × 108, 2.9 × 108
and 3.0 × 108, respectively. The experiment result conﬁrms
that the proposed T2FL-PSO algorithm increases the packet
delivery as the number of network round increases. Scenario 3
receives less number of packets at BS compared with Scenarios 1 and 2 due to the positioning of the BS outside the
network. Hence, majority of the nodes dies in the earlier
TABLE 9. Number of packets received the BS at (50, 155).
Table 9 shows that BS receives the number of data packets using PSO-C, PSO-WZ and T2FL-PSO for varying the
number of rounds. In Scenario 3, the BS is located at (50 m,
155 m). Note that the proposed T2FL-PSO protocol transmits a greater number of packets compared with PSO-C and
VI. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
From the simulation results, the data analysis shows that the
proposed T2FL-PSO is more efﬁcient in terms of network
lifetime and packet transmission ratio. The simulation is carried out in different scenarios. In this case, the BS is placed
in different locations, such as (0, 50), (50, 50) (50, 155).
The BS placement plays a signiﬁcant role in data collection
and network performances. From these scenarios, the BS
located at the centre point of the network is more effective in
terms of the number of live nodes and the number of packets
received. Furthermore, the T2FL-PSO algorithm is executed
in BS and plays a crucial role in ﬁnding the optimal CH
between network nodes. As a result, the T2FL-PSO algorithm
improves the network efﬁciency, that is, the network lifetime
and packet transmission ratio.
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Energy conservation is a difﬁcult challenge in IoT given its
connection to resource limited devices. Clustering is one of
the popular methods of saving the network lifetime. However,
improper CH selection easily drains the energy in the network
nodes. Thus, this paper proposes a T2FL-PSO algorithm to
determine the best CH to maximize the network lifetime.
T2FL is applied on the network parameters, RER and distance

between sensor and BS, to determine the ﬁtness value. Later,
virtual clusters are created on the basis of distance between
the node and BS and between node and CH. The simulation
is carried out in MATLAB 2019a. The T2FL-PSO algorithm
is simulated extensively in different network scenarios. with
BS located in different locations, such as (0, 50), (50, 50)
(50, 155). Among the three scenarios, BS that is located at
the centre point of the network is more effective in terms of
the number of live nodes and of packets received at BS. The
result conﬁrms that the proposed T2FL-PSO increases the
network lifetime by 10%–15% and the packet transmission
ratio by 10%. Therefore, the proposed T2FL-PSO increases
the overall network performance.
In future work, we hope to extend the T2FL-PSO in terms
of security, enhance the network lifetime and real-time implementation. Security is a major concern to defend against all
kinds of attacks, such as denial of service, wormhole, black
hole and gray hole. In addition, PSO can be combined with
another algorithm to achieve rapid convergence to increase
the network lifetime. In addition, plans to implement and test
the T2FL-PSO algorithm in real scenarios are underway.
