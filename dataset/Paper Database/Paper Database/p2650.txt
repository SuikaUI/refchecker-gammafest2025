ABSTRACT Lung cancer (LC) is one of the most serious cancers threatening human health. Histopathological examination is the gold standard for qualitative and clinical staging of lung tumors. However,
the process for doctors to examine thousands of histopathological images is very cumbersome, especially
for doctors with less experience. Therefore, objective pathological diagnosis results can effectively help
doctors choose the most appropriate treatment mode, thereby improving the survival rate of patients. For
the current problem of incomplete experimental subjects in the computer-aided diagnosis of lung cancer
subtypes, this study included relatively rare lung adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) samples for the ﬁrst
time, and proposed a computer-aided diagnosis method based on histopathological images of ASC, lung
squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Firstly, the multidimensional
features of 121 LC histopathological images were extracted, and then the relevant features (Relief) algorithm
was used for feature selection. The support vector machines (SVMs) classiﬁer was used to classify LC
subtypes, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were used
to make it more intuitive evaluate the generalization ability of the classiﬁer. Finally, through a horizontal
comparison with a variety of mainstream classiﬁcation models, experiments show that the classiﬁcation
effect achieved by the Relief-SVM model is the best. The LUSC-ASC classiﬁcation accuracy was 73.91%,
the LUSC-SCLC classiﬁcation accuracy was 83.91% and the ASC-SCLC classiﬁcation accuracy was
73.67%. Our experimental results verify the potential of the auxiliary diagnosis model constructed by
machine learning (ML) in the diagnosis of LC.

I. INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer (LC) is one of the most common malignant
tumors worldwide – . According to the 2018 International Agency for Research on Cancer statistics, there will be
2.1 million new cases of LC and 1.8 million deaths worldwide . Due to its high morbidity and mortality, it has
become one of the most serious cancers threatening human
health. Clinicians’ visual analysis of LC histopathological

images is one of the most important methods for evaluating
LC subtypes . However, it is complicated and challenging for pathologists to review thousands of histopathological
images, and it is even more difﬁcult for doctors with less
experience . Therefore, to relieve the pressure on doctors
and improve the accuracy and efﬁciency of diagnosis, it is
particularly important to study the computer-aided diagnosis
model of LC .
From the perspective of pathology and treatment, LC can
be divided into non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and
small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), of which 80%-85% are

NSCLC and the rest are SCLC . The main histological types of NSCLC are lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and
lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). The other histological types of NSCLC are lung adenosquamous carcinoma
(ASC), large-cell carcinoma . In particular, ASC is a relatively rare subtype of NSCLC that accounts for 0.3–5%
of all NSCLCs . Due to the different histopathological
types of LC, the treatment methods adopted are also different. When the lung tissue classiﬁcation is determined,
the appropriate treatment mode can be selected, such as
the reasonable application of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, molecular targeted therapy and immune therapy.
In addition, LC screening errors can be avoided, clinicians’
multifarious work pressure can be slowed, patients’ survival
time can be maximized and the patient’s quality of life
The LC imaging examination methods mainly include:
(1) X-ray photography, which is one of the most basic lung
imaging examination methods, but the resolution of the photography is low and there are blind spots in the examination . (2) Computed tomography (CT), speciﬁcally, chest
CT has advantages in detecting early peripheral LC and
identifying the location of the lesion. Currently, it is one of
the most commonly used imaging methods for preoperative
diagnosis and staging of LC . However, one of the limitations of using CT examinations is that for patients undergoing repeated examinations, it is necessary to consider the
impact of the radiation dose produced by the operation .
(3) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has high sensitivity
and speciﬁcity for vertebral and bone metastases, but it is
not recommended for routine diagnosis of LC , .
(4) Ultrasound is a non-invasive tool, which is usually
superior to radiography in the examination of postoperative
pulmonary complications (PPCs). It has developed into a
valuable method . Although the above imaging examination methods play an important role in detecting of LC,
the results of each examination are only used as a reference
for the diagnosis, staging, re-staging, efﬁcacy monitoring and
prognosis evaluation of LC, while histopathological examination is the gold standard for tumor qualitative and clinical
staging , .
histopathological images, as far as the authors know, there
is no computer-aided diagnosis method for ASC, LUSC
and SCLC based on histopathological images. To ﬁll this
gap, this paper includes ASC sample data for the ﬁrst
time and introduces a computer-aided model for automatic
classiﬁcation of LC subtypes based on histopathological
images of LC. First, seven texture analysis methods are
used to extract 265-dimensional features of LC histopathological images, and the relevant features (Relief) algorithm
is used for feature selection. Compared with a variety of
machine learning (ML) models, the Relief-SVM model
obtains optimal performance for LC subtype classiﬁcation . The main contributions of this study are as
• This study was the ﬁrst to include relatively rare ASCs
in lung histopathological images and applies them to the
automatic classiﬁcation of LC subtypes.
• This paper was the ﬁrst to apply the Relief-SVM
algorithm to the classiﬁcation of LC histopathological
images, which demonstrates the tremendous potential
of ML algorithms to be used in the diagnosis of LC

sections, we will introduce them in detail.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. DATA COLLECTION
This study included 94 patients from a Cancer Hospital in
Xinjiang from October 2011 to October 2020, of whom

each category were selected for display in this study, of which A was

22 had LUSC, 27 had ASC and 45 had SCLC. All subjects
had signed informed consent in this retrospective study. For
improving the generalization performance of the model, this
study took an average of 1-2 pathological tissue sections
from each patient as the research object, and ﬁnally selected
121 histopathological images , . According to the
classiﬁcation standards provided by the World Health Organization, LC patients were collected from the hospital pathology database, and the relevant pathological diagnosis results
were conﬁrmed by pathology. The detailed information is
shown in Table 1. All tumor tissues included in the study
were made into histopathological sections by hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining , which were collected through
the microscope of the hospital pathology department and
stored as JPG image ﬁles with four resolutions: 744 × 554,
2048 × 1536, 1024 × 768, 640 × 480 .

B. HISTOPATHOLOGICAL IMAGE PREPROCESSING
Histopathological examination is the gold standard for qualitative and clinical tumor staging . Histopathological
images have been widely used by doctors for diagnosis and
treatment, and are an important basis for predicting patient
survival . The histopathological images of LUSC, ASC
and SCLC are shown in Figure 2. According to reports,
the following problems exist in histopathological images:
histopathological
large number of rich geometric structures and complex textures caused by the diversity of structural
morphology .
• The histopathological images are easily affected by
color differentiation and noise due to external reasons
such as illumination conditions .
• Due to the difference in microscope magniﬁcation,
equipment parameters and other factors in histopathological images, the image size and resolution are not the
microvessels
histopathological images are the key to disease diagnosis, and the extraction of features is of great signiﬁcance
to assist in the diagnosis and classiﬁcation of LC .
For all these reasons, the histopathological images presented to us are often not perfect. As an efﬁcient low-pass
ﬁlter, the Gaussian ﬁlter has shown good ﬁltering performance in both the spatial domain and frequency domain,
and is widely used in image processing to reduce noise .
Generally, the pixel value of each point is replaced by the
weighted mean of its neighbourhood, so Gaussian ﬁltering
is the process of weighted averaging of the whole image.
The histopathological images processed by Gaussian ﬁltering tend to be smoother and contain less noise, which is
ready for our subsequent studies . According to the
Ciompi et al. description, the existence of differences such
as color destandardization in histopathological images will
limit the interpretation of histopathological images by inexperienced pathologists, and the color differences will affect the
performance of the automatic diagnosis model . To avoid
the problem of information loss due to excessive brightness
of histopathological images , we adopt the adaptive histogram equalization algorithm (AHE) to normalize the color
of histopathological images in this study . In this mode,
the image is divided into several 8×8 pieces, and then the histograms of multiple local regions of the image segmentation
are calculated. At this point, the brightness is redistributed in
the 8 × 8 area to change the image contrast. Therefore, this
algorithm is more beneﬁcial for improving the local contrast
of the image and obtain more image details . According
to the investigation, the improvement in model classiﬁcation
performance by the color normalization method is limited.
The image after the above image preprocessing operation is
shown in Figure 2(b). Figure 3 shows the details before and
after the preprocessing operation of the ASC histopathological image.
C. FEATURE EXTRACTION OF HISTOPATHOLOGICAL
IMAGES OF LUNG CANCER
Because the rich features presented in histopathological
images are an important basis for clinicians to carry out
diagnosis, the effective extraction of image features is the key
to improving the accuracy of computer-aided diagnosis .

This paper explores the effect of two feature extraction methods on LC histopathological image classiﬁcation.
1) HANDCRAFTED TEXTURE EXTRACTION METHODS
We extracted 265-dimensional features using seven handcrafted texture extraction algorithms, including the Hu invariant moments, GLGCM, wavelet transform, GLCM, LBP,
GLDS and Markov random ﬁeld, as shown in Table 2 .
TABLE 2. Extracted features of the seven methods.
The LBP method for texture feature extraction was proposed
in 1994 . However, the greatest defect of the traditional
LBP algorithm cannot satisfy the requirement of textures of
different sizes and frequencies. It only covers a small area
within a ﬁxed radius, which makes it impossible to extract
the features of the whole histopathological image perfectly.
To compensate make up for this deﬁciency, and to meet
the requirements of a constant grey level and rotation, this
paper uses a circular neighbourhood to replace the traditional square neighbourhood LBP algorithm . The LBP
algorithm has the advantages of simple calculation, efﬁcient
recognition, good texture feature display and low computational complexity , .
As the traditional LBP algorithm cannot efﬁciently extract
the texture features from the large-scale image structure,
the improved LBP operator in the circular domain is adopted
in this study to allow the existence of N pixels in the circular
domain with a radius of R. Using the above theory, LBP
feature processing was performed on the histopathological

FIGURE 5. Histogram of gray statistics of histopathological images.

images, and the results are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5.
As seen from Figure 4 and Figure 5, when R = 1 and
N = 8 schemes and R = 2 and N = 8 schemes, the grey
values of the LBP algorithm are mostly concentrated in the
0-100 threshold range. The grey values distribution of the
R = 2 and N = 16 schemes was relatively uniform. However,
the experiments showed that the extracted 59-dimensional
features were more helpful in distinguishing histopathological images of LC when R = 2 and N = 8, while the extracted
features had more redundant information when R = 2 and
N = 16, which was not conducive to the improvement of the
subsequent classiﬁcation effect.
GLCM is a regular method for describing the texture features by studying the spatial correlation characteristics of
grey images. Calculating the joint probability density of
two pixels positions to generate the co-occurrence matrix,
the co-occurrence matrix is statistical second-order statistical

characteristics of image brightness changes; it not only
reﬂects the characteristics of the distribution of brightness,
it also reﬂects the same or close to the brightness of the pixel
brightness between the location of the distribution characteristics, thus constituting a set of texture features to better show
the image features , . However, due to the existence
of a large number of co-occurrence matrices, it is generally
not used directly in the ﬁeld of image processing. Instead,
texture feature quantities are extracted again according to
the grey co-occurrence matrices. The commonly used local
steady characteristic is the energy E, entropy H, moment of
inertia of I, and correlation C. Thus, this study will consider these four with the mean and standard deviation for
subsequent image recognition and the classiﬁcation statistic
formula (such as (1)-(4)), and three points in the lung cancer
model experiment on the image to extract the characteristics
of the above four mean (MN) and standard deviation (SD) as
shown in Figure 6.
Energy : E (d, θ)
i,j {p (i, j | d, θ)}2
Entropy : H (d, θ)

i,j {i, j}2 p (i, j | d, θ)
Correlation : C (d, θ)
i,j (i −µi)
p (i, j | d, θ)
The grey-gradient co-occurrence matrix synthesizes the grey
level and gradient information existing in the image; that
is, the image gradient information is added to the greylevel co-occurrence matrix so that the gradient information is
mixed in the grey-level co-occurrence matrix and the image
feature extraction effect is often better , . Based on the
standardization of the grey-gradient co-occurrence matrix,
we can calculate a series of secondary statistical characteristics. Fifteen is adopted in this study for the commonly
used digital features: small grads dominance, big grads dominance, gray asymmetry, grads asymmetry, energy, gray mean,
grads mean, gray variance, grads variance, correlation, gray

entropy, grads entropy, entropy, inertia, differ moment. After
processing the GLGCM on lung cancer histopathological
images, ﬁfteen features were extracted from each type of
sample and are displayed in Figure 7.
d: OTHER HANDCRAFTED TEXTURE EXTRACTION METHODS
The moment feature mainly expresses the geometric features
in the image area. It has invariant characteristics such as
rotation, translation, and scale, and is often called an invariant moment , . The moment invariant function has
been widely used in image pattern recognition, classiﬁcation,
target recognition and other tasks. Therefore, this paper uses
Hu invariant moments for the feature representation of lung
cancer histopathological images. The seven features of torque
change describe the shape features in the tissue images .
The gray difference statistical method is one of the detection
methods based on statistical texture features . It describes
the gray level changes between each pixel of the texture
image and its neighboring pixels. The method is simple and
easy to implement. In addition, texture feature extraction
methods such as Markov random ﬁeld and wavelet transform
are becoming more and more active in the ﬁeld of pattern
recognition – .
2) CNN AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTS HISTOPATHOLOGICAL
IMAGE FEATURES OF LUNG CANCER
CNNs have gradually developed into one of the mainstream
algorithms in the ﬁeld of computer vision after decades of
development , . The back-propagation strategy proposed by LeCun et al. in 1990 has always been regarded as
the origin of CNN . With the AlexNet network structure
proposed by Krizhevsky et al., the AlexNet structure that
focuses more on details and complexity and has better performance stands out . It won the 2012 ImageNet competition champion and made a major breakthrough in the image
recognition task, which had a strong impact on the ﬁeld of

setting (LUSC-ASC).
computer vision at that time. With the gradual improvement
of people’s matching structure, CNN has been applied to
different ﬁelds of human life – , with remarkable
effects in image classiﬁcation, target detection, face recognition, natural language processing and other related ﬁelds .
To date, the modern CNN architecture mainly consists of the
following ﬁve parts: the convolution layer, the pooling layer,
the activation function, the dropout rate (optional) and the full
connection layer.
CNN’s feature extraction process and the doctor’s diagnosis have a certain similarity, and those closer to the bottom of
the layers in the convolution-based coding tend to learn more
general features and the extracted features can be partial,
with high generality characteristic ﬁgures and edges, such as
visual features (such as color and texture), and those closer to
the top of the layer are more abstract with more specialized
characteristics. In Figure 8, this study shows the layered features extracted from lung cancer pathological tissue images
using VGG16 pairs to verify the reusability of the underlying
features .
FIGURE 10. Cross-validated MSE of LASSO fit (LUSC-ASC).
D. FEATURE SELECTION, FEATURE DIMENSION
REDUCTION AND FUSION
The 265-dimensional features were fused together by serial
fusion. Problems such as the dimensionality disaster caused
by too many sample attributes will adversely affect the
performance of the model . Therefore, it is extremely
important to retain key features and eliminate irrelevant
features. Feature selection often reduces the difﬁculty of
learning tasks and is more conducive to improving operating efﬁciency . Relief is a well-known ﬁltering feature selection method. This method designs a ‘‘correlation
statistic’’ to measure the importance of features. The LASSO

algorithm is more conducive to reducing the risk of over-
ﬁtting and obtaining a ‘‘sparse’’ solution – . Therefore, this study compared the no feature selection, LASSO
feature selection, the relief feature selection model performance and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) feature
dimension reduction , . Through a contrast experiment, we chose the relief feature selection. The relief feature
selection diagram was shown in Figure 9. Figure 10 shows
the LASSO feature selection algorithm using 10-fold cross
validation. The Lasso algorithm formula was shown in
equation 5.
E. CLASSIFIER DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
Support vector machines (SVMs) have gradually developed
into the mainstream technology of machine learning and have
been widely used in every ﬁeld of life . The basic SVM
model is often deﬁned as ﬁnding the hyperplane with the
largest interval that is most suitable for the classiﬁcation of
samples in the feature space, which makes the constructed
linear classiﬁer have stronger generalization performance.
Based on the investigation, it was found that the kernel
function can better map low-dimensional feature data to
high-dimensional data, and the kernel function applied in
different ﬁelds is not the same. To make features more easily separated or better structured, we carried out a detailed
experimental comparison of four kernel functions and the
three optimization algorithms in the following experiments
to make the SVM learner achieve the optimal classiﬁcation
effect , .
In addition, we also conducted parallel comparisons
with the Back Propagation (BP) Neural Network Classi-
ﬁers and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision tree ,

ﬁcation model.
F. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
For the purpose of evaluating the reliability of the model,
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn
to evaluate the effect of the classiﬁcation model, and the
area under the curve (AUC) value was quantitatively displayed . According to their true category and learners’
predicted category, the samples were divided into the following four conditions: true positive (TP), true negative (TN),
false negative (FN) and false positive (FP). The vertical axis
of the ROC curve represents the true positive rate (TPR)
and the horizontal axis of the ROC curve represents the
false positive rate (FPR), deﬁned as Equations (6) and (7),
respectively.
III. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
The experiment in this study was based on the PyCharm
platform and MATLAB R2016a platform , . The
LIBSVM toolbox was used for statistical analysis of the
SVM algorithm . All deep learning experiments were
implemented in the KERAS deep learning framework based
on the TensorFlow 2.0.0 model by using the Python3.6 programming language , . Handcrafted texture extraction methods and SVM support vector machine classiﬁcation
were deployed in MATLAB R2016a platform. The experiments in Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 were repeated ten times, and the
average value was used as the experimental result.
A. SELECTION OF THE FEATURE SELECTION METHOD,
KERNEL FUNCTION AND OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM
In this study, no feature selection, LASSO feature selection, Relief feature selection and LDA feature dimension
reduction were compared, and four kernel functions and three
optimization algorithms were used to attempt to construct
the best auxiliary diagnostic model. The three optimization
algorithms include grid search-SVM (GS-SVM), particle
swarm optimization-SVM (PSO-SVM), and genetic algorithms based on SVM (GA-SVM). The experimental results
are shown in Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6. The experimental parameters are shown in Table 7 . According to the comparison
of experimental results, the optimal combination of the Relief
feature selection, particle swarm optimization algorithm and
polynomial kernel was ﬁnally selected in this study for the
subsequent classiﬁcation and diagnosis of LUSC, ASC and
B. COMPARISON OF THE CLASSIFICATION EFFECT OF LC
HISTOPATHOLOGICAL IMAGES WITH OTHER MODELS
1) COMPARISON WITH OTHER CLASSIFIERS
In this study, several mainstream classiﬁcation algorithms,
such as the NB classiﬁer and KNN classiﬁer, were compared
with the Relief-SVM model. As seen in Table 8, the Relief-
SVM model used in this paper can achieve an overall accuracy of more than 70%, and the classiﬁcation accuracy of
LUSC-SCLC achieved 83.91%. This is a satisfactory result,
which can help the application of cytology in the diagnosis of lung cancer. In addition, the classiﬁcation accuracy
achieved by the Relief-SVM model is 27.39% higher than
the NB model in LUSC-SCLC and 24.34% higher than
the SVM model. We drew the ROC curves of the Decision Tree, BP, KNN, SVM, LASSO-SVM, RELIEF-SVM,

LDA-SVM and NB as shown in Table 9 and the AUC
values are shown in Table 10. As seen in Table 10, the
AUC value of Relief-SVM for LUSC-SCLC classiﬁcation
increased by 0.3625 compared with BP and 0.3250 compared
with LASSO-SVM, and the AUC value of Relief-SVM for
LUSC-ASC classiﬁcation increased by 0.2208 compared
with KNN. The results show that Relief-SVM has good
feasibility.
2) COMPARISON WITH CNN
To make our model robust to feature transformation, ﬁrstly,
the individual data set is randomly divided into 70% for training and 30% for veriﬁcation. Then, the method of ﬂipping,
translation, and multiangle rotation was used to expand the
original data for 100 times respectively – . Table 11
shows the number of images in the augmented training set
and validation set. Inspired by the researchers – ,
we trained the CNNs model, ﬁne-tuning the pre-trained
CNNs model, and custom the CNNs model to conduct experiments on the data set after data augmentation , .
The custom model architecture were shown in Fig 11.
The main experimental parameters of ﬁne-tuning the
pre-trained CNNs are shown in Table 12 , .
Figures 12, 13, 14, and 15 respectively show the accuracy
and loss rate curves under different experimental backgrounds. It can be seen from Figures 12 and 13 that the
accuracy and loss curves of the four classic CNNs have large
ﬂuctuations. Under the guidance of Liu et al. , although
there are large differences between the natural images contained in the ImageNet and medical images, according to the
survey, ﬁne-tuning pre-trained CNNs models can reduce the
problem of the limited number of samples to a certain extent,
and obtain good classiﬁcation performance. We adjust the
model by adding dropout, l2 regularization in the experiment,
using different optimization algorithms, and adjusting the
learning rate, we show in Figure 16, 17 and 18 the change
in the accuracy of the veriﬁcation set under different combinations of dropout rates and learning rates. But the effect
of ﬁne-tuning the pre-trained CNN model is still very poor.
In addition, we also customize the CNN model to classify

lung cancer subtypes, and the experimental results are still not
ideal. Therefore, when the availability of the original medical
data set is limited, the input information still comes from
a small number of original images, so the input information
is still highly relevant. We cannot generate new information,
but can only mix existing information, and cannot completely
eliminate the impact of overﬁtting. The trained CNNs model,
ﬁne-tuning pre-trained CNNs structure, and custom model
show poor classiﬁcation performance when facing a small
number of medical images , . On the contrary, the
classiﬁcation effect of Relief-SVM model is better, which is
more meets our expected effect.
IV. DISCUSSIONS
Histopathological examination is the gold standard for qualitative and clinical staging of lung tumors. Based on the
local microvascular morphology, nucleus and cytoplasm on
the histopathological images, doctors can diagnose tumor
lesions. But for inexperienced or less experienced doctors, this is still a very difﬁcult task. This study uses
traditional feature extraction methods, trained CNNs, ﬁnetuning pre-trained CNNs models, and custom models to
divide lung histopathological images into LUSC, ASC
Firstly, we extracted 265-dimensional features using seven
handcrafted texture extraction algorithms, selected LDA feature dimensionality reduction algorithm, Relief and LASSO
feature selection algorithms, and used a variety of mainstream classiﬁcation algorithms for horizontal comparison,
which proved that the Releif-SVM model has the best classiﬁcation performance. The above algorithms all have their
own advantages, but the LDA algorithm is more suitable for
data with Gaussian distribution, so the performance of LDA-
SVM in this research is poor – . We also selected
four typical CNN models, and trained VGG16, ResNet50,
DenseNet201, and InceptionV3 under the optimization of
SGD algorithm and Nadam algorithm. In the experiment of

trained the CNNs model, the performance of ResNet50 and
DensNet201 under the Nadam optimization algorithm is better than that of VGG16 and InceptionV3. On this basis,
we apply the Nadam optimization algorithm to ﬁne-tune the
pre-trained CNNs model and custom models to try to ﬁnd
the best classiﬁcation model. However, compared with the
classiﬁcation performance of Relief-SVM on the histopathological images of lung cancer subtypes, the DenseNet201
model still has a lower accuracy. In addition, we explored
the collocation and combination of different dropout rates
and learning rates under different experimental backgrounds.
The results of Fig. 16, 17, 18 shown that there is still an

trained DenseNet201 shows good performance in these three
combinations.
The results show that the Relief-SVM model built by
machine learning is more suitable for the classiﬁcation of

medical data sets, machine learning methods are often
more effective for classiﬁcation problems , – .

plays a role in the task of classiﬁcation of lung cancer
According to the survey, the patch-based image classiﬁcation method has been widely used in various histopathological images, which to a certain extent alleviates the problem
of difﬁcult and small number of medical image collection.
However, due to the complexity of the texture of the tissue image and the time-consuming process of image annotation, there are currently few medical image annotation

data with a large number and comprehensive labeling data.
In addition, since only image-level tags exist in the data set,
how to distinguish between patch-level tags and image-level
tags is a huge challenge for patch-based classiﬁcation
It is worth noting that in previous work, there have been
studies on classiﬁcation of lung cancer subtypes based on
computer-aided diagnosis. However, according to research,
there has not been any study that includes histopathological
images of ASC for automatic classiﬁcation. Therefore, this
study included ASC samples for the ﬁrst time. The Relief-
SVM model used in this paper can achieve an overall accuracy of more than 70%. This is a satisfactory result, which
can help the application of cytology in the diagnosis of lung
cancer. In addition, we also summarized the research related
to this article as shown in Table 13 , – .
In summary, the classiﬁcation capabilities of the Relief-
SVM model is superior to the trained CNNs, ﬁne-tuned

pre-trained CNNs model, and custom models. However, our
work also has some limitations. On the one hand, this study
collected a limited number of training set images from the initial stage to establish a more accurate classiﬁcation accuracy,
and did not try other numbers of training set images. If medical image data from multiple centers with different classiﬁcations can be used for research, the diversity of the data will
be further enhanced and the classiﬁcation performance of the
model will be improved. In addition, due to the general inﬂuence of external factors, the data set is susceptible to color
and noise. The use of the above image preprocessing methods
has certain limitations and may potentially affect the test
results. Therefore, when we face more abundant data sources
in the follow-up research, we should pay more attention to
the preparation and collection of histopathological images.
On the other hand, if a larger amount of lung histopathology
image data can be included for research, we will obtain more
complete disease information, which will further improve
the generalization of the classiﬁcation model. Therefore,
the histological subtype classiﬁcation of lung cancer based

to provide clinicians with more objective auxiliary diagnosis
V. CONCLUSION
This paper was the ﬁrst to apply the Relief-SVM algorithm to the classiﬁcation of LC histopathological images.
We included 121 histopathological images of LUSC, ASC
and SCLC. The experimental results show that Relief-SVM
has the best classiﬁcation performance in distinguishing lung
cancer subtypes, which provides a favorable guidance for
the classiﬁcation of lung histopathological images. And it
also provides a correct direction for the classiﬁcation of
medical images with complex texture tissue. In addition, this
paper analyzes and explores the classiﬁcation effects under
the traditional manual method of extracting features, trained
the CNNs model, ﬁne-tuning pre-trained CNNs models, and
custom models to ﬁnd which classiﬁcation model is more
suitable for the classiﬁcation of different subtypes of lung
The experimental results show that the Relief-SVM classiﬁcation model achieves best classiﬁcation performance
regardless of whether it is compared with CNN models which
are trained directly by using the histopathology image data set
or compared with the ﬁne-tuning pre-trained CNNs models
and custom models. In other words, when faced with a small
number of medical images, traditional manual methods have
shown great potential in the classiﬁcation of lung histopathological images. However, the CNN models which are trained
directly by using the histopathology image data set and the
ﬁne-tuning pre-trained CNNs models and custom models
CNN model show weak classiﬁcation performance.
Notably, our study has a considerable guiding function for
doctors with less experience, which can provide objective reference results and relieve the heavy work pressure of doctors.
It is feasible and practical to a certain extent. We will continue
to collect more samples from different central institutions
and build a lung histopathological image database for lung
diseases in the future.
