Abstract. Given a large, weighted graph, how can we ﬁnd anomalies?
Which rules should be violated, before we label a node as an anomaly?
We propose the OddBall algorithm, to ﬁnd such nodes. The contributions are the following: (a) we discover several new rules (power laws)
in density, weights, ranks and eigenvalues that seem to govern the socalled “neighborhood sub-graphs” and we show how to use these rules for
anomaly detection; (b) we carefully choose features, and design OddBall,
so that it is scalable and it can work un-supervised (no user-deﬁned constants) and (c) we report experiments on many real graphs with up to
1.6 million nodes, where OddBall indeed spots unusual nodes that agree
with intuition.
Introduction
Given a real graph, with weighted edges, which nodes should we consider as
“strange”? Applications of this setting abound: For example, in network intrusion detection, we have computers sending packets to each other, and we want
to know which nodes misbehave (e.g., spammers, port-scanners). In a who-callswhom network, strange behavior may indicate defecting customers, or telemarketers, or even faulty equipment dropping connections too often. In a social network, like FaceBook and LinkedIn, again we want to spot users whose behavior
deviates from the usual behavior, such as people adding friends indiscriminately,
in “popularity contests”.
The list of applications continues: Anomalous behavior could signify irregularities, like credit card fraud, calling card fraud, campaign donation irregularities, accounting ineﬃciencies or fraud , extremely cross-disciplinary authors in
an author-paper graph , network intrusion detection , electronic auction
fraud , and many others.
In addition to revealing suspicious, illegal and/or dangerous behavior, anomaly
detection is useful for spotting rare events, as well as for the thankless, but absolutely vital task of data cleansing . Moreover, anomaly detection is intimately related with the pattern and law discovery: unless the majority of our
nodes closely obey a pattern (say, a power law), only then can we conﬁdently
consider as outliers the few nodes that deviate.
Most anomaly detection algorithms focus on clouds of multi-dimensional
points, as we describe in the survey section. Our goal, on the other hand, is

to spot strange nodes in a graph, with weighted edges. What patterns and laws
do such graphs obey? What features should we extract from each node?
We propose to focus on neighborhoods, that is, a sphere, or a ball (hence the
name OddBall) around each node(the ego): that is, for each node, we consider
the induced sub-graph of its neighboring nodes, which is referred to as the egonet.
Out of the huge number of numerical features one could extract from the egonet
of a given node, we give a carefully chosen list, with features that are eﬀective
in revealing outliers. Thus, every node becomes a point in a low-dimensional
feature space.
Main contributions of this work are:
1. Egonet patterns: We show that egonets obey some surprising patterns (like
the Egonet Density Power Law (EDPL), EWPL, ELWPL, and ERPL), which
gives us conﬁdence to declare as outliers the ones that deviate. We support
our observations by showing that the ERPL yields the EWPL.
2. Scalable algorithm: Based on those patterns, we propose OddBall, a scalable,
un-supervised method for anomalous node detection.
3. Application on real data: We apply OddBall1 to numerous real graphs (DBLP,
political donations, and other domains) and we show that it indeed spots
nodes that a human would agree are strange and/or extreme.
Of course, there are numerous types of anomalies - we discuss several of them
in our technical report , but, for brevity, we focus on only the following major
types (see Fig.1 for examples and Section 2 for the dataset description):
1. Near-cliques and stars: Those nodes whose neighbors are very well connected (near-cliques) or not connected (stars) turn out to be “strange”: in
most social networks, friends of friends are often friends, but either extreme
(clique/star) is suspicious.
2. Heavy vicinities: If person i has contacted n distinct people in a who-callswhom network, we would expect that the number of phone calls (weight)
would be a function of n. Extreme total weight for a given number of contacts
n would be suspicious, indicating, e.g., faulty equipment that forces redialing.
3. Dominant heavy links: In the who-calls-whom scenario above, a very heavy
single link in the 1-step neighborhood of person i is also suspicious, indicating, e.g., a stalker that keeps on calling only one of his/her contacts an
excessive count of times.
The upcoming sections are as follows: We describe the datasets; the proposed
method and observed patterns; the experimental results; prior work; and ﬁnally
the conclusions.

set of blogs , Enron contains emails at Enron collected from about 1998 to
2002 (made public by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its
investigation), and Oregon contains AS peering information inferred from Oregon route-views BGP data. Bipartite networks include the following: Auth2Conf
contains the publication records of authors to conferences from DBLP, and
Don2Com and Com2Cand are from the U.S. Federal Election Commission in
20042, a public record of donations between donors and committees and between committees and political candidates, respectively.
For Don2Com and Com2Cand, the weights on the edges are actual weights
representing donation amounts in dollars. For the remaining weighted datasets,
the edge weights are simply the number of occurrences of the edges. For instance,
if post i contains k links to another post j, the weight of the edge ei,j is set to

easily be generalized to directed graphs.

Proposed Method
Borrowing terminology from social network analysis (SNA), “ego” is an individual node.
Informally, an ego (=node) of a given network is anomalous if its neighborhood signiﬁcantly diﬀers from those of others. The basic research questions are:
(a) what features should we use to characterize a neighborhood? and (b) what
does a ‘normal’ neighborhood look like?
Both questions are open-ended, but we give some answers below. First, let’s
deﬁne terminology: the “k-step neighborhood” of node i is the collection of node
i, all its k-step-away nodes, and all the connections among all of these nodes –
formally, this is the “induced sub-graph”. In SNA, the 1-step neighborhood of a
node is speciﬁcally known as its “egonet”.
How should we choose the value of k steps to study neighborhoods? Given
that real-world graphs have small diameter , we need to stay with small values
of k, and speciﬁcally, we recommend k=1. We report our ﬁndings only for k=1,
because using k > 1 does not provide any more intuitive or revealing information,
while it has heavy computational overhead, possibly intractable for very large
Feature Extraction
The ﬁrst of our two inter-twined questions is which statistics/features to extract
from a neighborhood.
There is an inﬁnite set of functions/features that we could use to characterize
a neighborhood (number of nodes, one or more eigenvalues, number of triangles,
eﬀective radius of the central node, number of neighbors of degree 1, etc etc).
Which of all should we use?
Intuitively, we want to select features that (a) are fast-to-compute and (b)
will lead us to patterns/laws that most nodes obey, except for a few anomalous
nodes. We spend a lot of time experimenting with about a dozen features, trying
to see whether the nodes of real graphs obey any patterns with respect to those
OddBall: Spotting Anomalies in Weighted Graphs
features (see our technical report ). The majority of features lead to no obvious
patterns, and thus we do not present them.
The trimmed-down set of features that are very successful in spotting patterns, are the following:
1. Ni: number of neighbors (degree) of ego i,
2. Ei: number of edges in egonet i,
3. Wi: total weight of egonet i,
4. λw,i: principal eigenvalue of the weighted adjacency matrix of egonet i.
The next question is how to look for outliers, in such an n-dimensional feature
space, with one point for each node of the graph. In our case, n=4, but one
might have more features depending on the application and types of anomalies
one wants to detect. A quick answer to this would be to use traditional outlier
detection methods for clouds of points using all the features.
In our setting, we can do better. As we show next, we group features into
carefully chosen pairs, where we show that there are patterns of normal behavior
(typically, power-laws). We ﬂag those points that signiﬁcantly deviate from the
discovered patterns as anomalous. Among the numerous pairs of features we
studied, the successful pairs and the corresponding type of anomaly are the
following:
– E vs N: CliqueStar: detects near-cliques and stars
– W vs E: HeavyVicinity: detects many recurrences of interactions
– λw vs W: DominantPair: detects single dominating heavy edge (strongly
connected pair)
Laws and Observations
The second of our research questions is what do normal neighborhoods look like.
Thus, it is important to ﬁnd patterns (“laws”) for neighborhoods of real graphs,
and then report the deviations, if any. In this work, we report some new, surprising patterns:
For a given graph G, node i ∈V(G), and the egonet Gi of node i;
Observation 1 (EDPL: Egonet Density Power Law) the number of nodes
Ni and the number of edges Ei of Gi follow a power law.
In our experiments the EDPL exponent α ranged from 1.10 to 1.66. Fig. 2
illustrates this observation, for several of our datasets. Plots show Ei versus Ni
for every node (green points); the black circles are the median values for each
bucket of points (separated by vertical dotted lines) after applying logarithmic
binning on the x-axis as in ; the red line is the least squares(LS) ﬁt on the
median points. The plots also show a blue line of slope 2, that corresponds to
cliques, and a black line of slope 1, that corresponds to stars. All the plots are
in log-log scales.

Observation 2 (EWPL: Egonet Weight Power Law) the total weight Wi
and the number of edges Ei of Gi follow a power law.
Fig. 3 shows the EWPL for (only a subset of) our datasets (due to space limit).
In our experiments the EWPL exponent β ranged up to 1.29. Values of β > 1
indicate super-linear growth in the total weight with respect to increasing total
edge count in the egonet.
Observation 3 (ELWPL: Egonet λw Power Law) the principal eigenvalue
λw,i of the weighted adjacency matrix and the total weight Wi of Gi follow a
power law.
0.5 ≤γ ≤1.
Fig. 4 shows the ELWPL for a subset of our datasets. In our experiments the
ELWPL exponent γ ranged from 0.53 to 0.98. γ=0.5 indicates uniform weight
distribution whereas γ˜1 indicates a dominant heavy edge in the egonet, in which
case the weighted eigenvalue closely follows the maximum edge weight. γ=1 if
the egonet contains only one edge.
Observation 4 (ERPL: Egonet Rank Power Law) the rank Ri,j and the
weight Wi,j of edge j in Gi follow a power law.
Here, Ri,j is the rank of edge j in the sorted list of edge weights. ERPL suggests
that edge weights in the egonet have a skewed distribution. This is intuitive; for
example in a friendship network, a person could have many not-so-close friends
(light links), but only a few close friends (heavy links).
Next we show that if the ERPL holds, then the EWPL also holds. Given an
egonet Gi, the total weight Wi and the number of edges Ei of Gi, let Wi denote
the ordered set of weights of the edges, Wi,j denote the weight of edge j, and
Ri,j denote the rank of weight Wi,j in set Wi. Then,
Lemma 1. ERPL implies EWPL, that is: If Wi,j ∝Rθ
i,j, θ ≤0, then
n β = 1, if −1 ≤θ ≤0
β > 1, if θ < −1
Proof. For brevity, we give the proof for θ < −1 – other cases are similar. If
Wi,j = cRθ
i,j, then Wmin = cEθ
i –the least heavy edge l with weight Wmin is
ranked the last, i.e. Ri,l = Ei. Thus we can write Wi as
Wi = WminE−θ
(−θ −1)E−θ−1
For suﬃciently large Ei and given θ < −1, the second term in parenthesis goes
to 0. Therefore; Wi ≈c′E−θ
, c′ = Wmin
−θ−1 . Since θ < −1, β > 1.

Anomaly Detection
We can easily use the observations given in part 3.2 in anomaly detection since
anomalous nodes would behave away from the normal pattern. Let us deﬁne
the y-value of a node i as yi and similarly, let xi denote the x-value of node i
for a particular feature pair f(x, y). Given the power law equation y = Cxθ for
f(x, y), we deﬁne the outlierness score of node i to be
out-line(i) = max(yi, Cxθ
min(yi, Cxθ
i ) ∗log(|yi −Cxθ
Intuitively, the above measure is the “distance to ﬁtting line”. Here we penalize
each node with both the number of times that yi deviates from its expected value
i given xi, and with the logarithm of the amount of deviation. This way, the
minimum outlierness score becomes 0 –for which the actual value yi is equal to
the expected value Cxθ
This simple and easy-to-compute method not only helps in detecting outliers,
but also provides a way to sort the nodes according to their outlierness scores.
However, this method is prone to miss some outliers and therefore could yield
false negatives for the following reason: Assume that there exist some points
that are far away from the remaining points but that are still located close to
the ﬁtting line. In our experiments with real data, we observe that this usually
happens for high values of x and y. For example, in Fig. 2(a), the points marked
with left-triangles (◁) are almost on the ﬁtting line even though they are far
away from the rest of the points.
We want to ﬂag both types of points as outliers, and thus we propose to
combine our heuristic with a density-based outlier detection technique. We used
LOF , which also assigns outlierness scores out-lof(i) to data points; but any
other outlier detection method would do, as long as it gives such a score. To
obtain the ﬁnal outlierness score of a data point i, one might use several methods
such as taking a linear function of both scores and ranking the nodes according
to the new score, or merging the two ranked lists of nodes, each sorted on a
diﬀerent score. In our work, we simply used the sum of the two normalized(by
dividing by the maximum) scores, that is, out-score(i) = out-line(i)+out-lof(i).
Experimental Results
CliqueStar Here, we are interested in the communities that the neighbors of a
node form. In particular, CliqueStar detects anomalies having to do with nearcliques and near-stars. Using CliqueStar, we were successful in detecting many
anomalies over the unipartite datasets (although it is irrelevant for bipartite
graphs since by nature the egonet forms a “star”).
In social media data Postnet, we detected posts or blogs that had either
all their neighbors connected (cliques) or mostly disconnected (stars). We show
some illustrative examples along with descriptions from Postnet in Fig. 1. See
Fig.2a for the detected outliers on the scatter-plot from the same dataset.

In Enron(Fig.2b), the node with the highest anomaly score turns out to be
“Kenneth Lay”, who was the CEO and is best known for his role in the Enron
scandal in 2001. Our method reveals that none of his over 1K contacts ever sent
emails to each other.
In Oregon (Fig.2c), the top outliers are the three large ISPs (“Verizon”,
“Sprint” and “AT&T”).

HeavyVicinity In our datasets, HeavyVicinity detected “heavy egonets”, with
considerably high total edge weight compared to the number of edges. We mark
the anomalies in Fig.3 for several of our datasets. See for results on all the
datasets and further discussions.
In Com2Cand(Fig.3a), we see that “Democratic National Committee” gave
away a lot of money compared to the number of candidates that it donated to.
In addition, “(John) Kerry Victory 2004” donated a large amount to a single
candidate, whereas “Liberty Congressional Political Action Committee” donated
a very small amount ($5), again to a single candidate. Looking at the Candidates
plot for the same bipartite graph (Fig.3b), we also ﬂagged “Aaron Russo”, the
lone recipient of that PAC. (In fact, Aaron Russo is the founder of the Constitution Party which never ran any candidates, and Russo shut it down after 18
In Don2Com(Fig.3c), we see that “Bush-Cheney ’04 Inc.” received a lot
of money from a single donor. On the other hand, we notice that the “Kerry
Committee” received less money than would be expected looking at the number
of checks it received in total. Further analysis shows that most of the edges in
its egonet are of weight 0, showing that most of the donations to that committee
have actually been returned.

In Postnet(Fig.4a) nodes such as “ThinkProgress”’s post on a leak scandal3
and “A Freethinker’s Paradise” post4 linking several times to the “ThinkProgress”
post were both ﬂagged. On another note, the slope of the ﬁtting line is close to
0.5, pointing to uniform weight distribution in egonets overall. This is expected
as most posts link to other posts only once.
In Com2Cand(Fig.4b), “Democratic National Committee” is one of the top
outliers. We would guess that the single large amount of donation was made
to “John F. Kerry”. Counterintuitively, however, we see that that amount was
spent for an opposing advertisement against “George W. Bush”.

DominantPair ﬂagged extremely focused authors (those publish heavily to
one conference) in the DBLP data, shown in Fig.3c. For instance, “Toshio
Fukuda” has 115 papers in 17 conferences (at the time of data collection), with
more than half (87) of his papers in one particular conference (ICRA). In addition, “Averill M. Law” has 40 papers published to the “Winter Simulation
Conference” and nowhere else. On the other extreme, another interesting point
is “Wei Li”, with many papers, who gets them published to as many distinct
conferences, probably once or twice to each conference (uniform rather than
‘bursty’ distribution).

Outlier Detection
Outlier detection has attracted wide interest, being a diﬃcult problem, despite
its apparent simplicity. Even the deﬁnition of the outlier is hard to give: For
instance, Hawkins deﬁnes an outlier as “an observation that deviates so
much from other observations as to arouse suspicion that it was generated by a
diﬀerent mechanism.” Similar, but not identical, deﬁnitions have been given by
Barnett and Lewis , and Johnson .
Outlier detection methods form two classes, parametric (statistical) and nonparametric (model-free). The former includes statistical methods that assume
prior knowledge of the underlying data distribution . The latter class includes distance-based and density-based data mining methods. These methods
typically deﬁne as an outlier the (n-D) point that is too far away from the rest,
and thus lives in a low-density area . Typical methods include LOF and
LOCI . These methods not only ﬂag a point as an outlier but they also give
outlierness scores; thus, they can sort the points according to their “strangeness”.
Many other density-based methods especially for large high-dimensional data sets
are proposed in . Finally, most clustering algorithms reveal
outliers as a by-product.
Anomaly Detection in Graph Data
Noble and Cook detect anomalous sub-graphs using variants of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Eberle and Holder use MDL as
well as other probabilistic measures to detect several types of anomalies (e.g.
unexpected/missing nodes/edges). Frequent subgraph mining is used to
detect non-crashing bugs in software ﬂow graphs . Chakrabarti uses MDL
to spot anomalous edges. Sun et al. use proximity and random walks, to
assess the normality of nodes in bipartite graphs. OutRank and LOADED use similarity graphs of objects to detect outliers.
In contrast to the above, we work with unlabeled graphs. We explicitly focus
on nodes, while interactions are also considered implicitly as we study neighborhood sub-graphs. Finally, we consider both bipartite and unipartite graphs as
well as edge weights.
OddBall: Spotting Anomalies in Weighted Graphs
Conclusion
This is one of the few papers that focus on anomaly detection in graph data,
including weighted graphs. We propose to use “egonets”, that is, the induced subgraph of the node of interest and its neighbors; and we give a small, carefully
designed list of numerical features for egonets. The major contributions are the
following:
1. Discovery of new patterns that egonets follow, such as patterns in density
(Obs.1: EDPL), weights (Obs.2: EWPL), principal eigenvalues (Obs.3: EL-
WPL), and ranks (Obs.4: ERPL). Proof of Lemma 1, linking the ERPL to
2. OddBall, a fast, un-supervised method to detect abnormal nodes in weighted
graphs. Our method does not require any user-deﬁned constants. It also
assigns an “outlierness” score to each node.
3. Experiments on real graphs of over 1M nodes, where OddBall reveals nodes
that indeed have strange or extreme behavior.
Future work could generalize OddBall to time-evolving graphs, where the challenge is to ﬁnd patterns that neighborhood sub-graphs follow and to extract
features incrementally over time.
